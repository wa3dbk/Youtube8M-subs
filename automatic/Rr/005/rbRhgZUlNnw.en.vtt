photos<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.789> everything<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.109> happen

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
photos of everything so that you happen

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
photos of everything so that you happen
to<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:20.850> good<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to get one really really good one it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.359 
to get one really really good one it
works

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:33.729 

no<00:00:25.369> it<00:00:25.789> doesn't<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:32.840> zone<00:00:33.020> system<00:00:33.379> was

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
no it doesn't the zone system was

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.380 
no it doesn't the zone system was
originally<00:00:34.309> developed<00:00:34.520> by<00:00:34.670> Ansel<00:00:35.000> Adams<00:00:35.210> and

originally developed by Ansel Adams and
Fred<00:00:35.510> Archer<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.070> what<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.190> gives<00:00:37.220> us<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.730> a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
Fred Archer and what it gives us is a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.140 
Fred Archer and what it gives us is a
huge<00:00:39.260> amount<00:00:39.559> of<00:00:39.620> control<00:00:40.040> over<00:00:40.250> tone<00:00:40.699> value

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
huge amount of control over tone value

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.000 
huge amount of control over tone value
and<00:00:41.390> over<00:00:42.140> our<00:00:42.170> light<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.710> over<00:00:42.920> our

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
and over our light and over our

the<00:00:46.550> scene<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:49.629> thing<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.720> remember<00:00:50.780> with

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the scene and the thing to remember with

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.810 
the scene and the thing to remember with
his<00:00:51.320> own<00:00:51.470> system<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.949> you<00:00:52.280> know<00:00:52.430> wow<00:00:52.580> it's<00:00:52.760> a

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
his own system is you know wow it's a

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.479 
his own system is you know wow it's a
whole<00:00:53.000> system<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.449> was<00:00:53.750> developed<00:00:54.489> with

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
whole system that was developed with

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.490 
whole system that was developed with
this<00:00:55.640> whole<00:00:56.120> system<00:00:56.540> for<00:00:56.720> film<00:00:56.930> developing

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
this whole system for film developing

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.469 
this whole system for film developing
and<00:00:58.129> making<00:00:58.370> prints<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:58.970> all<00:00:59.059> this<00:00:59.210> kind<00:00:59.449> of

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
and making prints and all this kind of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.140 
and making prints and all this kind of
stuff<00:00:59.540> the<00:01:00.350> core<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.920> zone<00:01:01.100> system<00:01:01.309> is<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
stuff the core of the zone system is the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.680 
stuff the core of the zone system is the
zone<00:01:02.299> scale<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:02.900> it's<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.559> scale<00:01:04.210> from<00:01:05.210> zero<00:01:05.600> to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
zone scale and it's a scale from zero to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.660 
zone scale and it's a scale from zero to
ten<00:01:05.990> in<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:08.479> one<00:01:09.080> stop<00:01:09.320> increments<00:01:09.860> okay<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
ten in in one stop increments okay so

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.760 
ten in in one stop increments okay so
what<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:14.650> zero

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
what you have is zero

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.539 
what you have is zero
pure<00:01:16.520> black<00:01:16.729> clips<00:01:17.659> black<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.710> then<00:01:19.159> all<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
pure black clips black and then all the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.660 
pure black clips black and then all the
way<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.729> ten<00:01:20.409> which<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:21.439> pure<00:01:22.010> clipped<00:01:22.430> white

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
way to ten which is pure clipped white

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.520 
way to ten which is pure clipped white
okay<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.270> everything<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.630> between<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.960> these

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
okay and everything in between is these

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.140 
okay and everything in between is these
different<00:01:24.950> shades<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.340> grey<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.030> it's

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
different shades of grey now it's

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.760 
different shades of grey now it's
representatives<00:01:26.720> shades<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.290> gray<00:01:27.439> in<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.560> but

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
representatives shades of gray in it but

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.660 
representatives shades of gray in it but
it<00:01:27.860> doesn't<00:01:28.130> matter<00:01:28.250> whether<00:01:28.490> you're

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
it doesn't matter whether you're

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.160 
it doesn't matter whether you're
shooting<00:01:28.759> color<00:01:29.090> black<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.630> white<00:01:29.750> or<00:01:29.929> film

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.870 
shooting color black and white or film
or<00:01:30.380> digital<00:01:30.469> it<00:01:30.890> doesn't<00:01:31.369> matter<00:01:31.520> it's<00:01:31.759> a

or digital it doesn't matter it's a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.810 
or digital it doesn't matter it's a
system<00:01:32.359> of<00:01:32.509> tonal<00:01:33.259> management<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.670> it's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
system of tonal management and it's

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.760 
system of tonal management and it's
terribly<00:01:35.420> powerful<00:01:35.570> now<00:01:36.289> what<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.439> have<00:01:36.619> here

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
terribly powerful now what I have here

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.349 
terribly powerful now what I have here
today<00:01:36.829> is<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.100> Pentax<00:01:37.429> digital<00:01:37.759> spot<00:01:37.939> meter<00:01:38.149> and

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
today is a Pentax digital spot meter and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.560 
today is a Pentax digital spot meter and
spot<00:01:39.079> metering<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.710> really<00:01:40.549> phenomenal<00:01:40.850> for

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
spot metering is really phenomenal for

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.480 
spot metering is really phenomenal for
you<00:01:42.079> know<00:01:42.170> using<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.920> zone<00:01:43.039> system<00:01:43.219> it's

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
you know using the zone system it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.520 
you know using the zone system it's
pretty<00:01:43.640> much<00:01:43.729> essential<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.450> what<00:01:45.289> you<00:01:45.380> can

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
pretty much essential and what you can

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.380 
pretty much essential and what you can
do<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.740> there<00:01:45.859> your<00:01:46.340> your<00:01:46.369> your<00:01:46.969> camera

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
do in there your your your camera

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.910 
do in there your your your camera
probably<00:01:47.840> has<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> spot<00:01:48.259> meter<00:01:48.469> in<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.770> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
probably has a spot meter in it a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.819 
probably has a spot meter in it a
handheld<00:01:49.909> spot<00:01:50.149> meter<00:01:50.359> is<00:01:50.869> very<00:01:51.200> powerful<00:01:51.530> but

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
handheld spot meter is very powerful but

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.709 
handheld spot meter is very powerful but
you<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.369> dig<00:01:53.030> into<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:53.299> concept<00:01:53.659> of

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
you can you can dig into the concept of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.289 
you can you can dig into the concept of
the<00:01:54.289> zone<00:01:54.439> system<00:01:54.799> right<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:55.119> using<00:01:56.119> the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
the zone system right now using the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.020 
the zone system right now using the
in-camera<00:01:56.659> meter<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:58.399> essence<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> zone

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
in-camera meter the essence of the zone

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.700 
in-camera meter the essence of the zone
system<00:01:59.359> in<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.509> zone<00:01:59.659> scales<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.499> core

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
system in the zone scales and the core

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.999 
system in the zone scales and the core
but<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:00.979> terms<00:02:01.249> of<00:02:01.490> exposure<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.749> this<00:02:03.079> let's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
but in terms of exposure is this let's

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.099 
but in terms of exposure is this let's
say<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:04.219> look<00:02:04.909> at<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> scene<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:05.450> I'm<00:02:05.569> in<00:02:05.990> this

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
say I look at a scene and I'm in this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.559 
say I look at a scene and I'm in this
vast<00:02:06.770> sweeping<00:02:07.670> Canyon<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:08.270> here<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.740> I

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
vast sweeping Canyon right here and I

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.970 
vast sweeping Canyon right here and I
think<00:02:11.569> about<00:02:11.750> my<00:02:12.110> tone<00:02:12.319> values<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.800> what<00:02:12.950> I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
think about my tone values and what I

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.180 
think about my tone values and what I
want<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.460> with<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.420> scene<00:02:14.860> okay<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.040> I'm

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
want to do with this scene okay so I'm

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.620 
want to do with this scene okay so I'm
starting<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.550> build<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.880> visualization<00:02:17.540> I'm

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
starting to build a visualization I'm

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.809 
starting to build a visualization I'm
starting<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.080> work<00:02:18.380> with<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.340> tone<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
starting to work with the tone and the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.270 
starting to work with the tone and the
light<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.209> let's<00:02:21.170> say<00:02:21.350> I'm<00:02:21.470> going<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> use<00:02:22.010> a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
light and let's say I'm going to use a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.410 
light and let's say I'm going to use a
reference<00:02:22.700> point<00:02:22.850> i'm<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.120> i'm<00:02:23.209> going<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
reference point i'm and i'm going to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.699 
reference point i'm and i'm going to
choose<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.660> main<00:02:23.959> subject<00:02:24.200> i'm<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
choose a main subject i'm going to

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.520 
choose a main subject i'm going to
choose<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> base<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.520> baseline<00:02:26.120> for<00:02:26.540> hop<00:02:27.170> where<00:02:27.500> i

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
choose a base a baseline for hop where i

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.470 
choose a base a baseline for hop where i
want<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.860> place<00:02:27.950> my<00:02:28.069> tones<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.970> let's<00:02:29.209> let's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
want to place my tones so let's let's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.850 
want to place my tones so let's let's
choose<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.020> stone<00:02:30.230> face<00:02:30.470> down<00:02:30.709> here

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
choose just the stone face down here

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.530 
choose just the stone face down here
that's<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.100> simple<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.610> start<00:02:31.850> with<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.450> I'm

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's a simple one to start with so I'm

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's a simple one to start with so I'm
going<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.690> meter<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.080> stone<00:02:33.290> face<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
going to meter on the stone face and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.720 
going to meter on the stone face and
it's<00:02:34.820> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> give<00:02:35.180> me<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.650> 13<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> third

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it's going to give me a 13 on the third

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.610 
it's going to give me a 13 on the third
okay<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.629> exposure<00:02:39.050> value<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
okay now that's exposure value and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.199 
okay now that's exposure value and
exposure<00:02:40.250> value<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.640> something<00:02:40.910> you've<00:02:41.030> seen

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
exposure value is something you've seen

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.270 
exposure value is something you've seen
in<00:02:41.330> your<00:02:41.450> camera<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:41.959> go<00:02:42.050> plus<00:02:42.290> 1/2<00:02:42.800> minus

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in your camera you can go plus 1/2 minus

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.250 
in your camera you can go plus 1/2 minus
1/2<00:02:43.519> well<00:02:44.180> that's<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.420> whole<00:02:44.540> system<00:02:45.019> that's<00:02:45.200> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
1/2 well that's a whole system that's a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.550 
1/2 well that's a whole system that's a
whole<00:02:45.379> system<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:46.840> an<00:02:47.840> older<00:02:48.170> meter<00:02:48.349> like

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
whole system that an older meter like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.199 
whole system that an older meter like
this<00:02:48.769> gives<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.400> direct<00:02:49.670> readings<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
this gives you direct readings in and

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.910 
this gives you direct readings in and
there's<00:02:50.330> still<00:02:50.510> meters<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:50.989> get<00:02:51.319> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
there's still meters you can get that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.170 
there's still meters you can get that
will<00:02:52.040> give<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.250> exposure<00:02:52.550> value<00:02:52.879> readings

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
will give you exposure value readings

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.880 
will give you exposure value readings
and<00:02:53.330> they're<00:02:53.420> they're<00:02:53.750> incredibly<00:02:54.140> handy<00:02:54.739> to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and they're they're incredibly handy to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.440 
and they're they're incredibly handy to
me<00:02:55.010> they're<00:02:55.250> much<00:02:55.819> better<00:02:56.000> than<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.269> meter

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
me they're much better than the meter

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.059 
me they're much better than the meter
that<00:02:56.599> just<00:02:56.780> tells<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.620> know<00:02:57.709> hit<00:02:57.890> use

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
that just tells you you know hit use

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.350 
that just tells you you know hit use
this<00:02:58.220> exposure<00:02:58.640> because<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.180> quickly

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
this exposure because I can quickly

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.440 
this exposure because I can quickly
point<00:02:59.690> in<00:03:00.130> meter<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.489> around<00:03:01.730> and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
point in meter like this around and

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.780 
point in meter like this around and
it'll<00:03:02.720> say<00:03:02.870> hey<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.230> stone<00:03:03.440> face<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> 13<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it'll say hey the stone face is a 13 the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.940 
it'll say hey the stone face is a 13 the
third<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.299> sky<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.810> 13<00:03:06.290> method<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.769> mean<00:03:06.890> I

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
third the sky is a 13 method I mean I

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.170 
third the sky is a 13 method I mean I
know<00:03:07.010> those<00:03:07.250> tone<00:03:07.459> values<00:03:07.760> are<00:03:07.879> roughly<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
know those tone values are roughly the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.150 
know those tone values are roughly the
same<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:08.569> can<00:03:08.780> quickly<00:03:09.200> determine<00:03:09.560> dynamic

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
same I can quickly determine dynamic

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.559 
same I can quickly determine dynamic
range<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.489> things<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.819> that<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.180> let's

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
range and things like that but let's

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.000 
range and things like that but let's
stay<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:11.720> tack<00:03:11.989> tasks<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.650> zones<00:03:12.830> will

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
stay on tack tasks of the zones will

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.330 
stay on tack tasks of the zones will
talk<00:03:13.130> about<00:03:13.250> meters<00:03:13.610> later<00:03:13.989> okay<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.980> got<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
talk about meters later okay so I got a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.940 
talk about meters later okay so I got a
13<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.819> third<00:03:16.970> on<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.209> stone<00:03:17.420> face<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
13 and a third on this stone face and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.440 
13 and a third on this stone face and
what<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.099> tells<00:03:19.310> me<00:03:19.549> is<00:03:19.610> is<00:03:19.880> how<00:03:20.120> much<00:03:20.269> light

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
what that tells me is is how much light

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.640 
what that tells me is is how much light
is<00:03:20.599> being<00:03:20.750> reflected<00:03:20.870> back<00:03:21.380> at<00:03:21.590> me<00:03:23.500> here's<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
is being reflected back at me here's the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.630 
is being reflected back at me here's the
thing<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:25.450> meter<00:03:26.680> when<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.799> meter<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.160> surface

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
thing a meter when you meter a surface

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.130 
thing a meter when you meter a surface
is<00:03:29.440> giving<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.849> reading<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:32.390> zone<00:03:32.569> 5

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
is giving you the reading for zone 5

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.380 
is giving you the reading for zone 5
zone<00:03:33.440> 5<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.920> middle<00:03:34.250> gray<00:03:34.430> now<00:03:34.910> let<00:03:35.060> me<00:03:35.120> repeat

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
zone 5 is middle gray now let me repeat

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.370 
zone 5 is middle gray now let me repeat
it<00:03:35.450> listen<00:03:35.810> very<00:03:35.930> carefully

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
it listen very carefully

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.020 
it listen very carefully
all<00:03:36.560> meters<00:03:37.430> are<00:03:38.560> giving<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.739> reading<00:03:40.099> for

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
all meters are giving you a reading for

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.210 
all meters are giving you a reading for
middle<00:03:41.239> gray<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.660> if<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.109> meter<00:03:42.500> something<00:03:43.100> if

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
middle gray so if you meter something if

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.680 
middle gray so if you meter something if

not what's the best exposure for the
scene<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.280> telling<00:04:01.609> you<00:04:01.730> what<00:04:01.760> we'll<00:04:02.180> put

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
scene it's telling you what we'll put

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.240 
scene it's telling you what we'll put
that<00:04:02.959> tone<00:04:03.200> value<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.709> light<00:04:03.980> being

reflected back at your lens at middle
gray<00:04:07.329> now<00:04:08.329> this<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.630> huge<00:04:08.870> because<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.200> don't

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
gray now this is huge because you don't

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.229 
gray now this is huge because you don't
always<00:04:09.530> want<00:04:09.769> everything<00:04:09.920> at<00:04:10.250> middle<00:04:10.459> gray<00:04:10.639> so

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
always want everything at middle gray so

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.750 
always want everything at middle gray so
on<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:12.260> one<00:04:12.350> hand<00:04:12.410> it's<00:04:12.920> like<00:04:13.100> well<00:04:13.280> that's

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
on the one hand it's like well that's

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.009 
on the one hand it's like well that's
kind<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> annoying<00:04:14.359> because<00:04:14.600> everything<00:04:14.959> is

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
kind of annoying because everything is

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.300 
kind of annoying because everything is
going<00:04:15.139> to<00:04:15.200> be<00:04:15.290> great<00:04:15.470> well<00:04:15.620> no<00:04:15.769> because<00:04:16.100> that's

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
going to be great well no because that's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.920 
going to be great well no because that's
that's<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.910> power<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.269> zone<00:04:17.419> system<00:04:17.780> that's

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that's the power the zone system that's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.319 
that's the power the zone system that's
what<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.139> zone<00:04:18.289> system<00:04:18.650> gives<00:04:18.889> us<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.820> knowing

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
what the zone system gives us so knowing

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.960 
what the zone system gives us so knowing
that<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.889> put<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.099> wherever<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:22.550> want<00:04:22.760> and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
that we can put it wherever we want and

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.520 
that we can put it wherever we want and
that's<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.330> beauties<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.050> zone<00:04:24.200> system

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
that's the beauties of the zone system

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.230 
that's the beauties of the zone system
remember<00:04:24.889> this<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.490> reading<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.940> exposure

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
remember this is reading the exposure

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.810 
remember this is reading the exposure
value<00:04:26.630> your<00:04:26.870> camera<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.800> stops<00:04:28.099> are<00:04:28.430> exposure

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
value your camera the stops are exposure

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.800 
value your camera the stops are exposure
value<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.440> zone<00:04:31.160> system<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.789> one<00:04:32.570> stop

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
value the zone system is one stop

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.839 
value the zone system is one stop
increments<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.530> like<00:04:33.650> exposure<00:04:34.039> value<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.820> I

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
increments just like exposure value so I

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.460 
increments just like exposure value so I
can<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.270> can<00:04:35.539> either<00:04:35.720> this<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.110> say<00:04:36.229> all<00:04:36.349> right

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
can I can either this and say all right

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.940 
can I can either this and say all right
great

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
great

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.159 
great
13<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.700> third<00:04:37.729> I'm<00:04:38.360> going<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.599> set<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.840> 13

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
13 and a third I'm going to set it to 13

13 and a third I'm going to set it to 13
a<00:04:39.200> third<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.710> exposure<00:04:40.039> value<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:41.060> 13

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
a third is the exposure value on this 13

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.570 
a third is the exposure value on this 13
my<00:04:41.539> third<00:04:41.690> stops<00:04:41.960> on<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.800> manual<00:04:43.039> meter<00:04:43.370> I'm

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
my third stops on this manual meter I'm

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.490 
my third stops on this manual meter I'm
going<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.760> manually<00:04:44.030> turn<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> dials<00:04:44.720> on<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.930> on

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
going to manually turn the dials on a on

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.790 
going to manually turn the dials on a on
a<00:04:46.180> electronic<00:04:47.180> meter<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:48.470> would<00:04:48.590> work<00:04:48.710> a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
a electronic meter it would work a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.050 
a electronic meter it would work a
little<00:04:48.979> bit<00:04:49.070> differently<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.610> concept

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
little bit differently but the concept

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.430 
little bit differently but the concept
is<00:04:50.120> going<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.330> be<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.570> same

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
is going to be the same

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.070 
is going to be the same
what<00:04:51.560> you're<00:04:51.680> going<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.860> do<00:04:52.040> is<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:53.960> this

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
what you're going to do is you have this

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.570 
what you're going to do is you have this
on<00:04:54.230> scale<00:04:54.500> okay<00:04:57.070> with<00:04:58.070> that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
on scale okay with that

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.340 
on scale okay with that
you<00:04:58.730> can<00:04:58.910> simply<00:04:59.240> decide<00:04:59.390> where<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.110> want<00:05:00.290> to

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
you can simply decide where you want to

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.790 
you can simply decide where you want to
place<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.680> tone<00:05:00.830> values<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:02.650> let's<00:05:03.650> say<00:05:03.770> I

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
place the tone values so let's say I

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.990 
place the tone values so let's say I
look<00:05:03.980> at<00:05:04.070> this<00:05:04.190> stone<00:05:04.370> face<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.670> I<00:05:04.700> say<00:05:04.880> no

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000

about more we're going to analyze images
we're<00:05:56.900> going<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.080> look<00:05:57.169> at<00:05:57.320> different

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
we're going to look at different

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.470 
we're going to look at different
scenarios<00:05:58.010> but<00:05:58.190> think<00:05:58.880> about<00:05:59.090> this<00:05:59.210> for<00:05:59.390> a

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
scenarios but think about this for a

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.790 
scenarios but think about this for a
moment<00:05:59.570> because<00:05:59.900> this<00:06:00.620> this<00:06:00.919> is<00:06:01.070> incredibly

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
moment because this this is incredibly

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.620 
moment because this this is incredibly
incredibly<00:06:03.800> powerful<00:06:04.669> you<00:06:05.060> know<00:06:05.150> let's<00:06:05.510> look

hey whatever I meter it's giving me a
zone<00:06:29.450> 5<00:06:29.900> reading<00:06:30.350> for<00:06:30.560> when<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.860> spot<00:06:31.130> meter<00:06:31.600> now

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
zone 5 reading for when I spot meter now

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120 
zone 5 reading for when I spot meter now
we're<00:06:33.140> going<00:06:33.230> to<00:06:33.290> go<00:06:33.410> into<00:06:33.590> a<00:06:33.890> bit<00:06:34.100> more

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
we're going to go into a bit more

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.980 
we're going to go into a bit more
details<00:06:34.640> on<00:06:34.910> how<00:06:35.060> different<00:06:35.390> meters<00:06:35.510> work<00:06:35.780> and

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
details on how different meters work and

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.080 
details on how different meters work and
stuff<00:06:36.169> like<00:06:36.320> that<00:06:36.560> in<00:06:36.770> it<00:06:37.700> that's<00:06:37.880> going<00:06:38.030> to

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
stuff like that in it that's going to

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.460 
stuff like that in it that's going to
that's<00:06:38.270> something<00:06:38.480> for<00:06:38.660> another<00:06:38.810> episode<00:06:39.050> so

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
that's something for another episode so

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.750 
that's something for another episode so
let's<00:06:39.560> just<00:06:39.830> kind<00:06:40.040> of<00:06:40.100> focus<00:06:40.370> on<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.520> spot

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
let's just kind of focus on the spot

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.670 
let's just kind of focus on the spot
meter<00:06:40.940> if<00:06:41.090> you're<00:06:41.210> working<00:06:41.390> in<00:06:41.690> camera<00:06:42.230> you

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
meter if you're working in camera you

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.500 
meter if you're working in camera you
can<00:06:42.830> set<00:06:43.040> your<00:06:43.160> in-camera<00:06:43.550> settings<00:06:44.090> to<00:06:44.270> spot

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
can set your in-camera settings to spot

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.850 
can set your in-camera settings to spot
