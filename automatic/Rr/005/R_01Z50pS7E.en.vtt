00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.490 
chassis and as you can see you have to
sprint<00:01:10.320> jump<00:01:11.150> no<00:01:12.150> strafe<00:01:12.600> jump<00:01:12.840> no<00:01:13.049> sprint<00:01:13.380> in

midair and as you can see you bounce

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
midair and as you can see you bounce
straight<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> top<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.799> corner<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
straight off the top of that corner on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.410 
straight off the top of that corner on
the<00:01:17.790> car<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.950> looks<00:01:20.159> like

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
the car so this is what it looks like

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.560 
the car so this is what it looks like
killing<00:01:21.420> someone<00:01:21.720> simply<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.299> just<00:01:24.299> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
killing someone simply off it just like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.789 
killing someone simply off it just like
that<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> here's<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> bounce<00:01:27.600> again<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that so here's the bounce again this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
that so here's the bounce again this
bounce<00:01:29.100> does<00:01:29.430> take<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> few<00:01:30.420> tries<00:01:30.840> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
bounce does take quite a few tries to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
bounce does take quite a few tries to
actually<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> perfect<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.210> once<00:01:33.420> you've

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
actually get it perfect but once you've

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually get it perfect but once you've
hit<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> first<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.530> you'll<00:01:34.770> start

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
hit it the first time you'll start

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.010 
hit it the first time you'll start
you'll<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> you'll<00:01:36.720> start

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you'll get to know it and you'll start

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.660 
you'll get to know it and you'll start
hitting<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.619> often<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
hitting it more often this is the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
hitting it more often this is the
opponent's<00:01:41.670> view<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.720> hitting<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
opponent's view of you hitting it as you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.620 
opponent's view of you hitting it as you
can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> bounced<00:01:44.790> straight<00:01:45.240> off<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> back<00:01:45.600> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to have to run round here and it's just

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
to have to run round here and it's just
by<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.869> wall<00:02:04.320> by<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> central<00:02:05.159> building<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
by this wall by the central building so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
by this wall by the central building so
you<00:02:06.450> want<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.020> top<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.409> brown<00:02:07.680> all

you want to get on top of this brown all

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.680 
you want to get on top of this brown all
right<00:02:08.280> here

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
right here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.690 
right here
well<00:02:08.810> yeah<00:02:08.960> I'll<00:02:09.590> pump<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.040> wall<00:02:10.370> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
well yeah I'll pump to this wall and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.930 
well yeah I'll pump to this wall and
then<00:02:11.300> move<00:02:11.630> right<00:02:11.990> back<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.500> where<00:02:12.680> this<00:02:12.980> metal

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
then move right back to where this metal

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.390 
then move right back to where this metal
pole<00:02:14.510> thing<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.070> have<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.310> do

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
pole thing is and you can have to do

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.650 
pole thing is and you can have to do
exactly<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.910> same<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.270> did<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> first

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
exactly the same as you did on the first

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.190 
exactly the same as you did on the first
bounce<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.320> jump<00:02:18.590> right<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.520> edge<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
bounce so jump right on the edge of the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.660 
bounce so jump right on the edge of the
car<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.800> as

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
car as you do it so and there you go as

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.450 
car as you do it so and there you go as
you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.970> see<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.140> don't<00:02:27.860> know<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.130> it's

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
you can see this I don't know if it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.210 
you can see this I don't know if it's
necessary<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.660> found<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.470> easy<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.950> did<00:02:31.190> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
necessary but I found it easy if I did a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.810 
necessary but I found it easy if I did a
little<00:02:31.430> sprint<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.510> hit<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.990> bounce<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
little sprint as I hit the bounce and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.270 
little sprint as I hit the bounce and
you'll<00:02:34.820> see<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.270> from<00:02:35.570> here<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.920> sprint

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
you'll see this from here so I sprint

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190 
you'll see this from here so I sprint
jump<00:02:37.550> with<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.030> little<00:02:38.270> thing<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.720> air<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
jump with a little thing in the air and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.740 
jump with a little thing in the air and
as<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.190> hit<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.460> like<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.150> so

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
as you can see I hit it like that so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
as you can see I hit it like that so
little<00:02:42.140> sprint

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.910 

easy<00:02:45.770> as<00:02:46.010> pie

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
easy as pie

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.650 
easy as pie
I'm<00:02:48.920> not<00:02:49.130> sure<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.460> sprint<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.150> midair<00:02:50.480> is

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
I'm not sure if that sprint in midair is

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.440 
I'm not sure if that sprint in midair is
necessary<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.910> found<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.330> little

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
necessary but I just found it a little

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.500 
necessary but I just found it a little
easier<00:02:53.900> anyway

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
easier anyway

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.640 
easier anyway
opponents<00:02:56.510> view<00:02:56.930> as<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:59.380> Johnny<00:03:00.380> did

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
opponents view as you can see Johnny did

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.890 
opponents view as you can see Johnny did
the<00:03:00.740> little<00:03:00.890> sprint<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.490> well<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.000> he<00:03:02.690> gets

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
the little sprint as well and he gets

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.980 
the little sprint as well and he gets
the<00:03:03.020> kill<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.530> easily<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.750> moving<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
the kill really easily so moving on to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.470 
the kill really easily so moving on to
the<00:03:06.080> next<00:03:06.290> one<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:07.130> one<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.430> slightly<00:03:07.760> harder

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the next one this one is slightly harder

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.180 
the next one this one is slightly harder
than<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.780> other<00:03:08.960> two<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.440> found<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> bit

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
than the other two we found it a bit

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.790 
than the other two we found it a bit
more<00:03:10.640> difficult<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.900> once<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.350> fit<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.620> once

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
more difficult but once you fit it once

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.280 
more difficult but once you fit it once
it's<00:03:13.070> easy<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.820> get<00:03:13.970> again<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.080> have<00:03:15.170> to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
it's easy to get again so you have to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.260 
it's easy to get again so you have to
run<00:03:15.530> right<00:03:15.770> back<00:03:16.010> towards<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> flag<00:03:17.150> on

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
run right back towards the a flag on

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.330 
run right back towards the a flag on
domination<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.200> you're<00:03:18.709> gonna<00:03:18.830> have<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.010> come

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
domination and you're gonna have to come

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340 
domination and you're gonna have to come
around<00:03:19.459> here<00:03:19.670> jump<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:20.810> top<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.110> little

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
around here jump on top of this little

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.770 
around here jump on top of this little
fridge<00:03:21.800> lying<00:03:22.220> down<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:23.090> jump<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:23.510> top<00:03:23.660> of

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
fridge lying down then jump on top of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.990 
fridge lying down then jump on top of
this<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.110> bin<00:03:24.740> dumpster<00:03:25.490> thing<00:03:25.700> whatever

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
this like bin dumpster thing whatever

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.780 
this like bin dumpster thing whatever
you<00:03:26.120> want<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.330> call<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.170> see<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.790> dead

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
you want to call it and you see the dead

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.510 
you want to call it and you see the dead
end<00:03:28.970> sign<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.290> leaning<00:03:30.770> out<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.250> that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
end sign that is leaning out like that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.550 
end sign that is leaning out like that
right<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> corner<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.440> two

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
right on the corner you can have two

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.140 
right on the corner you can have two
spring<00:03:33.950> jump<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.880> you're<00:03:35.840> gonna<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.380> hit

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
spring jump and you're gonna have to hit

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.850 
spring jump and you're gonna have to hit
the<00:03:38.150> lower<00:03:38.709> point<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.340> sign<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:42.320> think

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the lower point of that sign now I think

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.229 
the lower point of that sign now I think
a<00:03:43.280> strafe<00:03:43.700> jump<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.739> probably<00:03:45.739> much<00:03:46.370> easier<00:03:46.820> to

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
a strafe jump is probably much easier to

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.270 
a strafe jump is probably much easier to
do<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.810> air<00:03:47.989> but<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.920> see<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:52.040> quite

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
do the air but as you can see it's quite

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.890 
do the air but as you can see it's quite
hard<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.730> hit<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.239> once<00:03:53.450> you've<00:03:53.630> got<00:03:53.870> it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
hard to hit but once you've got it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.190 
hard to hit but once you've got it
you'll<00:03:54.320> do<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.709> almost<00:03:55.610> every<00:03:55.940> time<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.570> there

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
you'll do it almost every time and there

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.640 
you'll do it almost every time and there
you<00:03:57.320> go<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.070> simple<00:03:58.280> kill<00:03:58.700> off<00:03:59.180> it<00:04:00.110> now

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
you go just a simple kill off it now
