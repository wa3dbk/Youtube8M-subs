00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610 

all<00:00:00.390> right<00:00:00.539> I've<00:00:00.690> been<00:00:00.719> studying<00:00:01.110> on<00:00:01.410> these

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
all right I've been studying on these

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.030 
all right I've been studying on these
axles<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.250> bit<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.460> think<00:00:02.730> I'm<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:04.040> change

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
axles a bit I think I'm going to change

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.980 
axles a bit I think I'm going to change
my<00:00:05.250> mind<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.640> my<00:00:05.910> plan<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.600> thinking

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
my mind about my plan I was thinking

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.450 
my mind about my plan I was thinking
about<00:00:07.080> putting<00:00:07.500> them<00:00:07.589> back<00:00:07.740> just<00:00:07.799> like<00:00:08.220> they

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
about putting them back just like they

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.140 
about putting them back just like they
are<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> axles<00:00:10.250> under<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> springs<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
are with the axles under the springs and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.669 
are with the axles under the springs and
just<00:00:12.780> mounting<00:00:13.170> them<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.440> I'm<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.620> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
just mounting them because I'm going to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
just mounting them because I'm going to
have<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.150> springs<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> come

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
have the springs are going to come

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.240 
have the springs are going to come
outside<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.320> side<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> trailer<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
outside the side of the trailer and I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.910 
outside the side of the trailer and I
thinking<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.640> could<00:00:17.820> move<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.590> pipe<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.800> I'm

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
thinking I could move the pipe that I'm

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
thinking I could move the pipe that I'm
going<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> weld<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.939> uh<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to weld all this to uh but you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080 
going to weld all this to uh but you
know<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.910> looking

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
know the more I look at it I'm looking

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.080 
know the more I look at it I'm looking
to<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:25.310> spring<00:00:26.310> mounts<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.820> here

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
to how these spring mounts are on here

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.450 
to how these spring mounts are on here
and<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.830> little<00:00:28.830> spot<00:00:29.160> weld

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and there's like one little spot weld

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
and there's like one little spot weld
right<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:30.380> one<00:00:31.380> little<00:00:31.560> spot<00:00:31.890> weld<00:00:32.130> right

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
right there one little spot weld right

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
right there one little spot weld right
there<00:00:32.550> probably<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:33.930> each<00:00:34.290> side

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
there probably about one on each side

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.040 
there probably about one on each side
and<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.780> stairs

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and I think about out there at stairs

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
and I think about out there at stairs
just<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.440> ahead<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> cut<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.250> old

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
just go ahead and cut out these old

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.080 
just go ahead and cut out these old
u-bolts<00:00:39.149> cut<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> spring<00:00:40.770> mounts<00:00:41.190> flip

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
u-bolts cut out the spring mounts flip

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
u-bolts cut out the spring mounts flip
them<00:00:42.239> over<00:00:42.390> put<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> other<00:00:43.320> side<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
them over put them on the other side one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.680 
them over put them on the other side one
thing<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.579> made<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.789> decide<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> was

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
thing that made me decide to do that was

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.049 
thing that made me decide to do that was
there's<00:00:45.870> no<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.489> there<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.579> nothing<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
there's no way there was nothing on the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
there's no way there was nothing on the
bottom<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> line<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
bottom here to line that up with that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
bottom here to line that up with that
hole<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.539> was

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
hole it's just I don't know if there was

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.319 
hole it's just I don't know if there was
something<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.530> ain't<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
something there but there ain't this

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
something there but there ain't this
little<00:00:54.329> piece<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> was

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
little piece right here if that was

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.819 
little piece right here if that was
flipped<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:56.160> fall<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> hole

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
flipped over would fall into that hole

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
flipped over would fall into that hole
looks<00:00:58.829> almost<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.579> frames<00:00:59.940> were<00:01:00.120> made

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
looks almost like these frames were made

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
looks almost like these frames were made
to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.469> side<00:01:01.800> anyway<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.850> going

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to be on the other side anyway I'm going

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.250 
to be on the other side anyway I'm going
to<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.629> grinder<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.110> going

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to just take my little grinder I'm going

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
to just take my little grinder I'm going
to<00:01:04.320> cut<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.780> u-bolts<00:01:07.490> cut

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to cut off all of these u-bolts cut

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
to cut off all of these u-bolts cut
these<00:01:08.670> off<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.270> flip<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.810> over

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
these off here flip them over

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
these off here flip them over
use<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.159> new<00:01:11.340> wealth<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.790> extension<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.450> I

use my new wealth or extension that I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
use my new wealth or extension that I
made<00:01:12.810> bring<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.290> welder<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.040> weld<00:01:14.430> these

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
made bring my welder out here weld these

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
made bring my welder out here weld these
brackets<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:16.200> side<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.560> axle

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
brackets on the other side of this axle

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.039 
brackets on the other side of this axle
and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.299> back<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and then put them all back on with the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
and then put them all back on with the
spring<00:01:19.380> under<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> axle<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:20.820> hook<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
spring under the axle and then hook it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
spring under the axle and then hook it
all<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.860> gonna<00:01:22.979> take<00:01:23.159> a

all up and then I can I'm gonna take a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.649 
all up and then I can I'm gonna take a
piece<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> pipe<00:01:23.909> over<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.299> weld<00:01:24.509> them

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
piece of the pipe over there weld them

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
piece of the pipe over there weld them
together<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> straight<00:01:25.680> bar<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
together make me a straight bar that I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.080 
together make me a straight bar that I
can<00:01:26.430> weld<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.180> mounting<00:01:27.740> brackets<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
can weld all of my mounting brackets to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
can weld all of my mounting brackets to
and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.600> slide<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.259> whole<00:01:31.530> unit

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and then I can slide this whole unit

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.710 
and then I can slide this whole unit
under<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> trailer<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:35.360> kind<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
under the trailer and kind of get it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.940 
under the trailer and kind of get it
sitting<00:01:36.960> where<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.200> wanted<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> then

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sitting where I wanted to be and then

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.719 
sitting where I wanted to be and then
weld<00:01:38.400> those<00:01:38.990> bars<00:01:39.990> along<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.619> side<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
weld those bars along the side right to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.149 
weld those bars along the side right to
the<00:01:41.850> outside<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.770> adjust<00:01:43.860> my

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the outside here and I can adjust my

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
the outside here and I can adjust my
height<00:01:44.520> based<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.720> sit<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
height based on how they sit on the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
height based on how they sit on the
trailer<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.680> might<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.220> harder<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
trailer that might be harder to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
trailer that might be harder to
understand<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.229> saying<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
understand then it is for me saying it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.539 
understand then it is for me saying it
and<00:01:50.250> thinking<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.500> once<00:01:53.340> y'all
