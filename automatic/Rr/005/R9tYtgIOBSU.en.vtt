00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.190
 my name is chemi elm, I've been a voice actor for 11 years 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.399
 different production and media areas of the Basque Country and Madrid 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.769
 I've been in this profession all this time JosÃ© folded movies series 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.669
 of documentary cartoons infinity of documentaries for channels 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.409
 of the country or as discovery channel natural channel history 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.669
 the cartoon network 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.930
 and I'm in love with this profession 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.700
 the kind of characters that only do this when they want but especially 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.810
 the character is a little histrionic 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.640
 and they are characters that you love because it forces you to work 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.300
 only of synchrony because synchrony seems to me to be the basis of 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.250
 dubbing and it's not the basis of doping 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.480
 the basis is basically the interpretation by giving life to what 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.860
 you're making the juiciest actors to carry are the most clues and they 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 the most unique aristide are the most dramatic no 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.150
 ea and actors to whom you take affection because they have been left over the course of a 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 series over a long time 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.700
 and you end up taking them affection and you end up having a kind of connection 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 invisible with them you do not end up learning their tics their tricks and 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.960
 true that you put them in your soul 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.490
 I remember works that folded cartoons that I liked a lot 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.430
 they were called 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 a lot of shock that forced me to force my throat an awful lot but it's 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.420
 the villain who was 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.600
 it was hilarious I remember some movies that we have dubbed in the country 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.960
 Basque as for example read good Cuba says of infinity of films for 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.659
 erreka or the producer that now owns American that has brought lots of 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.910
 old movies 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.660
 that have been talked back to here that things were never achieved have been achieved 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.420
 here 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.100
 old characters to whom you have to put a voice has given the voice not 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.689
 you really have to give them a little bit more interpretation 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.350
 kubica kneading 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770
 but a slightly older interpretation does not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.820
 age and series that have caught my attention such as when 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.920
 we made the second dubbing born music dv of the american hero 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.980
 ells no longer that of police ld that the baby max arrived was the post was very 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.730
 fun because he had a special savvy and I caught him a lot 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.590
 Honey remembers that character with a lot of love because he was also a challenge 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.470
 aberrant that character worked for the second time after I already 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.119
 did the ranch fÃ©lix perhaps 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:27.669
 that were already missing and good was a challenge marked another point of 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:31.099
 view of that dubbing and to do it because it was also way tremendously 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.249
 nice or there are not many characters that you stay with others are 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.609
 known as hunters of myths that is a documentary documentary for discovery 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.240
 channel 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.300
 very funny of two crazy people who do experiments and put them to the test to see 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.480
 if they are true but also they do it with a tremendous show a deployment 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.879
 of impressive media 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.439
 and there is my daughter and my mind is one of the two that I put the forest 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.779
 very laconic very laconic throughout so many chapters because you take it 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.159
 darling the truth is that there are characters that you really stay with 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.620
 the heart
