00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it paused the video real quick and we

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.460 
it paused the video real quick and we
actually<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:37.229> at<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
actually have it right here up at the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
actually have it right here up at the
top<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.689> out

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
top as you can see there we can back out

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
top as you can see there we can back out
to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> home<00:01:40.380> screen<00:01:40.680> while<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.610> thing

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to the home screen while this thing

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.690 
to the home screen while this thing
reloads<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.500> works<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.009> fine<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.460> can

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
reloads and it works just fine we can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
reloads and it works just fine we can
kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> snap<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.600> around<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> sides

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
kind of snap it around to the sides

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.780 
kind of snap it around to the sides
there<00:01:46.649> let's<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.009> ahead<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> play

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
there let's go ahead and get that play

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
there let's go ahead and get that play
in<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:49.049> basically<00:01:49.409> drag<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
in there and just basically drag it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
in there and just basically drag it
wherever<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:52.049> cool

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wherever we want to it's pretty cool

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
wherever we want to it's pretty cool
though<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> also<00:01:53.100> resize<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.479> if

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
though and you can also resize it so if

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
though and you can also resize it so if
you<00:01:54.720> double<00:01:55.079> tap<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> drag<00:01:55.740> you'll<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> able

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you double tap and drag you'll be able

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
you double tap and drag you'll be able
to<00:01:56.850> resize<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> windows<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.780> check<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.079> out

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to resize the windows so check this out

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.719 
to resize the windows so check this out
I'm<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> double<00:01:58.740> tap<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.310> drag

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I'm going to double tap and then drag

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
I'm going to double tap and then drag
and<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.930> resize<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.829> big<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.490> small

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and I can resize it as big or as small

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
and I can resize it as big or as small
as<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.939> want<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.630> also<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:04.140> fullscreen

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
as I want now I can also go fullscreen

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.950 
as I want now I can also go fullscreen
with<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.729> want<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.270> keep<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
with it if I want to just keep in and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.150 
with it if I want to just keep in and
check<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.380> what's<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> video

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
check out what's going on in the video

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
check out what's going on in the video
on<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.209> bigger<00:02:09.720> screen<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.069> full

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
on the bigger screen or you know in full

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.490 
on the bigger screen or you know in full
size<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.730> guess<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.599> do<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
size I guess like this you can do that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
size I guess like this you can do that
if<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.040> enough<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.790> also<00:02:14.820> do<00:02:15.330> have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
if that's not enough you also do have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
if that's not enough you also do have
the<00:02:15.570> ability<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.110> toggle<00:02:16.530> transparency<00:02:17.490> here

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the ability to toggle transparency here

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790 
the ability to toggle transparency here
so<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.000> tap<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:18.960> double<00:02:19.620> tap

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
so if we tap on it here double tap

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
so if we tap on it here double tap
actually<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.460> have<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> ability<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.240> make<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
actually you have the ability to make it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.320 
actually you have the ability to make it
transparent<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.830> maybe<00:02:23.370> you're<00:02:23.760> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
transparent there so maybe you're you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.090 
transparent there so maybe you're you
know<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.870> YouTube<00:02:25.200> app<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.740> you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
know in the YouTube app and you're you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.260 
know in the YouTube app and you're you
have<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:26.730> you're<00:02:26.850> trying<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.090> read

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
have it down here you're trying to read

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.000 
have it down here you're trying to read
you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.600> actually<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.350> text<00:02:28.770> right

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you can actually see the text right

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
you can actually see the text right
through<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> video<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.840> know<00:02:30.990> why

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
through the video and I don't know why

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.570 
through the video and I don't know why
you'd<00:02:31.500> want<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.370> little

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you'd want to do that it's a little

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.460 
you'd want to do that it's a little
distracting<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.330> me<00:02:33.390> personally<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.140> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
distracting for me personally but it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.010 
distracting for me personally but it
does<00:02:34.890> get<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.130> job<00:02:35.460> done<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.910> does<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.780> well

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
does get the job done and does it well

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
does get the job done and does it well
it's<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.770> pretty<00:02:38.010> cool<00:02:38.220> tweak<00:02:38.580> though<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> mean

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it's a pretty cool tweak though I mean

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.240 
it's a pretty cool tweak though I mean
it's<00:02:39.240> very<00:02:39.420> very<00:02:39.570> functional<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's very very functional and like I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.010 
it's very very functional and like I
said<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.760> go<00:02:42.060> ahead<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.270> make<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.690> bigger

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
said you can go ahead and make it bigger

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.990 
said you can go ahead and make it bigger
or<00:02:43.110> smaller<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.890> by<00:02:44.070> double<00:02:44.430> tapping<00:02:44.670> and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
or smaller just by double tapping and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210 
or smaller just by double tapping and
dragging<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> simple<00:02:46.620> double<00:02:47.040> tap

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
dragging and just a simple double tap

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.580 
dragging and just a simple double tap
well<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.700> ahead<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.930> transparent

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
well go ahead and make it transparent

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.680 
well go ahead and make it transparent
like<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.790> mean<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.090> think<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.540> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
like that I mean I think this is a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.810 
like that I mean I think this is a
pretty<00:02:52.080> cool<00:02:52.380> tweak<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:53.220> definitely<00:02:53.670> useful

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
pretty cool tweak it's definitely useful

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.570 
pretty cool tweak it's definitely useful
on<00:02:54.240> an<00:02:54.420> iPad<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.230> said<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> mean<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.340> can

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
on an iPad like I said I mean you can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.370 
on an iPad like I said I mean you can
use<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:56.970> an<00:02:57.120> iPhone<00:02:57.209> as<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:58.200> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
use it on an iPhone as well but I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.740 
use it on an iPhone as well but I
personally<00:02:59.190> find<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.490> way<00:02:59.670> more<00:02:59.700> useful<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.540> an

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
personally find it way more useful on an

now<00:03:13.770> sometimes<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.550> had<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.850> issue

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
now sometimes I have had this issue

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.940 
now sometimes I have had this issue
where<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> black<00:03:15.780> screen<00:03:16.080> pulls<00:03:16.410> up<00:03:16.560> until<00:03:16.920> I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
where a black screen pulls up until I

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.920 
where a black screen pulls up until I
play<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> cursor<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:18.690> eventually

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
play with the cursor and then eventually

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.900 
play with the cursor and then eventually
it<00:03:19.170> will<00:03:19.440> it'll<00:03:19.920> come<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> most

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
it will it'll come up but for the most

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.060 
it will it'll come up but for the most
part<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.239> definitely<00:03:21.780> works<00:03:21.930> every<00:03:22.530> time<00:03:22.800> now

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
part it definitely works every time now

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.009 
part it definitely works every time now
the<00:03:23.459> best<00:03:23.610> part<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.120> doesn't<00:03:24.150> only<00:03:24.510> work<00:03:24.840> in

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the best part is it doesn't only work in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.620 
the best part is it doesn't only work in
YouTube<00:03:25.380> it'll<00:03:25.920> work<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.220> iTunes<00:03:26.730> previews<00:03:27.450> or

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
YouTube it'll work in iTunes previews or

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.120 
YouTube it'll work in iTunes previews or
movies<00:03:27.959> that'll<00:03:28.170> work<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.440> Netflix<00:03:28.680> it'll

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
movies that'll work in Netflix it'll

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.490 
movies that'll work in Netflix it'll
work<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.670> video<00:03:30.000> app<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:30.989> definitely

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
work in the video app so it's definitely

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.860 
work in the video app so it's definitely
a<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.920> versatile<00:03:32.850> tweak<00:03:33.120> when<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.420> comes<00:03:33.660> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a very versatile tweak when it comes to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870 
a very versatile tweak when it comes to
its<00:03:34.080> applications<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.519> compatible

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
its applications that it is compatible

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.050 
its applications that it is compatible
with<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.260> also<00:03:37.530> set<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.970> know

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
with now we can also set that you know

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.699 
with now we can also set that you know
how<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.330> double<00:03:39.660> tapping<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.530> make

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
how is double tapping on there to make

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.710 
how is double tapping on there to make
it<00:03:40.739> transparent<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.269> set<00:03:42.600> that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
it transparent you can actually set that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.420 
it transparent you can actually set that
to<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.870> something<00:03:43.140> custom<00:03:43.769> here<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.280> go

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
to be something custom here and if we go

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.820 
to be something custom here and if we go
into<00:03:44.610> activator<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.320> anywhere

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
into activator and just go to anywhere

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.479 
into activator and just go to anywhere
and<00:03:47.190> scroll<00:03:47.880> down<00:03:48.180> until<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.110> see<00:03:49.260> video<00:03:49.980> pane
