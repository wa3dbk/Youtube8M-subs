00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hi today i'm here to make you a video of 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.450
 two smoothies he kept very easy that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.460
 They have just fruit and water 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 I had to kill because I 'm a thing 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.719
 healthy and for those like me who don't 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.510
 eat fruit a good thing 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.359
 a great alternative first thing 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.720
 I take raspberries 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 according to blueberries and third banana 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.390
 or a banana only first 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:38.129
 the banana in round slices 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.140
 blender and solved choose me myself 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.890
 I find that the banana looks great on it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.110
 all the ways and in fact I use it in all 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 How many 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 and here after I take a handful of 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.800
 raspberries was launched then also of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.850
 Now add the cranberries 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:12.330
 simple water I add type 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 300ml of water and whisk one thing 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 maybe I could do was filter it then 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.689
 because maybe little pieces don't like a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 all the more slam the slightly 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.939
 mixer because at least I can make it better 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.720
 the fruit breaks all and then the whole 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:36.270
 pouring into this jar that anna giard 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.060
 half-liter bormioli 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 and I add all my smoothing and then 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.939
 there is a but a small straw for 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.159
 to be able to drink it with simplicity and use it 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.060
 red like that for the sake of being in 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.540
 pandan the second one is this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 very yellow summer smoothie but 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.130
 very good and is my favorite among the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.649
 two 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.110
 first, this is not a smoothie 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:10.910
 Bananas and Mango is indeed we use two 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.160
 words for this smoke and half mango 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.510
 and that's what's left to me then 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 broken the mango and put it in the mixer e 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.360
 then always broken into washers and two 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.360
 bananas 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.050
 really this is my favorite 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.300
 even though he knows a lot about banana and me 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.310
 I don't love bananas like that below 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.090
 made smoothies so i like them 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.950
 a lot now I always add the 300 ml 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.940
 I do it with good or bad water 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:59.470
 eye and mix it all for a couple of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 minutes and I think they are a real boon 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.530
 from the sky this kind of smoothies 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.299
 because they're good then overwhelmed 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
 always in the same jar and also here 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.610
 I add a straw in this case 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.989
 blue and nothing so this is the video is 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120
