00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 well it him everyone knows the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.480
 xtreme motors chain to introduce you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.540
 to introduce you to my 50 derbi gpr 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.950
 limited edition so I do you a little 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 round 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 so here's the poke that centers and at 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 middle so I hid the plate 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.100
 Low registration is a little 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 normal those who will understand they will 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 why so I did not buy snow 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 I bought used so we are 100 years old 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 in exile by losing the world so I 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.160
 said they do more so you see 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 who if she is still a little damaged 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.200
 and there too it'll no good 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 bad 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 the front of the bike here's that's it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610
 so we went around a little bit so the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 so crutch the speed selector 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 it's a homologated place so it's 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.500
 here but makes it small but I think 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 I will not take someone anyway 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.079
 behind me so here is the keys bah 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.439
 I will start it for you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 to show a little here is to put the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.110
 sense you have to suspect 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:20.939
 so wait i'm going to start it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:25.009
 here I'm posing salah so here it is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.009
 So to tranquil 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.730
 nicolas la calais pascal is not something 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.730
 is not heated before malignant 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.890
 here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 so you see she still has a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 noise of saint quentin but frankly 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 okay so I cut the engine so that's 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 a six-speed gearbox 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.039
 so yeah the counter so a box 6 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.899
 velocities to montagnat and unbridled fair 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.329
 by the pot there is just the pot it is 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.149
 flanged to go up to 92 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.660
 finally against between 90 and 95 so that's okay 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.860
 so here at the here are so here 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 it's a fair presentation for you 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.340
 show my bike that I had yesterday 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.530
 so Saturday, June 20, 2015 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.780
 so that was the first video of the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.099
 chain xtreme motors for for 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.120
 to represent a bit of my motorcycle that you 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.319
 ask my friend to introduce his motorcycle 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.450
 and all I'm going to lend him copro 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.079
 for to do it's also his 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.760
 presentation 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.280
 so here it is and very really very light 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.630
 like motorcycle was really good so 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.920
 derby it's good engines frankly 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.200
 finally I find it's blow I was 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.670
 leave this morning and then so nothing 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 time must go back to 7000 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.630
 rounds pretty much here so that saïd the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.030
 potato so you just accelerated after 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.920
 excess speed cholet teeth 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.269
 vegetables a tower pretty much 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.819
 after frankly it really leaves 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.079
 quiet for a 50th to go up to 95 I 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.069
 you say so it's pretty good I 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.739
 think when the descent was taking a 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.780
 to take a little without bone that I 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.489
 think it's beautiful so this is I 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.139
 tell you next time it was the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.139
 chain extra motors and baï everyone
