00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.370
 in your profile page that you organize 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.899
 finally you liked to cook for big 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.960
 tabled ie what do you have a 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.460
 big family you have a lot of friends 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 does 2 it often happens unexpectedly 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.020
 little message by the way yes I also 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.180
 for large tables 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.250
 and I like to cook simple things 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.830
 which are done quickly with what we 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.270
 has in the fridge and that it tastes good 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.310
 well it's perfect and we're going 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 attack the recipe manu there we go 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.850
 start with the ingredients well 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.850
 obviously how many apples one is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 between 5 and 6 apples agree 150 g of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 flour 150 g brown sugar and 150 g 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.800
 of half-salt butter okay and a little 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.240
 little cinnamon for the tangy touch 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.520
 good well it's perfect we start 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.930
 by which to peel the apples 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.700
 what was his name then that's the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.140
 chore climbs to do I recommend you 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 still choose a nice mold 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.350
 because in fact you can serve 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 directly at the table I think it's great 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.119
 friendly me to take out the dish from the oven 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.860
 to embalm the room and put it in 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.399
 centerpieces so here I take a 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.290
 just a little bit of butter just for 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.680
 butter the bottom of the mold by cutting 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.229
 cube 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.170
 yes so let's say cubes of 2 cm by 2 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.729
 or so you fight did and if it's okay 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.280
 do not you do it again and here's a day 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.869
 accurate is the recipe for manuela and 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.030
 that they were wooden chain and I 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.240
 been hired as assistant go 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 start my little paw so the butter 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.319
 so actually you take it out of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.110
 fridge still a lot of time before 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.959
 because as we are going to have to knead it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.660
 if it's cold and hard it's impossible 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 butter half salt it will break a small 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.120
 little sugar and art this essay this is 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.500
 not bad so 150 g of butter 150 g of 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.940
 flour we put all at the same time it's 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.010
 them 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.050
 we do not take the lead and so for the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.060
 sugar always 150 g so we go in 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.860
 keep a little bit for after so 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 I advise you to put some 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.630
 this is in the test of small spoons 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.319
 side soup and rather from the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.030
 brown sugar 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.340
 I think it caramelizes a little bit 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.080
 better and it's more fun and a little 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.910
 cinnamon stick in the dough and 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.240
 now it's the relaxation part for 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.240
 kneaded 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 you can sprinkle a little bit these 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.160
 apples one with a little bit of 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.900
 brown sugar that we have here for the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.310
 caramelized side because with the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.000
 heat in fact it's going to caramelize the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.710
 women it's top 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.350
 what are 2 tablespoons or and 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.760
 yes no more other way is a whole 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.060
 little bit of cinnamon also before 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.370
 that I'm dispersing the college of pine 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 yes everywhere I have the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.490
 dough trying to make small 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.880
 molds not by accumulating fat 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.670
 parts 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.940
 no more sanding no because actually 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.620
 it will spread out and well it's going to the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.650
 cooking here so we can still 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.240
 specify that we put the oven to 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.310
 preheated to 200 degrees there we are ready 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.930
