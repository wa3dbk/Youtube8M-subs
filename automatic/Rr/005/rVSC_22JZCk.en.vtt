 even from the official side of

 but sledgehammer games confirmed 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.199

 they have me on facebook and on 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.600
 twitter posted a picture where you can see 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 what the whole dlc involves and did 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020
 you also have a few screenshots 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 I wanted to publish and I wanted to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.260
 Now make a video and catch it now 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 We first with the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 day of publication and that is the 31st 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.270
 march first for xbox live members that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 means people who own an xbox 360 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.430
 or an xbox of that can ec 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.079
 From the age of 31 , others play 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.539
 People who have a pc or a playstation 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.729
 unfortunately have to have a month again 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 wait then there are four again 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.060
 new multiplayer cards for a time 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.170
 244 climate perplex and topshop and on 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.330
 I would not continue this now 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 Yes, there was one more 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750
 small description to each card but 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.189
 I do not really want that now 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.420
 I will read to you in the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.189
 Link description in any case 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.150
 or the other screenshots too 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.710
 these cards 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420
 but now I will first to the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 next thing and go to the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
 new weapon or rather said is so new 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.780
 he does not care about who around wolf 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 which is already longer in the trade or 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.369
 have a season pass for the people 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 on the xbox 360 or on the xbox 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 they want to play this already 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.770
 time about two three weeks I think 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.850
 and he off because I would 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.680
 probably also for the playstation 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.990
 or for the pc player 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 be available and you have to 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.259
 of course have a season pass 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.909
 otherwise if you do not have a compass 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.240
 Can you get this weapon if you can 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.880
 the dt buys and that is kind of a4 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.070
 also such an energetic weapon the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.229
 you can either play as a light mg 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.280
 Can or is a shotgun 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.350
 not really one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.390
 actually a pretty good weapon i 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.550
 faith is one 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 really if the weapon if you do not 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.940
 patched because I heard it 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.010
 should be pretty good, maybe 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 a bit too good, but I'm like that anyway 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.400
 I can do little multiplayer games there 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 a little less from own experience 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.230
 then there is a new thing to talk about 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.180
 and indeed a new ability in the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.550
 multiplayer that means it will be one 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.170
 enter the arms of the wehr people 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.660
 have already played campaign 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 know on the one to higher levels 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.320
 just can pull with son 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.330
 enter and that will be in this 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.440
 playlist in this essentials playlist 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.090
 be available 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.010
 I'm pretty curious how the whole then 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.530
 because it will have to be somehow 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 so be that on certain things 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.459
 or in certain places then 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.050
 can hold around then so over to 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.870
 I'm really looking forward to it like that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.070
 all brought in with it and yes 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.480
 I will also probably times 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.950
 Try and now we come 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 probably the most important and 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 besides that, my people or mine 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.769
 subscribers probably want to know 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.530
 the new ex combo card the hostess 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.970
 faction and yes there was one 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.610
 small description I in German 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.709
 translated and this is it 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.650
 sends cc also brings a new card 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.989
 for exodus the returning celebrities 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.780
 occupation of John Malkovich Bill Paxton 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.000
 Ross McGanan and Sean Penn fight great 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 with 10 and nails through and words and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.620
 combo hoard around them in their fight 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.450
 as well as to help bring the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.640
 players another arsenal of weapons 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.130
 and case can use and if they are one 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.810
 longtime fan of the offender are able 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.269

 discover the zombie-filled ruins yes 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.959
 It is time for another one 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.480
 travel to burger town 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.650
 you've heard burger sound it will be 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.600
 give again and in the background 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.950
 count also in burger town sign me 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.150
 have a screenshot for you 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.530
 where you all this a bit more 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.209
 but look bigger, I'm pretty 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.090
 looking forward to it all at once 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.160
 burger ton koopman times out of mw2 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.690
 can the man still with the mission 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 bourgeoisie or from the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.190
 campaign the citizen town or on time 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.799
 but also represent bourgeois faith 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.540
 if I did not quite care about everyone 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.950
 I'm pretty curious and me 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.930
 also cool that he also old 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.420
 reinstall things as now 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.190
 burger town he does not see you otherwise 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.380
 really much on the small picture two 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.239
 things are still extremely noticed and 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.980
 though the two bigger zombies in the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.800
 foreground to one of the shafts or 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.500
 the middle zombies are pretty g8 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.210
 pretty crazy and sick for he has 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.220
 Show that strong body and I can 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.650
 I just do not think about this hobby 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.780
 that's another and new zombie 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 Type of species will be like, for example 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.080
 zombie with spines that is because you 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.260
 you might get that touch 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.670
 more harm or if you kill him then 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.560
 somehow the rigid ones acquire 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.660
 weggesprengt and you come along with harm 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.030
 if a sting he could hit you 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.700
 imagine a pretty cool thing 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.560
 and then there is the left zombie 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.720
 pretty much noticed then pretty much 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.700
 heavily armored and so rather attracts 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.930
 bit after the boss zombie out though 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.390
 maybe it's just one 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.340
 other zombie art and yes that special 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.560
 it's just that he's on top of him 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.350
 his back a rocket launcher or a 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.940
 Machine gun I want so sick 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.950
 if it suddenly pointed to the skis 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.530
 with rocket or so when quite 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.450
 be curious how these zombie species are 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.520
 In any case, you will see these 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.190
 look at two zombies in the foreground 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.690
 what they will bring with them and 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.700
 Now I've said yes I'm in 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.620
 screenshot nor was also 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.560
 posted on the twitter and on 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.750
 the facebook page of call of duty resp 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.140
 sledgehammer games and you can see that 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.340
 here again in large citizens trust 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.450
 or a section of the 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.340
 card and what will actually only 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.290
 noticed that you still there 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.880
 somehow go underground 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.340
 back there on the side I'm going to 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.810
 then to and otherwise nothing falls 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.340
 further one also sees one behind 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.730
 probably the shopping center is called 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.200
 and yes, you can see one more 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.310
 open manhole cover probably 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.020
 Only zombies will bonn 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.570
 I could only imagine that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.980
 that was the same with outbreak 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.990
 otherwise yes, nothing is actually 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.610
 Another eye-catching in one looks 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.680
 I just do not know anything 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.420
 exactly if that is still some wall weapon 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.220
 or maybe that's the 3d 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.680
 Printer is unfortunately only possible here 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.390
 to see a pizza bad otherwise 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.310
 it's not that noticeable 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.380
 is indeed that it was now actually 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.380
 already to the newest news in the 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.540
 adventure of r &amp; d c number two ends it 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.100
 if there are new things because 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.020
 soon he will also be a teaser 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.490
 probably will follow again then 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.100
 Of course, I upload that again 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.600
 and an analysis on main channel 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.729
 I hope you have the video 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.479
 please see you next time 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.479
 Europe
