including<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.330> original<00:01:34.479> size<00:01:34.960> okay<00:01:35.680> so<00:01:35.740> we

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
including the original size okay so we

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.389

can go large original and so on and
that's<00:01:42.520> as<00:01:42.729> difficult<00:01:43.179> as<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.569> is<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.720> insert

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
that's as difficult as it is to insert

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.850 
that's as difficult as it is to insert
an<00:01:44.920> individual<00:01:45.640> picture<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:46.869> sometimes<00:01:47.530> what

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
an individual picture but sometimes what

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.020

we<00:01:48.009> want<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.310> do<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.170> what's<00:01:50.979> more<00:01:51.220> economical

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
we want to do and what's more economical

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.660

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
and by that I mean rather than having a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.219 
and by that I mean rather than having a
list<00:01:59.830> of<00:02:00.009> pictures<00:02:00.429> down<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.119> page<00:02:01.869> that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
people have to scroll to see we can

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.949 
people have to scroll to see we can
actually<00:02:05.080> create<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:06.220> little<00:02:06.819> photo<00:02:07.149> slideshow

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959

now one of the minor annoyances with
these<00:03:46.710> slide<00:03:46.980> shows<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:48.140> interval

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
these slide shows is that the interval

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.250 
these slide shows is that the interval
is<00:03:49.320> fairly<00:03:49.830> short<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:51.090> some<00:03:51.630> people<00:03:51.900> complain

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
is fairly short and some people complain

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
is fairly short and some people complain
that<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.620> images<00:03:53.070> go<00:03:53.220> by<00:03:53.400> too<00:03:53.460> quickly

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
that the images go by too quickly

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.760 
that the images go by too quickly
especially<00:03:54.360> if<00:03:54.750> there<00:03:54.990> are<00:03:55.020> captions<00:03:55.680> that

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770

need to be read users need to be aware I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.550 
need to be read users need to be aware I
suppose<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.210> they<00:04:00.360> do<00:04:00.420> have<00:04:00.780> some<00:04:00.840> control

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
suppose that they do have some control

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.310 
suppose that they do have some control

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
here that control will appear and that's
