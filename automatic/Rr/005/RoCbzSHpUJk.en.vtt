00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
I feel like I don't know like the skin

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.480 
I feel like I don't know like the skin
feels<00:01:11.880> weird<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.490> easily

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
feels weird and it's like easily

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
feels weird and it's like easily
irritated<00:01:15.330> when<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.840> rubbing<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
irritated when I'm rubbing them so I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 
irritated when I'm rubbing them so I
don't<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.520> has<00:01:17.759> anything<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.810> do

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
don't know if that has anything to do

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't know if that has anything to do
with<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> serum<00:01:20.759> maybe<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.720> does<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.259> don't

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
with the serum maybe it does I don't

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370 
with the serum maybe it does I don't
think<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> itching<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> serum

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
think that the itching is from the serum

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.580 
think that the itching is from the serum
I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.390> allergies<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I think it's just allergies and I I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.960 
I think it's just allergies and I I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:22.020 

and<00:02:14.170> let's<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.860> sign<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:21.340> put<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and let's do this sign I will put in the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.809 
and let's do this sign I will put in the
pictures<00:02:22.510> comparing<00:02:23.260> day<00:02:23.620> 1<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.610> today<00:02:25.239> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
pictures comparing day 1 to today and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.509 
pictures comparing day 1 to today and
that<00:02:27.819> way<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.300> tell<00:02:28.950> what<00:02:29.950> difference<00:02:30.370> it

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
that way you can tell what difference it

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:45.630 
that way you can tell what difference it
really<00:02:30.550> has<00:02:31.000> made<00:02:44.069> do<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.100> feel<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.489> my

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
really has made do you feel like my

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.380 
really has made do you feel like my
lashes<00:02:45.880> are<00:02:46.269> longer<00:02:46.959> but<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.980> guess<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.970> don't

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
lashes are longer but I guess I don't

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.110 
lashes are longer but I guess I don't
really<00:02:49.630> pay<00:02:49.870> attention<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.280> thickness<00:02:51.610> of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
really pay attention to the thickness of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.229 
really pay attention to the thickness of
my<00:02:52.750> lashes<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.260> how<00:02:53.590> full<00:02:54.130> they<00:02:54.340> are<00:02:54.370> looking

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
my lashes and how full they are looking

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.690 
my lashes and how full they are looking
at<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> pictures<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.980> my<00:02:57.280> lashes

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
at the pictures I can see that my lashes

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.000 
at the pictures I can see that my lashes
actually<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.690> look<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.049> little<00:02:59.200> bit<00:02:59.410> fuller<00:02:59.650> I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
actually do look a little bit fuller I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
actually do look a little bit fuller I
don't<00:03:00.220> know<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.489> guys<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.910> tell<00:03:00.970> if<00:03:01.510> you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
don't know if you guys can tell if you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.449 
don't know if you guys can tell if you
want<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> let<00:03:02.349> me<00:03:02.440> know<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.040> think<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
want to let me know if you think that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.759 
want to let me know if you think that
they've<00:03:03.610> gotten<00:03:03.940> longer<00:03:04.330> or<00:03:04.599> fuller<00:03:04.959> or<00:03:05.319> maybe

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
they've gotten longer or fuller or maybe

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.979 
they've gotten longer or fuller or maybe
you<00:03:05.980> think<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.970> looks<00:03:07.209> exactly<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.720> same

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
you think it looks exactly the same

you think it looks exactly the same
I<00:03:08.140> don't<00:03:08.319> know<00:03:08.440> but<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.220> think<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.599> so

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
I don't know but I think that is it so

I'm going to be doing like the two month

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.770 
I'm going to be doing like the two month

and<00:03:34.989> then<00:03:35.109> compare<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.040> give<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> guys

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
and then compare just to give you guys

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.090 
and then compare just to give you guys
an<00:03:36.640> idea<00:03:37.019> because<00:03:38.019> also<00:03:38.530> maybe<00:03:38.769> you'll<00:03:38.980> be

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
an idea because also maybe you'll be

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.610 
an idea because also maybe you'll be
able<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.609> more<00:03:39.790> results<00:03:39.880> if<00:03:40.329> there's<00:03:41.319> more

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
able to see more results if there's more

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.220 
able to see more results if there's more
time<00:03:41.889> in<00:03:42.130> between<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.299> think<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.019> is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
time in between but I think that that is

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.940 
time in between but I think that that is
it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
it

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.729 
it
and<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.120> does<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.329> for<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:47.170> four<00:03:47.560> week

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
and that does it for the four week

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.319 
and that does it for the four week
update<00:03:47.980> be<00:03:48.609> sure<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.850> give<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.030> video<00:03:49.180> a
