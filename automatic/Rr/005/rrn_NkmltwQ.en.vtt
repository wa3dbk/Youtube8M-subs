 Reviews of games VKontakte our regular guest 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.630
 this game called racing online 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 well the name says it all 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 race in general then let's get started 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.880
 tab 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.730
 start from the end tab rewards you can 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 create your cards editor so but we 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.660
 let's not do it back saw so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.690
 further settings you can customize the game 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.399
 so here is the quality of the graphics and everything 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 keyboard what buttons do they mean 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.340
 so you can see all the further choice 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.650
 the car 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.320
 So 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.300
 In general, this is his first can be 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 paint the netherlands 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.290
 here is a lot of strange here is Russian 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.850
 painting in general is how I car 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.850
 I am currently available 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.400
 but these are now inaccessible and you them 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.950
 I can not choose because they need 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.200
 30 reputation points reputation 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.540
 this is for that is this reputation 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.040
 earned by inviting friends 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.400
 so go ahead the game further divided 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 screen 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 that is, you can click to play with 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.280
 another for example on one computer then 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.760
 there is a half screen divided 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 multiplayer is a race start list 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.619
 online racing 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.900
 this is single in general let's try 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:08.510
 multiplayer will not go to go there 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.869
 where a lot of people from 5 people think 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.869
 fine 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.620
 I do not plan to do a reviewer 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:24.109
 such a big box can be in general 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.680
 here Russian chat is present by the way 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:32.519
 I think go to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.470
 Well, the main essence of the show the game was 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.629
 with study 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:43.709
 activated by pressing the button n 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:45.989
 russian white is english but in 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.730
 keyboard settings will be all 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:54.870
 so you can see the game fun 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.099
 I will not like playing friends 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.099
 this boy is interrupting 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.569
 matter of course machines do not have a very diana 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.530
 i'm not powerful for this level let's 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.069
 let's try to come over here though 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.550
 try 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.370
 race 1 go and think it will be possible 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.350
 round out 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.730
 small such review and this by the way 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.650
 small date card 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.650
 in 15 seconds you can and doctors 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.770
 about 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.930
 neatly no to runet life 2 came 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.660
 that from seconds i usually have to come 15 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.490
 Okay, Iâ€™ll try to go, of course. 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:04.350
 master in the corners okay for review 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.350
 I think that's enough experience 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.650
 I think we'll try everything last time 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:21.260
 much depends on the machine itself 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:22.450
 cars like better and I even at first 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.370
 the place was filled 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:32.840
 cool as there is a car 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:37.180
 maybe you need to earn some 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.550
 medals medals are earned by Putin 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.960
 the game is not in racing that is you play 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.970
 the game 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.850
