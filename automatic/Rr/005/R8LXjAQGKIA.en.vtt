00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is a flow through design and then you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.670 
is a flow through design and then you
have<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> black<00:02:56.970> pocket<00:02:57.480> clip<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:58.049> POC

really<00:03:00.569> nice<00:03:00.810> retention<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.739> only<00:03:01.950> thing<00:03:02.100> is

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
really nice retention the only thing is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.490 
really nice retention the only thing is
it<00:03:02.519> only<00:03:02.850> comes<00:03:03.209> set<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:03.989> tip<00:03:04.260> down

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.190 
it only comes set up for tip down
right-handed<00:03:05.310> carry<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:05.959> basically<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
right-handed carry so basically if you

don't like tip down or you're

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.400 
don't like tip down or you're
left-handed<00:03:09.390> user<00:03:09.780> something<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
left-handed user something like that

jumping on the liner lock there which

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.330 
jumping on the liner lock there which
makes<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.199> easy<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.500> engage<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.220> disengage

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
makes it easy to engage and disengage

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.210 
makes it easy to engage and disengage
and<00:04:41.910> then<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.870> flipper<00:04:43.229> actually<00:04:43.620> turns<00:04:43.919> into

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
and then the flipper actually turns into

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.790 
and then the flipper actually turns into
a<00:04:44.370> finger<00:04:44.819> guarded<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:46.289> know<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.680> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
a finger guarded and you know in the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.730 
a finger guarded and you know in the
modified<00:04:47.220> choil<00:04:47.610> there<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.199> medium<00:04:49.530> sized

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
modified choil there it's a medium sized

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.800 
modified choil there it's a medium sized
knife<00:04:50.009> so<00:04:50.430> obviously<00:04:51.060> as<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.270> guys<00:04:51.419> can<00:04:51.599> see<00:04:51.660> I

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
knife so obviously as you guys can see I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.110 
knife so obviously as you guys can see I
get<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.139> full<00:04:52.500> four<00:04:53.160> finger<00:04:53.490> purchase<00:04:53.849> on<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
get a full four finger purchase on the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.650 
get a full four finger purchase on the
knife<00:04:54.270> itself<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:55.530> blade<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.060> 3.25<00:04:57.060> inches

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
knife itself the blade is 3.25 inches

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.469 
knife itself the blade is 3.25 inches
and<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:59.280> overall<00:04:59.310> length<00:04:59.849> of<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.030> knife<00:05:00.240> is

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
and the overall length of the knife is

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.300 
and the overall length of the knife is
7.75<00:05:01.430> inches<00:05:02.430> now<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.419> net<00:05:03.930> comes<00:05:04.199> in<00:05:04.440> as<00:05:05.039> far

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
7.75 inches now the net comes in as far

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.249 
7.75 inches now the net comes in as far
as<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> weight<00:05:05.699> goes<00:05:05.880> at<00:05:06.150> four<00:05:06.389> ounces<00:05:06.840> so

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
as the weight goes at four ounces so

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.770 
as the weight goes at four ounces so
it's<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.620> nice<00:05:08.009> mountable<00:05:08.580> weight<00:05:08.789> which<00:05:09.599> is

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
it's a nice mountable weight which is

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.960 
it's a nice mountable weight which is
pretty<00:05:10.259> nice<00:05:10.470> now<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.070> steel<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.759> is

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
pretty nice now the steel on this is

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.560 
pretty nice now the steel on this is
actually<00:05:12.330> 5c<00:05:13.169> are<00:05:13.380> 13<00:05:14.039> I<00:05:14.820> don't<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.449> any

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
actually 5c are 13 I don't have any

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.089 
actually 5c are 13 I don't have any
experience<00:05:16.020> on<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.229> steel<00:05:16.440> itself<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.070> I

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
experience on the steel itself so I

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.999 
experience on the steel itself so I
can't<00:05:17.580> tell<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:19.169> know<00:05:19.259> how<00:05:19.440> will<00:05:19.620> perform

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
can't tell you you know how will perform

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.649 
can't tell you you know how will perform
or<00:05:20.130> anything<00:05:20.370> like<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.580> but<00:05:20.909> it<00:05:21.030> does<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.449> a

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
or anything like that but it does have a

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.020 
or anything like that but it does have a
high<00:05:21.900> V<00:05:22.229> grind<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.830> blade<00:05:23.310> itself<00:05:23.490> and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
high V grind on the blade itself and

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.510 
high V grind on the blade itself and
there<00:05:24.509> is<00:05:24.599> a<00:05:24.630> spear<00:05:25.139> point<00:05:25.349> blade<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:26.490> blade

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
there is a spear point blade the blade

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.610 
there is a spear point blade the blade
itself<00:05:26.789> is<00:05:27.180> pretty<00:05:27.630> sterile<00:05:27.990> there's<00:05:28.380> no

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
itself is pretty sterile there's no

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620 
itself is pretty sterile there's no
markings<00:05:29.159> or<00:05:29.370> anything<00:05:29.759> on<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:29.970> blade<00:05:30.389> and

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
markings or anything on the blade and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.149 
markings or anything on the blade and
the<00:05:30.720> only<00:05:31.229> way<00:05:31.409> they're<00:05:31.560> telling<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:31.979> is<00:05:32.039> a

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
the only way they're telling this is a

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.710 
the only way they're telling this is a
Maxpedition<00:05:32.699> knife<00:05:32.849> is<00:05:33.060> because<00:05:33.389> of<00:05:33.419> the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
Maxpedition knife is because of the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.050 
Maxpedition knife is because of the
marking<00:05:34.560> on<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.770> actual<00:05:35.039> handle<00:05:35.520> there<00:05:35.699> so

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
marking on the actual handle there so

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.760 
marking on the actual handle there so
again<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:36.990> know<00:05:37.080> if<00:05:37.199> you<00:05:37.289> don't<00:05:37.440> like<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.590> lot

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
again you know if you don't like a lot

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.320 
again you know if you don't like a lot
of<00:05:38.039> stuff<00:05:38.310> written<00:05:38.520> on<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.789> blade<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.000> stuff

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
of stuff written on the blade and stuff

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.999 
of stuff written on the blade and stuff
like<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.479> then<00:05:39.870> this<00:05:40.050> would<00:05:40.199> be<00:05:40.349> a<00:05:40.380> pretty

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
like that then this would be a pretty

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.839 
like that then this would be a pretty
good<00:05:41.190> knife<00:05:41.400> for<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.909> arm<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:43.580> has<00:05:44.580> a

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
good knife for you arm it has a

good knife for you arm it has a
obviously<00:05:45.539> a<00:05:45.570> lanyard<00:05:45.870> hole<00:05:46.139> and<00:05:46.409> it<00:05:46.530> will<00:05:46.740> fit

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
obviously a lanyard hole and it will fit

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.390 
obviously a lanyard hole and it will fit
on<00:05:47.389> gutted<00:05:48.800> paracord<00:05:49.800> through<00:05:49.919> there<00:05:50.250> which

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
on gutted paracord through there which

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.149 
on gutted paracord through there which
is<00:05:50.430> always<00:05:50.789> pretty<00:05:51.120> nice<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.860> all<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:52.889> know

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
is always pretty nice and all I know

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.129 
is always pretty nice and all I know
it's<00:05:53.550> a<00:05:53.610> very<00:05:53.789> nice<00:05:54.000> knife<00:05:54.300> now<00:05:54.690> by<00:05:54.960> way<00:05:55.110> of

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
it's a very nice knife now by way of

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.620 
it's a very nice knife now by way of
comparison<00:05:55.380> I<00:05:56.009> have<00:05:56.430> my<00:05:56.880> spyderco<00:05:57.509> tenacious

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
comparison I have my spyderco tenacious

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.260 
comparison I have my spyderco tenacious
here<00:05:58.340> because<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.460> figured<00:05:59.520> out<00:05:59.969> you<00:06:00.150> know<00:06:00.240> a

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
here because I figured out you know a

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.879 
here because I figured out you know a
lot<00:06:00.479> of<00:06:00.509> people<00:06:00.599> know<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.229> size<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.830> weight

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
lot of people know the size and weight

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.409 
lot of people know the size and weight
and<00:06:02.190> all<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.550> dimensions<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.389> this

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
and all that dimensions on this

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.730 
and all that dimensions on this
tenacious<00:06:03.719> so<00:06:04.110> this<00:06:04.229> would<00:06:04.380> be<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.530> good

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
tenacious so this would be a good

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.129 
tenacious so this would be a good
comparison<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:05.669> again<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.389> handle

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
comparison and again the the handle

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.600 
comparison and again the the handle
material<00:06:07.320> kind<00:06:07.710> of<00:06:07.830> feels<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.219> same<00:06:08.370> on<00:06:08.430> both

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
material kind of feels the same on both

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.330 
material kind of feels the same on both
of<00:06:08.820> these<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.360> there<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.199> go<00:06:10.229> it's<00:06:11.190> almost

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
of these so there you go it's almost

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.270 
of these so there you go it's almost
almost<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.210> same<00:06:12.389> sizes<00:06:12.810> of<00:06:12.930> tenacious<00:06:13.280> here

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
almost the same sizes of tenacious here

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.310 
almost the same sizes of tenacious here
you<00:06:14.370> go<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:15.509> you<00:06:15.599> guys<00:06:15.719> can<00:06:15.870> see<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.139> blade

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
you go so you guys can see the blade

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.860 
you go so you guys can see the blade
stock<00:06:17.270> tenacious<00:06:18.270> blade<00:06:18.479> is<00:06:18.570> going<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.750> be<00:06:18.840> a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
stock tenacious blade is going to be a

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.290 
stock tenacious blade is going to be a
little<00:06:19.139> thicker<00:06:19.440> but<00:06:20.219> as<00:06:20.340> far<00:06:20.520> as<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.849> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
little thicker but as far as the the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.089 
little thicker but as far as the the
width<00:06:21.509> of<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.960> handles<00:06:22.320> themselves<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:22.949> is

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
width of the handles themselves it is

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.279 
width of the handles themselves it is
very<00:06:23.340> very<00:06:23.460> similar<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:24.090> it's<00:06:24.870> always<00:06:25.080> good<00:06:25.259> to

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
very very similar so it's always good to

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.230 
very very similar so it's always good to
point<00:06:25.530> out<00:06:25.710> now<00:06:25.889> one<00:06:26.520> thing<00:06:26.699> that<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:26.909> do<00:06:26.969> want

point out now one thing that I do want

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.490 
point out now one thing that I do want
to<00:06:27.270> say<00:06:27.330> about<00:06:27.539> this<00:06:27.870> is<00:06:28.139> I<00:06:28.979> would<00:06:29.460> probably

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
to say about this is I would probably

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.610 
to say about this is I would probably
not<00:06:31.500> purchase<00:06:32.070> this<00:06:32.219> knife<00:06:32.430> again<00:06:32.789> and<00:06:33.620> you

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
not purchase this knife again and you

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.810 
not purchase this knife again and you
know<00:06:34.740> again<00:06:34.919> this<00:06:35.130> is<00:06:35.310> from<00:06:35.520> initial

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
know again this is from initial

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.459 
know again this is from initial
impressions<00:06:36.389> and<00:06:36.630> the<00:06:36.750> reason<00:06:37.020> for<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.349> is

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
impressions and the reason for it is

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.800 
impressions and the reason for it is
because<00:06:37.800> I<00:06:38.099> picked<00:06:38.849> it<00:06:38.969> up<00:06:39.060> because<00:06:39.330> i<00:06:39.449> love

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
because I picked it up because i love

Maxpedition gear
and<00:06:41.100> I<00:06:41.400> figured<00:06:41.730> you<00:06:41.820> know<00:06:41.910> this<00:06:42.030> is<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.210> first

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
and I figured you know this is the first

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.390 
and I figured you know this is the first
knife<00:06:42.660> from<00:06:42.870> them<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.620> if<00:06:43.830> you<00:06:43.860> want<00:06:44.190> it<00:06:44.370> for

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
knife from them so if you want it for

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.160 
knife from them so if you want it for
the<00:06:44.910> you<00:06:45.480> know<00:06:45.570> just<00:06:45.780> kind<00:06:45.990> of<00:06:46.020> like

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
the you know just kind of like

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.170 
the you know just kind of like
collectability<00:06:46.980> purposes<00:06:47.460> or<00:06:47.760> just<00:06:48.090> a

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
collectability purposes or just a

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.150 
collectability purposes or just a
novelty<00:06:48.510> factor<00:06:48.840> definitely<00:06:49.770> go<00:06:49.830> ahead<00:06:50.040> and

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160

money again the tenacious is one of

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.630 
money again the tenacious is one of
those<00:07:00.930> choices<00:07:01.200> that<00:07:01.980> I<00:07:02.040> would<00:07:02.220> probably<00:07:02.370> end

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
those choices that I would probably end

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.460 
those choices that I would probably end
up<00:07:02.760> going<00:07:02.820> with<00:07:03.150> something<00:07:03.420> like<00:07:03.540> that<00:07:03.720> maybe

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
up going with something like that maybe

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.380 
up going with something like that maybe
that<00:07:04.770> has<00:07:04.950> a<00:07:04.980> little<00:07:05.250> bit<00:07:05.370> more<00:07:05.520> of<00:07:05.820> you<00:07:06.270> know

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390

bit more bells and whistles i think if

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.170 
bit more bells and whistles i think if
they<00:07:37.110> would<00:07:37.290> have<00:07:37.320> maybe<00:07:37.560> added<00:07:38.100> a<00:07:38.250> spring

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180

they would have maybe added a spring
assist<00:07:39.510> to<00:07:39.630> this<00:07:39.810> i<00:07:40.680> think<00:07:41.520> it<00:07:41.670> would<00:07:41.790> have

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
assist to this i think it would have

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.400 
assist to this i think it would have
made<00:07:42.300> it<00:07:42.450> a<00:07:42.540> little<00:07:42.660> bit<00:07:42.840> more<00:07:42.960> appealing<00:07:43.230> in

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.410 
made it a little bit more appealing in

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.920 
made it a little bit more appealing in
my<00:07:43.590> taste<00:07:43.920> but<00:07:44.280> for<00:07:45.060> the<00:07:45.120> most<00:07:45.300> part<00:07:45.420> it's<00:07:45.810> a

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930 
my taste but for the most part it's a

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.240 
my taste but for the most part it's a
pretty<00:07:46.110> nice<00:07:46.290> knife<00:07:46.320> and<00:07:46.830> a<00:07:46.890> nice<00:07:47.070> little
