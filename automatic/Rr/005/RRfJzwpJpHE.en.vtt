I<00:01:26.340> remember<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.900> Jarvis<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.080> asked<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> make

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I remember that Jarvis was asked to make

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270 
I remember that Jarvis was asked to make
sets<00:01:29.119> minifigures<00:01:30.650> not<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.799> many<00:01:32.009> figures

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
sets minifigures not make many figures

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.289 
sets minifigures not make many figures
make<00:01:32.610> suits<00:01:34.340> which<00:01:35.340> he<00:01:35.549> he<00:01:35.909> could<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
make suits which he he could then just

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940 
make suits which he he could then just
leave<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:36.840> made<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.650> thought<00:01:37.829> I'd<00:01:37.920> make

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
leave and get made so I thought I'd make

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.230 
leave and get made so I thought I'd make
this<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.369> production<00:01:38.640> line<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.090> which

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.590 
this little production line up which
will<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.659> corner<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
will go in one corner of the the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.560 
will go in one corner of the the
basement<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.790> I'll<00:01:44.790> show<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> rest<00:01:45.390> once

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
of technical pieces which are jointed

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.870 
of technical pieces which are jointed
and<00:05:07.430> that's--it's<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:09.230> can<00:05:10.230> fill<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.530> in<00:05:10.880> like

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
and that's--it's I can fill it in like

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.800 
and that's--it's I can fill it in like
that<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:16.070> then<00:05:17.070> all<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.280> need<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.520> do<00:05:17.700> and<00:05:18.660> got

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
that and then all you need to do and got

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.470 
that and then all you need to do and got
the<00:05:18.900> bar<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.290> sits<00:05:19.470> across<00:05:19.650> there<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:21.300> claw

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
the bar that sits across there the claw

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.980 
the bar that sits across there the claw
is<00:05:21.630> going<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.840> sit<00:05:22.940> inside<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.270> if<00:05:24.480> I<00:05:24.660> twist

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
is going to sit inside that if I twist

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.270 
is going to sit inside that if I twist
it<00:05:25.200> round<00:05:25.350> so<00:05:26.280> it's<00:05:26.400> like<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.700> actually<00:05:31.280> so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
it round so it's like that actually so

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.460 
it round so it's like that actually so
that's<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:32.610> arm<00:05:32.870> now<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.080> other<00:05:34.170> arm<00:05:34.410> I

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
that's one arm now for the other arm I

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.550 
that's one arm now for the other arm I
went<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.770> bit<00:05:34.920> different<00:05:35.400> again<00:05:36.330> had<00:05:37.170> a<00:05:37.200> spare<00:05:37.530> a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
went a bit different again had a spare a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.330 
went a bit different again had a spare a
bit<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.710> sticker<00:05:38.070> which<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.370> stuck<00:05:38.580> round<00:05:38.820> to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
bit of sticker which I stuck round to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.390 
bit of sticker which I stuck round to
denote<00:05:41.900> like<00:05:42.900> it's<00:05:43.080> where<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.800> fire<00:05:44.100> comes

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
denote like it's where the fire comes

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.880 
denote like it's where the fire comes
out<00:05:44.640> of<00:05:44.760> his<00:05:44.880> arm<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:45.930> have<00:05:46.110> actually<00:05:46.410> put<00:05:46.650> a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
out of his arm and I have actually put a

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.710 
out of his arm and I have actually put a
flame<00:05:47.550> piece<00:05:47.820> on<00:05:48.000> but<00:05:48.180> that<00:05:48.270> was<00:05:48.330> an<00:05:48.450> extra

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
flame piece on but that was an extra

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.840 
flame piece on but that was an extra
piece<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:49.050> decided<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.470> do<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:50.490> doesn't<00:05:50.730> really

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
piece I decided to do it doesn't really

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.140 
piece I decided to do it doesn't really
fit<00:05:51.950> because<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.160> arm<00:05:53.310> can't<00:05:53.580> lift<00:05:53.730> up<00:05:53.940> very

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
fit because the arm can't lift up very

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.620 
fit because the arm can't lift up very
well<00:05:55.190> but<00:05:56.190> that's<00:05:56.280> an<00:05:56.790> additional<00:05:57.300> piece<00:05:57.480> so

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
well but that's an additional piece so

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.390 
well but that's an additional piece so
you<00:05:57.660> can<00:05:57.900> take<00:05:58.230> that<00:05:58.260> off<00:05:58.410> in<00:05:58.830> fact<00:05:59.070> I'm<00:05:59.220> going

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
you can take that off in fact I'm going

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.990 
you can take that off in fact I'm going

yourself<00:07:08.080> a<00:07:08.460> mark<00:07:09.460> one<00:07:09.699> minifigure

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
yourself a mark one minifigure

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.430 
yourself a mark one minifigure
so<00:07:11.440> put<00:07:11.680> that<00:07:11.830> alongside<00:07:12.810> any<00:07:13.810> of<00:07:14.110> the<00:07:14.229> LEGO
