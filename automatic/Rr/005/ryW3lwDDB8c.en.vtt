 Dr 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hello in this way I would like to show you a way how you feel 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.289
 can hardly provide access to any user in the event of 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.270
 Cases the presidential spokesman forgot password 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.650
 or that you have to help someone she forgot "If you have it here 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 with the program Challenge TNC PDF Patcher corresponding password 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.839
 that's been shown to be a strict norm in others as healthy as his professional debut 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.969
 here is just another variant right say that here too under Windows 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.240
 XP first dive the corresponding software 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.640
 and City Mission provide standard browsers and navigate to them 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.710
 http // dpaq 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 Double / h 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.870
 www point sweet 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.540
 RS 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 CD point 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.830
 System Rescue CD 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 but download now 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.580
 Companies also come with the corresponding versions depending on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 which 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.240
 Calculator they have I have here now 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 this version for the xte 86er PC documents this is of course in the end 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.610
 an iso-file in which one must burn normally on a cd-rom or DVD 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.270
 we have already shown 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.430
 how we can draw a normal image on a usb-stick next to it 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.040
 if you prefer burning on the usb-stick 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.820
 or Copy and then plug in the stick with us is the whole now 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 you look 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.270
 in civilian on older 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 create Explorer 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
 strengthen the CDU is supposed to how is it about dispute 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.230
 Rescue 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.620
 CD 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.440
 the count in the students reasons is of course password protected 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.390
 Semper video 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.690
 Computer administrators password protected the common Matt Damon 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.150
 I'll finish the procedure soon Bern will not be a password anymore 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.879
 be negotiate 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 So restart the computer 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 if I now have the appropriate drive 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 Press Enter 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.419
 shortly thereafter, he is asked to set the first goal layout Germany is 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.419
 the MA 10 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.569
 shortly thereafter, the command prompt appears and in 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.179
 Case to come here already the hint what we have to do to get around 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.039
 you write access 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 to get on our NTFS hard drive 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:19.229
 a dfs- - 3g other the FCA is the 1 and just under Windows 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.639
 So types which is simply recommend to all - 3 g 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.209
 Str 1 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.130
 Mount 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.029
 for Windows 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.489
 Way no fever has kept which also works wonderfully 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.859
 that means take care now 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:47.319
 Mount Windows Klein written by here on the Bay now quite normal on ours 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.799
 Hard disk structure of the Windows hard disk that is 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.849
 because defending to ten would be next 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.569
 Enter Windows 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.569
 thanks system 32 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.879
 conflict 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.889
 So again all Maunz in Windows 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.500
 - is uppercase and lowercase is important because of that 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.499
 that does not work 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.639
 Windows is capitalized on my hard drive and I have it here 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.489
 above only the first letter 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.949
 big ones rise up 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.949
 again CD 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.169
 Windows 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.379
 CD 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.379
 System 32 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.720
 There is not much written that synonymous completely big 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.820
 this comes the small steps 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.590
 mka CD System 32 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.590
 CW conflict 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.490
 Shortened we are in the conflict directory and here we have to go now 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.930
 an ece-center part you see 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 the at the here too 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.810
 both the corresponding program Orpheus Marcell unwinds w 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.879
 PD 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.960
 - l these parameters at all 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.389
 Cacau 1 to let lists so that is XL 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.909
 to display the file 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.749
 already together and we are here now 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.129
 which Konz all 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.259
 available 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.050
 and have among others 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.629
 we could video ourselves here now have more - so it is written 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.509
 that it wrote a large picture that Faubel wrote so great is Nordmann 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.699
 Äcker and and of course that is complete 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.139
 No no password would be then you would also this appropriate 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.139
 Blenk are in the end about the whole effort so not to be 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.050
 so next 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.400
 Chang Stentzel 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.500
 PD 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.720
 - 2 for users 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.750
 and now the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.750
 chew Lammert Sendker with video 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.969
 and he should be showing this one time 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.040
 Press enter so next we get some information 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.419
 for example 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.740
 became the Lock beekeeper and 932 times 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.509
 on the quota itself on the system 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.819
 holed the password never expires from the last the locomotive in the Neckar and has 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.539
 probably failed 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.440
 not really that important 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.029
 importantly informed 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.180
 User incapacitation whose 1 enter 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.749
 especially the ones you choose 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.039
 Dan Hörsching we want the existing password but you can also 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.990
 edit or set new ones 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.520
 However, it is careful behind in XP and Vista 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.060
 Caution is of course always important and is now no reason why you 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.169
 should give new password 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.900
 in my opinion it is much cleverer what happened is easy 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.550
 completely remove to St 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.490
 and if I can then go back to mine 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.379
 Now simply set a new password Bern 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:55.869
 Kander also does not happen 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:58.869
 all towels of 1 one 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.719
 Password deleted 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.860
 the whole thing should now be saved 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.499
 Of course 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:11.979
 okay files or saved the wars so the man negotiate reboot 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:16.809
 Walter computer restarted 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.480
 so again from the log-in Syria kicker now just 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:34.569
 rise up 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.919
 comes accordingly and they see 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.340
 Windows XP will load it directly without having to enter a password 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.910
 So let's be sure that it's very easy to get access to it 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.870
 so far as this should provide 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.379
 SystemRescueCd ESC 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.339
 not missing in her collection and on her usb-stick
