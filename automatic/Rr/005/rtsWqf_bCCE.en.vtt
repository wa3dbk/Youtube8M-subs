00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.210
 of use 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.920
 gives a temperature of two thousand nine hundred 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 eighty degrees celsius is not afraid 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.740
 getting wet

 including 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.820
 boomers have labor and so on a lot 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.580
 listed but due to the fact that we 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.760
 we have fewer 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:34.170
 materials will naturally experience 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:36.210
 only on labor and toilet paper for 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.149
 what we say to confirm 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.789
 opportunity 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:47.240
 him arsonists those materials work was 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.280
 pre - prepared 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 there is about this video link to this video 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.710
 will be given under this video work 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.579
 is a flaxen rope 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.070
 soaked with liquid paraffin we 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:11.240
 prepared now here fluffed for 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:14.220
 that she had such a view that 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.850
 let's say the destroyed form and obviously will 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.150
 easier 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.200
 for the sheep and here's the mora knife itself 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.610
 snort that we take out of its sheath and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.070
 his shoes are made with sharp edges for 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.430
 order to work with fire 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.830
 that is, the names of the edges of the butt flock 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.630
 the sparks I get taken out 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.730
 like the end of a pen 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.850
 since in the vehicle seeing new 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.790
 Flint coated with a protective coating need 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.280
 lightly remove this cover then 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.400
 there is a scrape let's say paint 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.970
 which is covered it is visible now on 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.730
 screen that strip cleared that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.120
 which shine appeared not all of them 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.500
 represent rod 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.510
 covered with black protective layer here 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 Now a high place to work and see with 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:25.080
 the first time with one spark 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.000
 the work we have caught fire that is probably something 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.730
 characteristic which is presented in 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 passport about what the temperature was looking for 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.270
 two thousand nine hundred eighty 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 degrees celsius is fully confirmed 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.500
 because we saw not that friction 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:44.170
 corruption itself labor which 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.770
 caught fire now we will use 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.850
 gray plain toilet paper also 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.850
 try to set it on fire 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.350
 one flash one spark before dressing 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.700
 the paper also lights up but how does it not 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.200
 lights up the flame it starts to glow 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.960
 here you can see by the smoke went loop that is 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.280
 it turns out that if you wish, already 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:25.040
 with such paper and country you can 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:27.770
 dilute the role it turns out that for those 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.630
 characteristics which are presented in 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.950
 passport that's my lights installed 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.900
 place the burden put the sheath and those 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.510
 characteristics which are specified in 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.090
 passport that it is possible to incinerate 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.460
 paper by labor and other materials 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.660
 but unfortunately for the materials that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.190
 there is availability we have confirmed for today 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.190
 all bye bye
