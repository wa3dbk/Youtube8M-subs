00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.700 

just<00:01:20.280> keep<00:01:20.640> mixing<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.590> flip

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
just keep mixing you can you know flip

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.350 
just keep mixing you can you know flip
attend<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.829> cooking<00:01:26.220> something

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.260 

I<00:01:30.100> don't<00:01:31.100> know<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.610> don't<00:01:31.820> know<00:01:31.910> how<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.120> going

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
I don't know I don't know how I'm going

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.760 
I don't know I don't know how I'm going
to<00:01:32.330> hold<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.600> camera<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.170> show<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.440> how<00:01:33.530> do<00:01:33.650> I

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
to hold the camera and show you how do I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.350 
to hold the camera and show you how do I
apply<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.190> but<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:36.080> basically<00:01:36.440> want<00:01:36.770> to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
apply this but you basically want to

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.910 
apply this but you basically want to
apply<00:01:38.860> bigger<00:01:39.860> than<00:01:40.100> what<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.430> dent<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.920> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
apply bigger than what the dent is on a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.440 
apply bigger than what the dent is on a
flat<00:01:43.610> spreader<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:46.610> way<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.150> apply

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
flat spreader so that way you can apply

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.030 
flat spreader so that way you can apply
pressure<00:01:47.750> while<00:01:48.080> applying<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.950> can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
pressure while applying it so you can

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480 
pressure while applying it so you can
take<00:01:49.190> off<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.340> excess<00:01:49.850> or<00:01:50.120> excess<00:01:51.490> leftover

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
take off the excess or excess leftover

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.670 
take off the excess or excess leftover
bondo<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.630> don't<00:01:53.960> have<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.229> have<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.410> hard

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
bondo so you don't have to have a hard

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.760 
bondo so you don't have to have a hard
time<00:01:55.240> sanding<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.360> once<00:01:56.660> everything's<00:01:57.440> all

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
time sanding it once everything's all
