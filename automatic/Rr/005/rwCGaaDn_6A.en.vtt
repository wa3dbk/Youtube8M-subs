00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.800
 the keys 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:13.880
 because he 's tired of this happening to you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.880
 we have the solution 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.600
 now I can focus more on the game and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 less in magic to avoid the 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 hits 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.670
 and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.550
 Mr. github because the bits are good 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.130
 to improve the gameplay good sir 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 for the tri I will not explain safely the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.950
 first point of why we must provide 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.949
 is that you can focus more on the game 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.629
 and less in clicks being clicker 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.210
 you focus too much on your bar 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.570
 spells and that makes you have a game 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 slow and inaccurate also improves your 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.100
 ability to react to events 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.040
 unexpected and therefore you have greater 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.410
 quickly on the other hand you have a game 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.270
 cleaner on the outside people see you 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.200
 play like prettier faster more 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.479
 subtle and finally the ability to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.820
 launch fast spell sequences 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.360
 being clicker you have to go one after 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.060
 another however being binder like the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 you have all in the palms of your hands 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 you can do it fast and concise 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.909
 and how are we going to look good there are two methods 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.670
 the first one is the method to 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.310
 typical spending that is through the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.829
 keyboard we 're going to go to the buttons 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.350
 action of each bar and configure the 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.179
 key that we want and the method that I'm going to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.189
 explain myself is through the add-on 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.850
 domino's that I'll put it in the box 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.969
 description of the video well once 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.700
 downloaded the domino's we have for 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.920
 configure the bars simply 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 by clicking on the button quoted from the mini 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.209
 map where asthma or we see the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.429
 we configure with the right click or as 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.280
 we want the big ones the little ones that 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.640
 be 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.230
 and now we go to the important bin of ar 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.890
 to sell you simply have to do 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.720
 shift click on the domino and we will enter 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.670
 the vending move as well says here 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.490
 character keyboard this key 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.770
 means that for example I with my 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.090
 druid I have some jeans and with my shaman 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.100
 I have other bits 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.560
 they are not the same keys so I'm going to 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.400
 put the character keyboard yes but if 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 you remove this aesthetic you are going to have the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 same bits on the same keys with 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.100
 all the characters is to say if I in 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 the action bar 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.230
 first I put in the button first the r 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.120
 in all my characters will be in the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.620
 button first the r instead if I put 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.590
 keyboard the character each character 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.770
 will have the salary that he chooses well 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.870
 then once entered here we go to 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.180
 put the pins that we want those that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.850
 we are more subscribe I will recommend 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.920
 start with a few vince if you are clicker 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.010
 starts with a few bits and the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.840
 important skills because if you do not 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.610
 you are going to put many you are not going to learn you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.430
 you're going to click again 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.700
 so first important things for 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.990
 example with the druid I would recommend 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.740
 well gut fierce and amputate 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.890
 for example start with things like that I 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.640
 I have in 1 2 3 4 5 6 as you can see 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.380
 these skills and to not have to 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.150
 click as I put these skills 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.340
 molding wild braceros fluid etcetera 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.370
 what keys are we going to use then 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.140
 generally those close to us 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.880
 fingers 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.330
 using 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.480
 the keys to move is to say the tail the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:07.540
 air the efe the zeta x makes clear the more 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.700
 close to use them with the corners 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:16.480
 most important for example, yes, yes 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.850
 if the r if being a shaman have been 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.430
 dead or on another key the download of 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.100
 lightning because it's life 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.740
 aerial in life where you can access well 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.410
 and things granted for example the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.960
 cravings be dead the keys more 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.710
 far away and thus you will not give them 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.910
 English 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.030
 and then another point is to provide with shift 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.930
 or alt or control with that you can have 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.930
 many more buttons 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.870
 and not have to stretch your hand until you 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.139
 alps to hit the button so you can 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.900
 make cheesy 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.630
 against that 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.910
 to your liking I only use shift 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.160
 I usually have some with alt but 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.720
 few 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.780
 and good 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.530
 that would be the video condÃ³minos 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.120
 and the basics and then a curiosity 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.800
 it's also that with the domino you can 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.700
 hide the beats and two macros this way 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.060
 much cleaner than it is how I wear it 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.030
 but good at the beginning to put them 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.370
 visible to go remembering the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.320
 unforgettable 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.440
 for those who do not want to use the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.320
 domino is this the way 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.990
 that provides blizzard that is through the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.220
 keyboard and it's also very simple though 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.230
 a little heavier for me 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.240
 and we're going to go to bar functions 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.170
 action and as you can see we have here 1 2 3 4 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.040
 5 6 7 etc. these would be these 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.260
 buttons 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.860
 action button 1 to the button 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:04.100
 action 12 are these buttons then we 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.820
 we will go below and we have here that 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:11.830
 lower left action button 1 a 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.830
 12 what would these be from there 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.449
 the right would be the continuation until 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:19.909
 the silver hippogriff 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.139
 and finally we have these two that are 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:28.219
 the right reaction 1 is this and the 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.770
 right reaction 2 what is this and good 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:33.409
 it's as simple as that you click and 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.239
 put the key that you want 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.759
 Finally, emphasize what was already 

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:39.889
 said before started with very few 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.709
 vince because if you're not going to mess up and 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.449
 dizzy and that they are of the styles that more 

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:47.180
 6 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:51.620
 and that are important if you are a druid 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.289
 Feral and we get the keys to 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.729
 example the wild roar for what 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.110
 first that you must provide is the 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.490
 wild roar 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.819
 then little by little when it 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.719
 you will end up providing the 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.219
 drinks and even the mounts that are 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.319
 unnecessary things but good is that 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:12.710
 as the end already do not click anything 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:15.379
 it is even more comfortable you good 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.879
 I encourage everyone in cha also encourages us to 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:18.879
 that I will say it now 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:29.250
 so come 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.250
 we say goodbye to you maybe 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.949
 Pepito 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:37.110
 thanks to the wine now I can focus 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:42.409
 more to run like a whore and heal me 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.409
 since that bastard or god hits me 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.919
 Mr 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.919
 why 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.250
 for that, wait a moment 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.780
 Sir hip hop but because my 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.100
 character 

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.100
 I will be raised
