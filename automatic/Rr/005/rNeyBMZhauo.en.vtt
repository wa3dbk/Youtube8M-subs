00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
been a lottery but the way that we've

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.639 
been a lottery but the way that we've
gone<00:00:26.669> out<00:00:26.819> this<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.329> me<00:00:28.169> feels<00:00:28.470> very

unjust and a bit of a disgrace really
the<00:00:30.689> overriding<00:00:31.169> feeling<00:00:31.380> seems<00:00:31.739> to<00:00:31.919> be<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the overriding feeling seems to be that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
the overriding feeling seems to be that
of<00:00:32.369> Ireland's<00:00:32.700> won<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> game<00:00:33.120> 1<00:00:33.300> nil<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.809> went

through extra time it went to penalties

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
through extra time it went to penalties
and<00:00:35.789> Ireland<00:00:36.090> lost<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.539> something<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.559> could

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and Ireland lost as something you could

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.259 
and Ireland lost as something you could
take<00:00:37.859> in<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.039> chin<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.609> is<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.000> different

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269
