we're going to get into it and yeah this

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.870 
we're going to get into it and yeah this
method<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.809> I've<00:00:34.140> used<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
method is I've used it a little and it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.810 
method is I've used it a little and it's
been<00:00:36.030> working<00:00:36.360> quite<00:00:36.510> well<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:37.590> I'll<00:00:38.579> show

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
been working quite well with I'll show

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
been working quite well with I'll show
you<00:00:39.030> basically<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.690> straight<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> he

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you basically get straight into it he

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
you basically get straight into it he
can<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.760> bronze<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> silver<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can do we got bronze and silver but this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
can do we got bronze and silver but this
is<00:00:43.260> hardly<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.120> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is hardly any up if you do it with this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
is hardly any up if you do it with this
one<00:00:45.270> there's<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:45.899> chance<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.350> deals

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
one there's more chance of going deals

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
one there's more chance of going deals
so<00:00:46.890> basically<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.149> dual<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> general

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so basically you can dual the general

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
so basically you can dual the general
one<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> everyone<00:00:49.770> thinks<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> 12<00:00:50.489> free

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
one that everyone thinks the 12 free

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
one that everyone thinks the 12 free
method<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.649> does

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
method is it can be this one does

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
method is it can be this one does
technically<00:00:53.280> work<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.660> do

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
technically work because what it will do

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.410 
technically work because what it will do
it<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:56.160> find<00:00:56.670> deals<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.210> between

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it all like find deals are between

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.630 
it all like find deals are between
between<00:00:57.870> 12<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.590> people<00:00:58.949> list<00:00:59.160> sometimes

other ones you can do this one also
works<00:01:38.040> quite<00:01:38.369> well<00:01:39.710> 35<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.640> six<00:01:42.180> now

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
works quite well 35 and then six now

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.569 
works quite well 35 and then six now
this<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.960> used<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.130> well<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.430> you

can also change on to warm 56 now 156 is
also<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.729> such<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.299> basically

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
also good one because such as basically

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.039 
also good one because such as basically
a<00:01:52.020> step<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:53.340> sweat<00:01:53.880> perfect<00:01:54.420> lip<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.869> me

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and you can do free to fire but

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
and you can do free to fire but
generally<00:01:58.200> search<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> little<00:01:59.009> bit

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
generally search them out a little bit

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
generally search them out a little bit
more<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.700> hope<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.420> making<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> sense

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
more I hope I'm making a bit of sense

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109 
more I hope I'm making a bit of sense
for<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.829> kinda<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> different

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
for this one it's kinda a different

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.080 
for this one it's kinda a different
method<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.320> add<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.579> tool<00:02:05.820> free

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
method this one add to the one tool free

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
method this one add to the one tool free
the<00:02:06.630> general<00:02:06.990> search<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> better<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.770> get

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the general search is better to get

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.270 
the general search is better to get
deals<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.599> decent<00:02:10.110> idea<00:02:10.739> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

once of 10 15 20 this one certainly does
work<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.820> can<00:03:01.090> basically<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.840> try<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.080> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
work you can basically just try it a

different amounts and they'll gradually

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.110 
different amounts and they'll gradually
work<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> Toria<00:03:06.400> there's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
work like this one is a Toria there's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
work like this one is a Toria there's
not<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.390> many<00:03:07.570> up<00:03:07.870> but<00:03:08.140> sometimes<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.740> can
