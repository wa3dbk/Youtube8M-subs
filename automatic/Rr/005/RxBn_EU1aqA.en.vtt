00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the next 30 seconds or so is basically

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.480 
the next 30 seconds or so is basically
show<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.310> you're

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
show you what not to do what you're

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.870 
show you what not to do what you're
doing<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> watch<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:58.009> there<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.189> obviously

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
doing this watch and there is obviously

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
doing this watch and there is obviously
the<00:02:00.090> slot<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.659> side<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the slot in the side there which you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
the slot in the side there which you
want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.149> makes

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
want to line this up now what makes

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.510 
want to line this up now what makes
these<00:02:03.570> pin<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.170> unique<00:02:04.619> compared<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> pins

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
these pin so unique compared to the pins

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
these pin so unique compared to the pins
that<00:02:05.729> came<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.930> actually

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that came with it is they actually

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
that came with it is they actually
spring<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.979> both<00:02:08.220> sides<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> makes<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
spring on both sides so it makes it a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.720 
spring on both sides so it makes it a
lot<00:02:09.390> easier<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.550> you're

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
lot easier to get this in when you're

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.890 
lot easier to get this in when you're
actually<00:02:11.910> trying<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.629> because<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
actually trying to do it because it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.250 
actually trying to do it because it
gives<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.200> more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
gives you more

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.830 
gives you more
flexibility<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.530> actually<00:02:15.980> push<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.430> together

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
flexibility to actually push it together

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.420 
flexibility to actually push it together
get<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.079> between<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.470> slots<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.189> will

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
get it in between the slots so it will

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670 
get it in between the slots so it will
line<00:02:19.700> up<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.090> then<00:02:20.180> pinch<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.720> place<00:02:20.930> so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
line up and then pinch in the place so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.160 
line up and then pinch in the place so
as<00:02:22.189> I<00:02:22.790> decided<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> try<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.540> do<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.019> my

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
as I decided to try to do this with my

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.080 
as I decided to try to do this with my
fingers<00:02:24.560> only<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.069> realize<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.579> know<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
fingers only to realize you know what a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.330 
fingers only to realize you know what a
screwdriver<00:02:26.870> would<00:02:27.349> be<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> much<00:02:27.890> better<00:02:28.099> way

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
screwdriver would be a much better way

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780 
screwdriver would be a much better way
to<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.579> this<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.560> after<00:02:30.560> realizing<00:02:31.310> yet<00:02:31.519> again

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
to do this so after realizing yet again

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
to do this so after realizing yet again
maybe<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.299> flat<00:02:32.569> end<00:02:32.810> would<00:02:32.989> probably<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
maybe the flat end would probably be a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.130 
maybe the flat end would probably be a
better<00:02:33.950> way<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.159> do<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.700> decided<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.750> turn<00:02:35.989> it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
better way to do it I decided to turn it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.729 
better way to do it I decided to turn it
on<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.349> flat<00:02:36.590> end<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.060> once<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.269> are<00:02:38.739> lined

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
on the flat end and once you are lined

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.890 
on the flat end and once you are lined
up<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.190> tilt<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.060> watch<00:02:41.269> head<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.629> a<00:02:41.720> little

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
up just tilt the watch head up a little

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.330 
up just tilt the watch head up a little
bit<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.260> give<00:02:42.409> you<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:42.829> of<00:02:42.859> an<00:02:43.010> angle

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
bit to give you a little bit of an angle

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190 
bit to give you a little bit of an angle
and<00:02:43.459> then<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.269> pinch<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.659> in<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:44.989> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and then you can pinch that in there and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.930 
and then you can pinch that in there and
once<00:02:45.439> you<00:02:45.650> actually<00:02:45.799> get<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.640> push<00:02:46.819> it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
once you actually get it in you push it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.910 
once you actually get it in you push it
in<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> rest<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> way<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.810> voila<00:02:48.530> you're

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
in the rest of the way and voila you're

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.949 
in the rest of the way and voila you're
all<00:02:49.040> set<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.150> take<00:02:50.390> your<00:02:50.510> time<00:02:50.720> doing

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
all set up if you take your time doing

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.099 
all set up if you take your time doing
this<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> will<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:52.220> difficult<00:02:52.760> at<00:02:52.909> all<00:02:53.109> of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
this it will not be difficult at all of

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.960 
this it will not be difficult at all of
course<00:02:54.409> if<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.829> sitting<00:02:55.069> with<00:02:55.549> your<00:02:55.700> arms

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
course if you're sitting with your arms

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.910 
course if you're sitting with your arms
wrapped<00:02:56.239> around<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.599> camera<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.319> might<00:02:57.739> be<00:02:57.889> a

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
wrapped around the camera it might be a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.199 
wrapped around the camera it might be a
little<00:02:58.220> bit<00:02:58.310> more<00:02:58.430> difficult<00:02:58.909> to<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.180> that

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
little bit more difficult to do that

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.839 
little bit more difficult to do that
however<00:02:59.810> here's<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.709> band<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.220> finished<00:03:01.639> I'm

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
however here's the band it finished I'm

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.039 
however here's the band it finished I'm
not<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> waste<00:03:02.299> your<00:03:02.480> time<00:03:02.629> do<00:03:02.840> on<00:03:02.959> the

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
not going to waste your time do on the

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.860 
not going to waste your time do on the
other<00:03:03.170> side<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:04.159> looks<00:03:04.220> official<00:03:04.609> as<00:03:05.090> hell<00:03:05.299> it

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
other side it looks official as hell it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.479 
other side it looks official as hell it
looks<00:03:05.930> decent<00:03:06.409> with<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.980> black<00:03:07.220> I'm

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
looks decent with the black I'm

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.190 
looks decent with the black I'm
definitely<00:03:08.120> going<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.269> keep<00:03:08.450> looking<00:03:08.900> for
