retarded<00:03:49.390> bargain<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> there's<00:03:50.170> gotta<00:03:50.560> be

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
retarded bargain and there's gotta be

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.550 
retarded bargain and there's gotta be
little<00:03:51.010> catches<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.560> personally

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
little catches to this but I personally

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.650 
little catches to this but I personally
just<00:03:53.800> don't<00:03:54.040> think<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:55.390> will<00:03:55.630> actually

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
just don't think that this will actually

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.199 
just don't think that this will actually
get<00:03:56.110> approved<00:03:56.230> by<00:03:56.830> airline<00:03:57.280> safety<00:03:57.580> because

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
get approved by airline safety because

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.350 
get approved by airline safety because
you<00:03:59.050> know<00:03:59.170> we<00:03:59.410> do<00:03:59.590> every<00:04:00.340> time<00:04:00.489> we<00:04:00.700> go<00:04:00.850> onto<00:04:01.120> an

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
you know we do every time we go onto an

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.970 
you know we do every time we go onto an
airplane<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.810> do<00:04:01.930> all<00:04:02.050> those<00:04:02.140> safety<00:04:02.590> checks

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
airplane we do all those safety checks

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.009 
airplane we do all those safety checks
do<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.880> know<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.540> buckle<00:04:04.840> your

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
do you know just so you buckle your

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.140 
do you know just so you buckle your
seatbelt<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.769> case<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.040> emergencies<00:04:06.790> or<00:04:07.060> it's

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
seatbelt in case of emergencies or it's

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.699 
seatbelt in case of emergencies or it's
gonna<00:04:07.269> be<00:04:07.390> something<00:04:07.720> under<00:04:07.930> your<00:04:08.050> seat<00:04:08.350> you

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
gonna be something under your seat you

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.340

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
know this and this and this and so I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.640 
know this and this and this and so I
don't<00:04:11.620> think<00:04:12.570> because<00:04:13.570> uh<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:14.200> just<00:04:14.380> don't

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
don't think because uh you just don't

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.270 
don't think because uh you just don't
think<00:04:14.769> it's<00:04:14.950> gonna<00:04:15.340> work<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.049> does

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
think it's gonna work but if it does

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.229 
think it's gonna work but if it does
let's<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.459> honest<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.820> would<00:04:18.940> go<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.150> a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
let's be honest I would go on a

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.760 
let's be honest I would go on a
dollar-fifty<00:04:19.600> flight<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:20.320> fact<00:04:20.530> there's<00:04:20.680> an

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
dollar-fifty flight in fact there's an

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.630 
dollar-fifty flight in fact there's an
airline<00:04:21.070> here<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.430> Canada<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.830> going

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
airline here in Canada and that is going

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.810 
airline here in Canada and that is going
to<00:04:24.700> be<00:04:24.789> offering<00:04:25.210> flights

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
to be offering flights

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.260 
to be offering flights
Montreal<00:04:26.540> or<00:04:26.660> Toronto<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:27.500> Vancouver<00:04:27.680> for<00:04:28.310> $59

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
Montreal or Toronto to Vancouver for $59

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.170 
Montreal or Toronto to Vancouver for $59
now<00:04:29.660> usually<00:04:30.140> they're<00:04:30.320> like<00:04:30.530> $500<00:04:31.310> but<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
now usually they're like $500 but the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.360 
now usually they're like $500 but the
airline<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.630> supposed<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.140> no<00:04:33.370> it's

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
airline is supposed to have no it's

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.130 
airline is supposed to have no it's
called<00:04:34.550> can't<00:04:34.850> fly<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:35.300> supposed<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.020> have

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
called can't fly it's supposed to have

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.900 
called can't fly it's supposed to have
no<00:04:36.610> Stewart's<00:04:37.610> no<00:04:38.150> seats<00:04:39.050> no<00:04:39.410> nothing<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.790> you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
no Stewart's no seats no nothing and you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.180 
no Stewart's no seats no nothing and you
just<00:04:41.110> do<00:04:42.110> your<00:04:42.260> own<00:04:42.320> thing<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.930> also<00:04:45.800> don't

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
just do your own thing so I also don't

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.340 
just do your own thing so I also don't
think<00:04:46.490> that's<00:04:46.670> really<00:04:47.030> gonna<00:04:47.180> take<00:04:47.960> off<00:04:48.140> for

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
think that's really gonna take off for

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.780 
think that's really gonna take off for
some<00:04:48.560> reason<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:48.980> because<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.370> safety

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
some reason just because of the safety

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.110 
some reason just because of the safety
thing<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.890> giving<00:04:51.890> people<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.400> option<00:04:52.910> of

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
thing but giving people that option of

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.870 
thing but giving people that option of
paying<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.810> lot<00:04:54.110> less<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:55.100> get<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.550> where<00:04:55.730> they

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
paying a lot less to get to where they

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.540 
paying a lot less to get to where they
want<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.240> go<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:57.290> having<00:04:57.560> less<00:04:57.890> comfort<00:04:58.370> I

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
want to go and having less comfort I

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.550 
want to go and having less comfort I
think<00:04:59.180> that's<00:04:59.360> pretty<00:04:59.510> cool<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.320> think

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
think that's pretty cool and I think

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.220 
think that's pretty cool and I think
that's<00:05:00.790> you<00:05:01.790> know<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.270> whole<00:05:02.420> option<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.990> cool

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
that's you know the whole option is cool

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.710 
that's you know the whole option is cool
but<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.740> think<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.210> not<00:05:05.420> gonna<00:05:05.540> pass

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
but I think that it's not gonna pass

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.760 
but I think that it's not gonna pass
safety<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:06.440> it's<00:05:06.620> also<00:05:06.770> just<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:09.380> don't<00:05:09.590> know<00:05:09.710> I

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
safety and it's also just I don't know I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.320 
safety and it's also just I don't know I
think<00:05:09.950> it's<00:05:10.160> gonna<00:05:10.310> get<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.460> bad<00:05:10.670> rap<00:05:10.910> after<00:05:11.270> a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
think it's gonna get a bad rap after a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.640 
think it's gonna get a bad rap after a
while<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.480> think<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.780> might<00:05:11.900> work<00:05:11.930> for<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.350> little

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
while I think it might work for a little

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.440 
while I think it might work for a little
bit<00:05:12.800> some<00:05:13.430> people<00:05:13.610> are<00:05:13.700> gonna<00:05:13.790> get<00:05:13.940> excited

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
bit some people are gonna get excited

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.540 
bit some people are gonna get excited
then<00:05:14.870> other<00:05:15.110> people<00:05:15.440> are<00:05:15.530> gonna<00:05:15.650> be<00:05:15.860> like<00:05:16.040> what

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
then other people are gonna be like what

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.150 
then other people are gonna be like what
the<00:05:16.580> fuck<00:05:17.210> was<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.480> that<00:05:17.990> was<00:05:18.140> stupid<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:18.890> just

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
the fuck was that that was stupid I just

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.450 
the fuck was that that was stupid I just
I<00:05:19.490> almost<00:05:20.090> died<00:05:20.420> or<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.050> was<00:05:21.530> really

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
I almost died or I was really

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.520 
I almost died or I was really
uncomfortable<00:05:23.090> or<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.600> just<00:05:23.780> wasn't<00:05:24.080> worth<00:05:24.230> it

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
uncomfortable or it just wasn't worth it

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.380 
uncomfortable or it just wasn't worth it
or<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.980> should<00:05:25.430> have<00:05:25.460> paid<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.760> extra<00:05:26.060> 20<00:05:26.360> bucks

Ryan Air in general is really really

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.070 
Ryan Air in general is really really

and<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:38.440> mean<00:05:39.440> sometimes<00:05:40.070> when<00:05:40.340> you<00:05:40.400> pay<00:05:40.520> $20<00:05:41.120> XR

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
and I mean sometimes when you pay $20 XR

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.800 
and I mean sometimes when you pay $20 XR
for<00:05:41.630> flight<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.680> worth<00:05:42.920> it<00:05:43.190> 20<00:05:44.180> bucks<00:05:44.330> isn't

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810

that<00:05:45.140> much<00:05:45.320> in<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> long<00:05:45.830> run<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.280> mean<00:05:46.490> the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
that much in the long run so I mean the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.180 
that much in the long run so I mean the
difference<00:05:47.030> between<00:05:47.060> dollar<00:05:47.510> 50<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:47.930> 20<00:05:48.740> 150

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
difference between dollar 50 and 20 150

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.370 
difference between dollar 50 and 20 150
is<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.460> that<00:05:49.580> much<00:05:49.850> for<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.390> flight<00:05:50.930> like<00:05:51.170> that

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
is and that much for a flight like that

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.220
