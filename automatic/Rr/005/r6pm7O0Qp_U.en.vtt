00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.459
 hi how are you here I bring you a 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.160
 new figure of one of my collections 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:12.500
 one of my most favorite striptease with 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 Original g1 this comes with its 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.270
 instructions the stickers that I 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 same I hit the power and its box that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.760
 is in acceptable condition 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.860
 the toy itself had never been this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 played that practically the person 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.779
 always had it saved the box was the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.520
 only one who was mistreated this is very 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 hard to get this toy in very 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 good conditions this since it has 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.380
 many parts of these things that are 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.880
 here they do not go to that originally I was 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.130
 I put them so they have a little more 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.410
 of sight I lie but look here 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.329
 they have a switch to turn on a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.610
 little bit above because it has another 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.239
 switch for this back what 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.239
 they are the radars 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.850
 it is highly valued everywhere this 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.490
 walk a little bit above the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.190
 prices here has a little button that 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:11.360
 helps this channel work from this 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.230
 way this cart this piece is very 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.490
 face on ebay goes between 80 and 100 dollars 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.690
 for people who do not have it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.610
 poor of them and for those who have 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.240
 because everything is not taken care of because it is a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.640
 piece that really pieces pretty 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.290
 to lose 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.880
 you put it to this little monkey on this side 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.470
 well let's proceed with the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.310
 transformation I'm not going to put in what 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.299
 is this 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.770
 way to this battle tank you 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.590
 we remove these stones that we are going to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.159
 occupy before you start to disarm the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 figure 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.659
 these connectors give stability to what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.710
 what are the legs so they are not left 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.960
 well falls 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.840
 here also these have a game 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.939
 important because you can connect to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.530
 Master motor on this side of the stands 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.380
 and you can put here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.350
 outlook of the combats in their way 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 ramps so they have sighting and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.459
 because here you have the IPAX for you to put 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.610
 to the helicopters and so be a city 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.830
 not good in itself this leaves the new ones of 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.810
 this way they would be fallen 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.980
 many people then we put 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.280
 or do not know my face that are this we close 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.740
 this here and we close this we change what 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 what is the radar 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.090
 and we put what is this killed there is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 is the function and this missile launcher by 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.120
 this side 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.120
 then from here to move the ramp 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 we take it off we fold this foot 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.180
 inward 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.569
 make sure we do not see the other one that is going 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 in 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.180
 make sure we remove this and this one from here 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.270
 on his side we lower what is this 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.100
 control tower is pretty hard this 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.150
 we download this also that are like 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.750
 they work like my laser and we double this 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.290
 we get these two and there they have this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.340
 the monkey 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.180
 this is the mode 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.290
 it is known as a paro station 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.560
 based on attack or whatever you want to call 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.230
 they notice that in the street this modality already 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.909
 then we remove it to proceed with 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.030
 the following to not serve to be at 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.670
 this side we take away what these are 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.230
 cannons these pieces quotes that we remove 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.239
 here they have another 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:50.540
 function that they do a cannon or also 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.540
 you what a battle tank is 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.959
 you take and then wars this even the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.140
 enthusiasts down here so you do not 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.380
 drag and grab what is this 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.310
 cannon we light them from here 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.520
 and stick in their attempts to 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.660
 feel and ready this is the function of a 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.460
 canon 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.010
 it moves perfectly we can put it 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.769
 here so these parts practically already 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.400
 we are not going to occupy they are put aside 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.220
 not in the triptych mode not the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.440
 occupy then let's do this let's go 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.730
 to lower these parts and close the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.730
 body in this way 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.310
 this we close this part of above for 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.660
 that we turn what is the head 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.660
 it is totally what it is 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.100
 through or what are practically 360 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.420
 degrees 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.310
 from here you put it here to come here and 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.890
 there is what is triptych to me 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.780
 like to take out what is your pistolita open 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.080
 the mouth so you can see the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.910
 missile launchers and put these turrets on 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.860
 this way so they give you a way to 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.289
 attack and will be more aggressive what is 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.159
 critical 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.159
 walking 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.190
 It is a toy that is in excellent 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.740
 terms 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.740
 this 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.190
 I forgot to put it on this one 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.770
 transform into a cart 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.740
 and you put this here this gun 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.280
 alive in what is your chest becomes 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.570
 in part of his chest 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.570
 There you have gentlemen 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.450
 christie with g1 very is a very figure 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.190
 interesting archenemy of metroplex 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.740
 whenever he criticized he was not doing 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.950
 of yours in what was the caricature 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.630
 this metro pressel the only one who could 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.450
 contain and reject any kind of 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.490
 attack uses batteries to which I believe it is 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.230
 a double ay these are the two batteries 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.200
 of type c 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.210
 you can not see them 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.820
 so then I hope that you have 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.260
 liked the review 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.600
 I have a collection of what they are 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.150
 transformers that one I treat all my 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.070
 figures are especially those that one 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.070
 It is the same as what you are reissues 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.620
