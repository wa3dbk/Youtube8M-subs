of sugar and then we have a little bit
of<00:00:45.870> alcohol<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> kill<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
of alcohol that could kind of kill the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.200

bacteria in the rose petals so these are
all<00:00:51.390> washed<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.079> they're<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.800> dry

of sugar right here that I'm gonna mix
in<00:02:03.700> first<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:05.920> plain<00:02:06.220> sugar

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in first and this is just plain sugar

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.020 
in first and this is just plain sugar
I'll<00:02:09.640> put<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.060> little<00:02:10.360> bit<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.630> first<00:02:10.990> and

I'll put in a little bit in first and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.870 
I'll put in a little bit in first and
for<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.060> amount<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.570> sugar<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.260> it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
for the amount of sugar on it's

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.590 
for the amount of sugar on it's
basically<00:02:17.070> about<00:02:18.360> either<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.900> ratio<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:21.600> two

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
basically about either a ratio of two

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.170 
basically about either a ratio of two
twice<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.350> much<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:24.010> um<00:02:24.190> rose<00:02:24.820> petals

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
twice as much as for um rose petals

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.870 
twice as much as for um rose petals
that's<00:02:25.360> sugar<00:02:25.600> or<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:27.070> even<00:02:27.160> do<00:02:27.459> three

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
that's sugar or you can even do three

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's sugar or you can even do three
times<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.390> much<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.770> all<00:02:29.920> depends<00:02:30.310> on

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
times as much it really all depends on

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.210 
times as much it really all depends on
what<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> want<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> use<00:02:31.180> each<00:02:31.750> Jam<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.470> you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
what you want to use each Jam for you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280 
what you want to use each Jam for you
want<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.459> make<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:34.090> sweet<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.780> can

minutes<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.769> we'll<00:04:21.769> come<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.310> put<00:04:22.520> them<00:04:22.700> in

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
minutes and we'll come and put them in

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.210 
minutes and we'll come and put them in
these<00:04:23.120> jars<00:04:23.590> alright<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:24.770> these<00:04:24.920> have<00:04:25.160> been

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
these jars alright so these have been

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.960 
these jars alright so these have been
setting<00:04:25.820> for<00:04:26.120> about<00:04:26.360> 10<00:04:26.600> minutes<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.700> next

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
setting for about 10 minutes and so next

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.490 
setting for about 10 minutes and so next
I<00:04:29.300> am<00:04:29.630> going<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:31.090> clean<00:04:32.090> my<00:04:32.300> jars<00:04:33.050> with<00:04:33.470> a

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
I am going to clean my jars with a

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.890 
I am going to clean my jars with a
little<00:04:33.830> bit<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.040> alcohol<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:35.360> what<00:04:35.690> I'm<00:04:35.810> going

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
little bit of alcohol so what I'm going

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.480 
little bit of alcohol so what I'm going
to<00:04:35.960> do<00:04:36.170> is<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:38.240> pour<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:39.140> tiny<00:04:39.740> little<00:04:40.010> bit<00:04:40.310> in

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
to do is just pour a tiny little bit in

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:52.820 
to do is just pour a tiny little bit in
each<00:04:40.790> jar<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:44.000> rinse<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.810> sides

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:04.189 

ha

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.600 

so<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:05.379> way<00:05:05.679> it<00:05:06.389> probably<00:05:07.389> prevents<00:05:08.289> all<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
so this way it probably prevents all the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:22.119 
so this way it probably prevents all the
bacteria<00:05:10.270> from<00:05:10.479> eating<00:05:10.869> up<00:05:10.989> all<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.169> sugar

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.619 

all<00:05:22.729> right<00:05:22.939> so<00:05:23.919> next<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:25.369> am<00:05:25.429> going<00:05:26.059> to<00:05:26.330> go<00:05:26.599> back

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
all right so next I am going to go back

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.429 
all right so next I am going to go back
in<00:05:26.989> here<00:05:27.550> try<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.610> squeeze<00:05:29.599> all<00:05:29.929> the<00:05:29.959> juices

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439
