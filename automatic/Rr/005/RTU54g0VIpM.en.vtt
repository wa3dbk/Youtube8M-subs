00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.990
 Hello dear audience 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.059
 I am often asked how to do it 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.669
 a echo sounder in a dinghy makes sense 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.530
 applying the main problem is well 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.510
 rather not that on the inflatable 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.560
 It does not work, but that one is in the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.870
 inflatable very cramped 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.130
 has space and I have so 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.750
 something a bit too 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.100
 Tried it when I was fresh in the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.500
 dinghy area and there I am 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.660
 an old black body box taken 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.450
 has the echo sounder screwed on there and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.950
 put the battery in the box for pure 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.230
 with the result that I have one though 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.600
 Echolot, however, was more permanent 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.650
 this year relatively small 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 space conditions since this body box 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.790
 jumped in front of her feet 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.739
 and that was totally annoying 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.120
 then I searched a bit 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.800
 and I thought and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.710
 So it came out that here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.290
 this is my current montage the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.200
 is very simple but highly effective 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.180
 I screw this with my clamp here mine 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.750
 entire echo sound just directly on the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 mirror 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.189
 that is the function but that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 Echolot is completely out of the boat 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.270
 this pinch here that's this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.820
 part here 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 that's an american blog 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.510
 manufacturer that there is a boat clamp where 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.890
 actually a good healer 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.659
 should be screwed on it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.750
 there is this round plate 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.159
 screwed one sees here are 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.229
 holes in it 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.030
 there is this plate screwed on the 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.180
 I needed it as adapter plate with it 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.640
 the actual plate of the echo sounder 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.340
 could mount on this plate with 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.280
 So the whole echo sounder turns like 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.770
 you want it and about the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.439
 You can do it here in the back 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.000
 adjust the angle so that you out there 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.430
 all directions in the boat 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.520
 sitting can be very nice on it 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.840
 I own the echo 200 from Garmin 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.640
 I want to be very satisfied with that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.680
 that has different features such as 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.799
 example settings of the units 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.560
 so foot or meter an illuminated 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.180
 background display because 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.880
 contrast on the display you can 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.829
 set it has a split window and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.310
 also a split frequency that means one 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.539
 can be 77 and or 2 100 kilohertz 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 show 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.920
 the difference is that the 77 um 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.180
 the 200 the cone wider or flatter 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.380
 have the wider cone it is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.599
 of course you can see it 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.790
 what happens next to the boat and a 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.530
 flatterer cone goes in better of course 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.450
 the deep when you really over it now 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.760
 deep water I fish here at the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.920
 western baltic if steve it is only 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.959
 30 meters that's really deep 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.940
 So that makes little sense and there can 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.580
 to choose the wider cone over it 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.650
 The device itself comes in a beautiful 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.840
 packaging with all all what you 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.349
 So there is the encoder with it 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 the whole wireless and I have the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.299
 Capillary as I needed it 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.150
 rightly alienated so he sits here 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.980
 cut through it on the back 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
 stupid because of the various small veins 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.609
 there are I would not now 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.750
 disconnect and these veins all end here 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.820
 in these plugs 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.230
 So if you take the device off synonymous 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.700
 want then you simply have the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.620
 can suppress tongue to the device 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.380
 Take out and there you can see that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 whole contacts are so firmly on it and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.319
 because now the individual start 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.910
 extract 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.859
 I said that I prefer 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.459
 not so we can fold 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.780
 everything ready and so this is screw 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.310
 I just keep that over the top 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 I fix this over the mirror 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 and then the device is outside the boards 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.870
 here below is one 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.579
 aluminum profile in this 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 Aluminum profile, I have the cable to 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.690
 put up and not with the water 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.880
 I injected that too high 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.530
 cut aluminum profile here 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.590
 when you get the water resistance free 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.900
 in between can flow while driving 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.569
 So I have the injection 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 possibility significantly reduces the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.290
 Power is supplied via this cable 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 instead of there I have a 12v 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.889
 made cigarette lighter plug off 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.079
 that comes from the company bals bike parts 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.400
 I have chosen with intention so because 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.209
 a plug is very high 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.000
 quality 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.099
 because you can also for 12 volts 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.629
 standard outlet you have to take 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.550
 take the good part off and then you can 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.310
 that with these 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.120
 as small sockets as many 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.380
 camping vehicles or otherwise boats 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.269
 i have use stream i can get out 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060
 my little so-called power devices 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.480
 funds device this is this white box 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.160
 here 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.740
 this is nothing more than a plastic 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.830
 box is pushed into each other 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.260
 and he looks from above like that 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.850
 I here two sockets should be full 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.010
 sockets are with a fault 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.680
 just kept the lid closed so that the 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.690
 liquid storage on there 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.310
 minimum be reduced 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.810
 the top I have to wear in 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.490
 stainless steel handle and the whole is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.720
 get involved glued together here the tape 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.550
 looks a bit shabby 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.830
 but nothing comes from nothing 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.780
 Loading the current device protection device 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.450
 is also very easy 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.090
 I bought a charger for that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.710
 also from the company baskets that looks like that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.200
 but relatively simple is a whole 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.630
 intelligent part 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.320
 I can show which one 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.750
 pour over this word meter at 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.700
 Loading flows and the end of the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.340
 charger looks and you will 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.250
 already suspect the application 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.970
 So I just open the outlet 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.740
 write the plug in and feel it 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.020
 current in the same way as I him 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.740
 I also picked it up again and you 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.200
 can see 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.770
 So it shows directly to which stream there 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:41.850
 is taken right here too 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.360
 see ok current charge at 80 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.280
 percent 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.900
 now jumps over to green now 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.630
 I know that because the battery is full 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.090
 and then I have the immediately 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.040
 is ok certainty current device-foot falls 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.910
 picks up can be used immediately 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.680
 that is a very comfortable thing 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.260
 So I'm completely equipped 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.620
 and fits that I just imagine 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.410
 boat 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.210
 and I put it where it suits me 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.560
 and there I am completely self - sufficient and 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.140
 I could even do that in some way 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880
 use another boat if you like 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.800
 ask for construction material 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.840
 care or whatever 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.720
 I got stuck when dragging fischer de 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.220
 ordered the stephan masur from the trolling 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.560
 However, that's what I think 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.419
 his shop there you can do that 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.400
 simply order what you know 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.639
 must the profits here in the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.550
 are are holes here and in there 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.669
 not metric but that's inch 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.830
 thread care if your screws are clean 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.930
 screws wanted to screw either inch 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.780
 use or new profits new forum 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.790
 rhine cut well that was it to mine 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.410
 Echo and man electricity devices funds device 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.080
 I'm very happy with that and that 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.190
 works very effectively for me there 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.320
 nothing better 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.730
 maybe there is one or the other in 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.070
 able to recreate that 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.479
 Anyone who has questions write to me 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.470
 or in the comments below this
