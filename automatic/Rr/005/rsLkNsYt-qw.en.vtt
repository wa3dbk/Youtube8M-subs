00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hey i have new workshops from 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 staedtler bought this medienstar 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.160
 muscle ending so much more and much 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 zealously and as you also with these 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 It can now also be used again 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.199
 small since that I show you now 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 just before the cover can 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.250
 one opens here one finds in total the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.939
 file instructions and especially many 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.769
 Creative idea what I can do with it 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.870
 Do you have nice colors ? 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.870
 if I'm just the class to hold 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 judah you know the colors again for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 your knows white yellow and loose so shall 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 a gradient from light yellow to dark 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.870
 red pink arise pick up the first of his 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 paint and teach this fitting 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.400
 to each other 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.800
 They would have to overlap next to each other 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.170
 not yet this arises later 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.620
 when you trigger the mass and always 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 melt down the most important tool 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.670
 here a current or a pasta 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.560
 machine 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.560
 depending on what you have at home 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 Now the work starts off you go with 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.270
 the current you see now the mass 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 apart and then leaves them again 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.079
 while overlapping the colors and it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.759
 the color gradient develops so you get 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.140
 a nice blending came the box idea 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.750
 from staedtler I find a good idea 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 The color gradient is great too, but not 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.500
 absolutely a must 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.149
 You can save the money here by 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 you prefer a neck roll 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.130
 acquires instructions you will find ideas 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.829
 So any amount on the internet buys better 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.630
 make a fimo colors of choice and imagine 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.630
 so its own color gradient 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.740
 The workshops are so bad 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.320
 But then not finally boxing 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.650
 the kaleidoscope is not really one 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.800
 creative box has a lot of potential 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.360
 at the blandin it is small in itself 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.330
 Although three instructions 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.040
 but these are relatively similar to what you want 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.540
 finally, with color gradients 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.170
 do a great job 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.750
 though it shows as 23 or more 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.210
 But mixing colors can be the end effect 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.210
 it is always very similar and the same 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.090
 please do not despair when choosing the color 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.330
 To know a blind requires a lot 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.280
 work time and patience to close 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.360
 such a kaliÃŸ roadway in front of you 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.920
 I think I felt at least 20 100 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.440
 I have the mass already 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.180
 smashed 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.670
 now it is from light to dark yet 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 you rolled a candy you in 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.810
 slice can 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.570
 the duh also graced these and then 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.460
 you can cut it and be proud of it 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.460
 be you with so much work 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.750
