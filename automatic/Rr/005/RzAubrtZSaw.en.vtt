 here in the gums you do not have this 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 possibility

 We also have a good cell phone. 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.120
 most humble is the nokia lumia 625 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.850
 As the 5 megapixel camera led flash 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.070

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.370
 on here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.260
 although nokia take decent 4g photos 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.390
 two have a much better camera much 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.730
 superior in all system requirements 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.910
 we have here 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.850
 the nokia lumia works with windows 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.860
 8.1 mg2 when you get qat 4.4.2 a 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.180
 team if the professional will be very 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.920
 taste 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 if you operating system safe 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.320
 windows android which do you prefer 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.380
 the nokia c6 25 has a great 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.470
 functionality with the same avoiding with 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.300
 far lower because of the simple 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.670
 national sebin optimized by its radius 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.950
 while the two lg do not have to talk 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.170
 he is a great smartphone very fast 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.310
 I had no problems locking with 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.810
 he with nothing 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.340
 you will not regret is 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:59.310
 acquiring it let's do on a test 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:02.730
 night and radio nÃ© 123 already opens much more 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.160
 fast or mg2 but this is also because the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.150
 memory processing is much better is 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.400
 of 2 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.280
 here in the upton fast also a slowness 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.510
 that you want to be disgusted with the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.840
 mobile games outside 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:25.130
 the two are already with 4g the lg g 2 also 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:30.270
 quartet and nokia 625 also think 925 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.760
 is the smartphone that has 4g available 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.520
 more in the market the nokia is 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.940
 launching in 1930, right? 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.380
 already on the pages 1 930 here I think now 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.820
 will overcome but you can find 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.380
 this 925 here even cheaper than the 630 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.280
 by meeting 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.110
 in values that 925 you can 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.280
 find new today a little more 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.260
 difficult but you can find 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.050
 then used new ones and managed to 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.380
 found 450 and 150 while real 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.260
 today 2 for about 1300 and 1700 reais 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.410
 are cell phones of categories 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.530
 different is not incoming another era 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.230
 Top of the line is now over for what? 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.340
 already had gt3 launch is over for 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.889
 a mid range 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.780
 but they are two great smartphones if you 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.100
 either a Jew just does not want to spend too much 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.730
 money time and money to spend 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.669
 you can go easy on 925 and if you want 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.919
 an android and has a little more money 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.960
 to spend can drive two you 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.070
 not going to regret it is a great one but it was 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.440
