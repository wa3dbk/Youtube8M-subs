 we made some spectator areas for 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.110

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.790

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.800
 people who want to record the game and 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.670
 description will be your gamer tax to the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.130
 just like this one on some signs in the in 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.360
 the spa a sorry this map is based 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.530
 in the pc version of the member of the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.600
 capon 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.239
 it's not exactly the same as that version 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.649
 this is based as you see these are 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.449
 spectators who have a rail in the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.180
 which will be easy to transport from 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.489
 corner to corner to observe them 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.880
 contenders this map can be played 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.360
 of couples of up to 8 people or 4 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 Couples 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.040
 ok you can also play a person 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 by island there is no problem is pressed 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.509
 in a few words are 4 players to 8 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
 players to start the game is 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.440
 pretty simple only the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.630
 players have to put a vehicle 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.820
 on a rail and the host is going to activate a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.860
 lever that is on the left side the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990
 which will activate the rail system 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.090
 and he's going to go straight to a little house there 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.610
 they will remain approximately one 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.050
 minute on hold and the doors are going to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.149
 open all at the same time so that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.860
 be unfair and there are no people who have 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.569
 entered before or after they fall block 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.009
 I hope you like this map a lot 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.409
 it took us a long time 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.690
 do it but we liked it quite I hope 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.539
 that you like to download it 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.970

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.409

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.630
