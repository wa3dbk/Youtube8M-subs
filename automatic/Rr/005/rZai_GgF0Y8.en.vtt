00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
so I hope it is compatible with these
type<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> games<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> disc<00:01:19.920> with

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
type of games you also get a disc with

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
type of games you also get a disc with
the<00:01:20.189> gamepad<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the gamepad I think this is for the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070

this is where to choose the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
this is where to choose the
compatibility<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> gamepad<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.710> shows

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.940 
and it is compatible with Windows Vista
as<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.540> let<00:01:48.840> us<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> gamepad

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
as well now let us look at the gamepad

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.660 
as well now let us look at the gamepad
itself

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
itself

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
itself
this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.780> gamepad<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.659> let<00:01:54.659> me<00:01:54.810> try<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this is the gamepad and let me try to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.980 
this is the gamepad and let me try to
zoom<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> better<00:01:56.759> view<00:01:56.990> let

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
zoom so that you get a better view let

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.580 
zoom so that you get a better view let
me<00:01:58.140> press<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.590> buttons<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:59.159> well

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.710 

so<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.740> gamepad<00:02:04.159> looks<00:02:04.540> okay

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
so the gamepad looks okay

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.080 
so the gamepad looks okay
you<00:02:06.320> can't<00:02:06.560> expect<00:02:07.159> much<00:02:07.550> from<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:10.610> gamepad

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
you can't expect much from this gamepad

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.530 
you can't expect much from this gamepad
this<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> gamepad<00:02:12.830> back<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> gamepad

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
this is the gamepad back of the gamepad

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.100 
this is the gamepad back of the gamepad
and<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.920> says<00:02:16.250> USB<00:02:16.760> double<00:02:17.120> vibration<00:02:17.660> gamepad

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
and it says USB double vibration gamepad

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.760 
and it says USB double vibration gamepad
so<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> am<00:02:19.700> thinking<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.290> gamepad

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
so I am thinking of that this gamepad

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.210 
so I am thinking of that this gamepad
would<00:02:22.810> would<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.990> good<00:02:24.290> vibration<00:02:25.040> response

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
would would have good vibration response

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.670 
would would have good vibration response
I<00:02:25.910> will<00:02:26.090> let<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.450> know<00:02:26.480> about<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.260> well

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
I will let you know about that as well

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I will let you know about that as well
and<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:29.510> would<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.380> using<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.830> gamepad<00:02:31.340> with
