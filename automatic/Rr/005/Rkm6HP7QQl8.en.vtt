00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.230
 welcome to pinocchio to turn on the news 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.540
 because of this ventilate fainting it is all possible the limit is 4 minutes 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.810
 his challenge is three and a half minutes under water 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.810
 is the mast on the ceiling nicole 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.189
 but even a little bit 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.619
 another exciting race 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.570
 yes the diver is thereby that there are also very very important and he is going to look 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.710
 how the eyes of but they always to be true how his attitude is under water 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 and if she goes well with a shark and three and a half minutes 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.090
 then there was something to say to you the last words but rarely anything 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.890
 say not reached in the car market 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 I know it doesn't need the money 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.360
 look again carlo if there is a threat of a fine in the four minutes 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.640
 because that is really dangerous 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.940
 so we are just going to have its benefits so that half an hour also post yes 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.970
 the group go ahead 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.730
 meanwhile go 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 hp the time 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.800
 he is a sensation 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.090
 under 10 seconds sign of life 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 no every minute of gates diver and the slap on the shoulder and goes marcel say 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.740
 but it is strange and that he does not if you do not respond 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.070
 it means that she's heart rate has gone too low and that is 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.249
 if that goes so 3 first day the hyperventilation can hit the country 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.770
 this team along almere 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 who read 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.869
 defeat against 80 teaspoon nicolette on the clock have 35 seconds and I have 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.180
 nevertheless the feeling that this is not quite right now I did not take it off 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.729
 this is going on 4 but suppose that's true 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.049
 what is going on to keep the woman trying about the time period when the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.049
 neighbor procurve 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.989
 then you get a second chance, again, he has a second one 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.219
 drain 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.219
 a little earlier year 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.359
 they are all 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.709
 tension is to cut then but now it must also be possible that city 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.399
 kardan 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.909
 every minute the perpetrator shot a tap against the ball at night 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.929
 and then the fast responding must know that they also know 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.730
 see no response then it may be that a heartbeat is too low 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.549
 gone 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.169
 and if so then hyperventilating could not be done like a tram 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.949
 I'm also glad I don't think about it but I sketch TVL that picked up 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.119
 be Dutch 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.649
 wait a moment there is doubt gentlemen are shaken and say no really 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.579
 loud applause the grounds 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.569
 yes 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.519
 I think it's just Jaap Maars himself 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.599
 he has come abroad 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.849
 what goes wrong 9 that the group is very nice 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.829
 the works become 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 it's exciting 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.559
 well i think it is very cool that you have this challenge 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.209
 this 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.209
 Yes that is it 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.760
 mascherano the following years he explained there went this is also part of sport 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.599
 you win you lose 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.389
 I tried that did not work but you are in the program and a 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.430
 each one here 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.480
 stood 18 Jun 2011 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.480
 the sexuality 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.419
 turnhout 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.020
 the last 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.410
 the last words are of course the landscape cannot sleep 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.110
 I am getting a bit stupid for everyone 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.110
 we hope to know by e mail 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:53.949
 vivienne
