00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
position as a CDM and because when he

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550 
position as a CDM and because when he
was<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:14.420> obviously<00:01:15.420> played<00:01:15.659> CDM<00:01:16.110> but

was at an see obviously played CDM but
what<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.040> thinking<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.210> when

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
what I'm thinking is you know when
Roberto<00:01:19.590> Carlos<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.159> his<00:01:20.250> best<00:01:20.490> he<00:01:20.670> was

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
Roberto Carlos was at his best he was

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
Roberto Carlos was at his best he was
playing<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.540> left<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:21.930> roll<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> yeah

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
playing in that left back roll and yeah

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.020 
playing in that left back roll and yeah
basically<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.630> cannot<00:01:25.200> wait<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.430> these

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
