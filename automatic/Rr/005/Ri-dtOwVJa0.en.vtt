00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 a lot of attention in this for you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 do not go to make balls in these 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.790
 turns after I make this turn 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.940
 number four 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.690
 I will show you how we are going to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 continue you knitting and at 5 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 size 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.969
 newborn after being in tissue 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 and I'll start with lap number 4 for 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:09.180
 the size girl ok we will go up with three 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.590
 chains again and here we are going to weave 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.979
 a bar 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.039
 about our relief of the return 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.460
 previous and we will make our relief 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.460
 normal 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:30.840
 then we will do 5 varetas 1 2 3 4 y 5 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.530
 normal without any increase 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.150
 now we will do the one that corresponds to the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.440
 wand in relief and we will do 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.440
 the relief point 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.570
 so you have to continue 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.570
 weaving all over this fourth round 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.850
 newborn 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 altogether we would leave 123456 remembering 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.610
 that the sixth is our relief 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 here I finished my return number 4 of the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:31.069
 newborn size remembering that in the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.370
 last space that we must complete 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.360
 the same thing that we have been doing in each 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.959
 one of the spaces now how are they going to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.299
 continue weaving for newborn 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.299
 they go up with three chains 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 and we will do 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.410
 our normal partners 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.210
 and here what we will do is that we're not going 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 to weave the vareta that goes on d 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.390
 the relief or that I do my two 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.990
 chains my two varetas sorry and I'll 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.630
 make my relief without crochet like 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.870
 we have been doing in the laps 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.480
 above which if they work will 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.400
 be that this one 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.040
 then after the relief this vareta 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.840
 they will always work for us 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.560
 let's work is going to be the one that's going 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.930
 about the relief then you are going to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.930
 start counting one 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 3 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.980
 4 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.600
 5 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.860
 six couples 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:08.180
 I do not make the wand of relief 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.790
 I would normally play 7 varetas but 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.720
 I will not do this then nothing else 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.720
 I make my relief 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.259
 and I continue with the next one like this 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.240
 I must have 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.949
 246 varetas 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:33.630
 between the space between each 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:36.849
 relief and so you have to knit 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.060
 your turns are not going to be increases 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:45.460
 they will always knit 6 double crochet and their 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:50.229
 relief for 9 laps from 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:56.530
 our magic hoop so here is 1 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:05:01.090
 2 3 4 5 and we would subtract 4 more laps 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.659
 to get to 9 and if you do not 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.409
 pleases the length can increase another 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:12.280
 turn more so that it is longer 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:15.460
 our hat but I suggest that what 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.880
 do with 9 laps from the hoop 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.569
 magical and until here the 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.830
 Instructions for the newborn 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.830
 top off your fabric
