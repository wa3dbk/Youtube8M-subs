how to make a new paper offline so let's
go<00:00:08.069> start<00:00:08.970> by<00:00:09.300> folding<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.200> paper<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.920> half

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.889 

also<00:00:27.720> corners<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.560> let<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> same

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
also corners down let this the same

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
also corners down let this the same
thing<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> other<00:00:40.379> side<00:00:54.680> now<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> will

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
thing at the other side now you will

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.619 
thing at the other side now you will
have<00:00:56.219> something<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
have something that looks like this and

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:10.660 
have something that looks like this and
let's<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:05.180> turn<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> paper<00:01:06.630> around<00:01:07.729> and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
let's go on turn the paper around and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.380 
let's go on turn the paper around and
okay<00:01:13.490> fold<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.350> front<00:01:16.350> corner<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> end<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
okay fold the front corner at the end of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:38.500 
okay fold the front corner at the end of
the<00:01:18.570> triangles<00:01:21.229> okay<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:24.509> this

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.880 

now<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:39.930> something<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> looks

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
now you will have something that looks

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
now you will have something that looks
like<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.730> turn<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.660> around<00:01:44.660> turn<00:01:45.660> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
like this and turn this around turn it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.340 
like this and turn this around turn it
around<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.410> fold<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.660> on<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> other

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
around and fold this on to the other

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.700 
around and fold this on to the other
side<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.710> hack<00:01:50.990> now<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> should<00:01:52.440> look<00:01:52.650> like

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
side of hack now it should look like

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.420 
side of hack now it should look like
that<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.370> have<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.910> do<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:58.280> turn<00:01:59.280> the

that so what you have to do now turn the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.469 
that so what you have to do now turn the
paper<00:01:59.610> around<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.330> bit

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
paper around and now it's a bit

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
paper around and now it's a bit
difficult<00:02:06.680> good<00:02:07.680> let<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:09.920> okay<00:02:10.920> i<00:02:11.130> will

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
difficult good let this okay i will

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.080 
difficult good let this okay i will
repeat<00:02:13.459> grab<00:02:14.459> into<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.450> fold<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
repeat grab into and fold this to a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.640 
repeat grab into and fold this to a
corner<00:02:21.170> okay<00:02:23.300> for<00:02:24.300> 28<00:02:24.570> degrees<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.350> things

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
corner okay for 28 degrees of things

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.390 
corner okay for 28 degrees of things
okay<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> i<00:02:27.780> will<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:29.870> ok<00:02:30.870> i<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
okay so i will do this ok i will do it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.180 
okay so i will do this ok i will do it
slowly<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.269> other<00:02:33.390> side<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:35.010> this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:55.810 

ok<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:52.830> your<00:02:53.010> plan<00:02:53.280> should<00:02:53.310> look<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
ok now your plan should look like this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.970 
ok now your plan should look like this
ok<00:02:57.530> ok<00:02:59.120> that<00:03:00.120> was<00:03:00.360> most<00:03:00.660> difficult<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.950> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
ok ok that was most difficult now it is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.640 
ok ok that was most difficult now it is
very<00:03:02.340> simple<00:03:02.640> ok<00:03:03.680> let's<00:03:04.680> go

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.640 

fold<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:12.150> side<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.140> middle<00:03:13.410> flow<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
fold this side to the middle flow to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.480 
fold this side to the middle flow to
create<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> leading<00:03:14.640> edge<00:03:22.160> same<00:03:23.160> thing<00:03:23.370> at

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
create the leading edge same thing at

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.880 
create the leading edge same thing at
the<00:03:23.520> other<00:03:23.670> side<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:28.080> have<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.350> needing<00:03:28.680> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
the other side and you have to needing a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:40.550 
the other side and you have to needing a
display<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:36.480> should<00:03:36.930> look<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:39.560> other

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
display it should look like this other

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:51.620 
display it should look like this other
side<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:44.180> ok<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.239> let's<00:03:45.660> go<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:49.550> ok<00:03:50.550> fold<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
side this ok so let's go on ok fold it

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.090 
side this ok so let's go on ok fold it
in<00:03:51.780> half<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.300> is<00:03:54.630> at<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> bottom<00:03:56.250> ok<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
in half so this is at the bottom ok and

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.420 
in half so this is at the bottom ok and
then<00:03:59.100> put<00:03:59.820> wings<00:04:00.120> down<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> middle<00:04:00.989> fold

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
then put wings down to the middle fold

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:22.069 
then put wings down to the middle fold
like<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:04.850> that's<00:04:05.850> very<00:04:06.030> simple<00:04:21.019> now<00:04:22.019> you

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
like this that's very simple now you

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:33.080 
like this that's very simple now you
plane<00:04:22.500> should<00:04:23.490> look<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:23.790> this<00:04:27.800> ok<00:04:32.090> should

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
plane should look like this ok should

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.270 
plane should look like this ok should
look<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.130> now<00:04:36.560> how<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.590> throw<00:04:38.160> it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
look like this and now how to throw it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:49.670 
look like this and now how to throw it
shoot<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.310> at<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:41.760> position<00:04:42.919> ok<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:48.680> throw

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
shoot it at this position ok and throw

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.080 
shoot it at this position ok and throw
it<00:04:51.140> side<00:04:52.140> what<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.919> bit<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.669> or<00:04:54.270> throw<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:56.090> up

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
it side what a bit up or throw it up

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:09.110 
it side what a bit up or throw it up
like<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:59.630> ok<00:05:00.630> let's<00:05:01.050> go<00:05:02.390> this<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:05.160> or<00:05:06.120> this

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
