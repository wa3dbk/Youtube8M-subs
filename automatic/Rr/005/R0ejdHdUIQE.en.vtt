00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.700 
especially since some of the Digimon
have<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.970> weirdest<00:03:52.750> stands<00:03:53.110> patterns

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
have the weirdest stands patterns

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.340 
have the weirdest stands patterns
because<00:03:54.780> depending<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:56.020> where<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.260> stand

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
because depending on where you stand

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.680 
because depending on where you stand
your<00:03:56.860> Digimon<00:03:57.280> gives<00:03:57.520> support<00:03:58.120> ability<00:03:58.600> is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
your Digimon gives support ability is

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.090 
your Digimon gives support ability is
like<00:03:59.640> some<00:04:00.640> Digimon<00:04:01.090> give<00:04:01.600> plus<00:04:02.110> 10<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.770> speed

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
like some Digimon give plus 10 to speed

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.910 
like some Digimon give plus 10 to speed
to<00:04:03.370> hover<00:04:03.640> next<00:04:04.150> right<00:04:04.390> next<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> them<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.860> it

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
to hover next right next to them so it

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.370 
to hover next right next to them so it
makes<00:04:06.250> absolutely<00:04:06.790> no<00:04:06.940> sense<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.840> spread<00:04:08.230> out

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
makes absolutely no sense to spread out

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.740 
makes absolutely no sense to spread out
your<00:04:08.590> Digimon<00:04:14.910> but<00:04:15.910> apparently<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.450> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
your Digimon but apparently that the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.039 
your Digimon but apparently that the
NPC's<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.950> bomb<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.209> enemy<00:04:19.329> did<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.900> want

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
NPC's the bomb the enemy did you want

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.290 
NPC's the bomb the enemy did you want
don't<00:04:20.290> either<00:04:20.440> know<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.980> or<00:04:21.700> really<00:04:22.090> just

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
don't either know that or really just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:32.870 
don't either know that or really just
don't<00:04:22.510> care<00:04:23.700> are<00:04:24.700> two<00:04:25.210> on<00:04:25.390> well<00:04:25.660> thought<00:04:25.930> out

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:44.660 

magic

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.580 

I<00:04:46.190> pause<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.430> battle<00:04:47.760> just<00:04:47.880> because<00:04:48.560> she's<00:04:49.560> a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
I pause that battle just because she's a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.740 
I pause that battle just because she's a
just<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.670> annoying<00:04:50.910> ultimate<00:04:51.540> with

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
just a really annoying ultimate with

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.580 
just a really annoying ultimate with
lots<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.650> stuns<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.460> group<00:04:53.880> paralysis<00:04:54.630> she<00:04:55.470> is

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
lots of stuns and group paralysis she is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.230 
lots of stuns and group paralysis she is
it<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:55.980> much<00:04:56.220> like<00:04:56.460> it's<00:04:56.640> going<00:04:56.880> out<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.090> style

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.860 

knowing<00:06:22.020> people<00:06:22.470> probably<00:06:23.509> they'll<00:06:24.509> take<00:06:24.720> it

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
knowing people probably they'll take it

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.380 

honestly<00:06:52.760> before

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.270 

this<00:06:57.020> last<00:06:57.290> part<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.740> video<00:06:57.950> was<00:06:58.160> actually

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
this last part the video was actually

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.170 
this last part the video was actually
only<00:06:58.640> like<00:06:58.880> six<00:06:59.330> minutes<00:06:59.570> and<00:06:59.900> 16<00:07:00.590> seconds<00:07:01.180> but

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
only like six minutes and 16 seconds but

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.600 
only like six minutes and 16 seconds but
I<00:07:02.210> added<00:07:02.570> the<00:07:03.040> meat<00:07:04.040> getting<00:07:04.370> to<00:07:04.490> the<00:07:04.580> boss<00:07:04.880> cos

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
I added the meat getting to the boss cos

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.270 
I added the meat getting to the boss cos
when<00:07:07.610> I<00:07:07.730> was<00:07:07.940> stopped<00:07:08.690> her<00:07:08.840> corner<00:07:09.140> I<00:07:09.280> didn't

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
when I was stopped her corner I didn't

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.300 
when I was stopped her corner I didn't
realize<00:07:10.760> how<00:07:11.000> short<00:07:11.390> it<00:07:11.540> was<00:07:11.570> so<00:07:12.020> I<00:07:12.310> scattered

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
realize how short it was so I scattered

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.740 
realize how short it was so I scattered
around<00:07:13.430> a<00:07:13.730> bit<00:07:13.940> ah<00:07:15.880> well<00:07:16.880> I<00:07:16.940> wasn't<00:07:17.180> recording

around a bit ah well I wasn't recording
and<00:07:17.870> i<00:07:17.930> found<00:07:18.140> the<00:07:18.260> pathway<00:07:18.710> to<00:07:18.770> the<00:07:18.890> pond<00:07:19.100> so<00:07:19.340> I

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
and i found the pathway to the pond so I

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.390 
and i found the pathway to the pond so I
just<00:07:19.610> said<00:07:19.970> man<00:07:20.420> I<00:07:20.600> might<00:07:20.780> as<00:07:20.840> well<00:07:21.220> put<00:07:22.220> this

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.010 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.980
