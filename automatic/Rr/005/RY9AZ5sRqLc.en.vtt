actually supposed to be so one thing I
actually<00:01:26.950> did<00:01:27.220> think<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.640> yesterday<00:01:27.880> was<00:01:28.780> I

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
actually did think of yesterday was I

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually did think of yesterday was I
was<00:01:28.960> trying<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.170> find<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.440> way<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.619> make<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.040> to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
was trying to find a way to make it to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.730 
was trying to find a way to make it to
where<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.700> didn't<00:01:31.210> like<00:01:31.300> how<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.570> grass<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
where I didn't like how the grass in the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.469 
where I didn't like how the grass in the
stonework<00:01:33.100> exactly<00:01:33.759> even<00:01:34.030> with<00:01:34.149> each<00:01:34.300> other

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
stonework exactly even with each other

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.330 
stonework exactly even with each other
it's<00:01:35.350> always<00:01:35.530> kind<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:35.890> thing<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.130> something

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
it's always kind of thing of something

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.830 
it's always kind of thing of something
that<00:01:36.550> would<00:01:36.670> kind<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.940> offset<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.630> little

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
that would kind of offset it a little

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.570 
that would kind of offset it a little
bit<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.320> kind<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.770> give<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:38.979> like<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> small<00:01:39.369> edge

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
bit to kind of give it like a small edge

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.030 
bit to kind of give it like a small edge
and<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:40.510> I<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.680> feeling<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.710> was<00:01:41.799> like<00:01:41.890> oh

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
and then I the feeling I was like oh

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.630 
and then I the feeling I was like oh
yeah<00:01:42.549> snow<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.510> snow<00:01:44.260> doesn't<00:01:44.500> melt<00:01:44.640> under

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
yeah snow and snow doesn't melt under

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.789 
yeah snow and snow doesn't melt under
this<00:01:46.000> under<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.600> Sun<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.810> was<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.049> snow<00:01:47.619> would

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
this under the Sun I was like snow would

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.800 
this under the Sun I was like snow would
be<00:01:47.830> an<00:01:47.950> awesome<00:01:48.070> idea<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:49.330> will<00:01:49.540> see<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.780> on

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
be an awesome idea so you will see it on

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.359 
be an awesome idea so you will see it on
the<00:01:49.900> map<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.290> lot<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.650> snow<00:01:50.710> around<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
the map a lot of the snow around the

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.640 
the map a lot of the snow around the
edges<00:01:51.760> I'll<00:01:52.150> just<00:01:52.420> cuz<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.960> my<00:01:53.229> opinion<00:01:53.530> it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
edges I'll just cuz in my opinion it

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.840 
edges I'll just cuz in my opinion it
makes<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.920> look<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.070> little<00:01:54.220> bit<00:01:54.369> better<00:01:54.520> add<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
makes it look a little bit better add a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.780 
makes it look a little bit better add a
little<00:01:55.060> bit<00:01:55.180> more<00:01:55.330> color<00:01:55.570> as<00:01:55.780> well<00:01:56.640> let's<00:01:57.640> go

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
little bit more color as well let's go

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.190 
little bit more color as well let's go
over<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> bottom<00:01:58.420> part<00:01:58.689> of<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.810> map<00:01:58.990> you

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
over to the bottom part of the map you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.090 
over to the bottom part of the map you
guys<00:01:59.350> have<00:01:59.530> basically<00:01:59.710> seen<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:02.100> not

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
guys have basically seen all of this not

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.010 
guys have basically seen all of this not
only<00:02:03.189> too<00:02:03.520> many<00:02:03.700> new<00:02:03.850> buildings<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.479> think

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
only too many new buildings I think

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.770 
only too many new buildings I think
these<00:02:05.140> were<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.439> last<00:02:06.119> update<00:02:07.119> video<00:02:07.420> but

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
these were in the last update video but

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.749 
these were in the last update video but
I'm<00:02:07.869> not<00:02:07.990> exactly<00:02:08.229> sure<00:02:08.440> here's<00:02:09.250> some<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
I'm not exactly sure here's some of the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.699 
I'm not exactly sure here's some of the
new<00:02:09.880> ones<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.390> know<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.260> building<00:02:11.440> right<00:02:11.680> here

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
new ones I know this building right here

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.090 
new ones I know this building right here
was<00:02:12.070> not<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.610> last<00:02:12.790> video<00:02:14.100> there's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
was not in the last video there's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.800 
was not in the last video there's
actually<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.459> apartment<00:02:16.120> complex<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.660> always

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
actually a apartment complex I always

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.840 
actually a apartment complex I always
say<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.959> will<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.260> when<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:17.530> done<00:02:17.739> again<00:02:18.640> no

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
say it will be when it's done again no

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.729 
say it will be when it's done again no
interior<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.660> done<00:02:19.900> yet<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.440> all<00:02:20.590> be

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
interior is done yet that will all be

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.340 
interior is done yet that will all be
done<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> very<00:02:21.250> end<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:22.840> right<00:02:23.019> here's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
done at the very end all right here's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.930 
done at the very end all right here's
the<00:02:23.410> highway<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.040> highway<00:02:24.070> spacing<00:02:24.700> then<00:02:24.820> go

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
the highway the highway spacing then go

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.910 
the highway the highway spacing then go
all<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.239> way<00:02:25.600> around<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> map<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:26.829> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
all the way around the map so if you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.130 
all the way around the map so if you
look<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> left<00:02:27.670> side<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.209> at<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.750> top

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
look on the left side and at the top

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.280 
look on the left side and at the top
right<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.280> will<00:02:30.400> kind<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.730> see<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
right you will kind of see that the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.509 
right you will kind of see that the
highways<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.829> go<00:02:32.890> all<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.190> way<00:02:33.310> around

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
highways going to go all the way around

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.190 
highways going to go all the way around
the<00:02:33.610> map<00:02:33.790> basically<00:02:34.269> around<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.570> actual<00:02:34.840> city

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the map basically around the actual city

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.300 
the map basically around the actual city
itself<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:37.060> over<00:02:37.329> here<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.100> mall

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
itself and then over here is the mall

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.069 
itself and then over here is the mall
I'm<00:02:39.760> actually<00:02:39.970> really<00:02:40.269> happy<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> mall

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
I'm actually really happy with the mall

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.479 
I'm actually really happy with the mall
the<00:02:41.320> mall<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.590> probably<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.070> my<00:02:42.190> favorite

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
the mall is probably one of my favorite

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.580 
the mall is probably one of my favorite
things<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> map<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:44.200> because<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
things on the map now this because the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.220 
things on the map now this because the
way<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.799> looks<00:02:45.070> because<00:02:45.609> I<00:02:46.030> probably<00:02:46.660> redid

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
way it looks because I probably redid

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.910 
way it looks because I probably redid
the<00:02:47.380> small<00:02:47.650> probably<00:02:48.040> four<00:02:48.310> or<00:02:48.549> five<00:02:48.820> times

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the small probably four or five times

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.050 
the small probably four or five times
just<00:02:50.040> trying<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> get<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.400> design<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
just trying to get a design that I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
just trying to get a design that I
actually<00:02:51.390> liked<00:02:51.720> myself<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:53.010> came<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.220> with

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
actually liked myself and I came up with

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.309 
actually liked myself and I came up with
this<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.450> I'm<00:02:54.540> actually<00:02:54.630> pretty<00:02:54.900> happy<00:02:55.020> with

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
this and I'm actually pretty happy with

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.380 
this and I'm actually pretty happy with
it<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.640> fits<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> well<00:02:57.209> with<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it I think it it fits in well with the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.880 
it I think it it fits in well with the
map<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.780> well<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:59.160> actually<00:02:59.280> uses<00:03:00.560> sand<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
map as well it actually uses sand and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.110 
map as well it actually uses sand and
bricks<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.459> believe<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.610> using<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
bricks I believe and this is using the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.880 
bricks I believe and this is using the
neck<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.569> natural<00:03:06.959> texture<00:03:07.260> pack<00:03:07.410> that's<00:03:07.650> why

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
neck the natural texture pack that's why

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.160 
neck the natural texture pack that's why
the<00:03:07.950> glass<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> glass<00:03:08.760> panes<00:03:09.239> are<00:03:09.540> yellow

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
the glass and the glass panes are yellow

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.380 
the glass and the glass panes are yellow
just<00:03:11.010> because<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.430> more<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.819> medieval

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
just because it's more of a medieval

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.180 
just because it's more of a medieval
theme<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.560> building<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:13.920> it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
theme but I do like building with it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.009 
theme but I do like building with it
just<00:03:14.340> because<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.720> kind<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:15.989> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
just because I just kind of have a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.270 
just because I just kind of have a
modern<00:03:16.319> look<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.769> well

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
modern look to it as well

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.229 
modern look to it as well
for<00:03:17.670> some<00:03:17.790> reason<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.360> might<00:03:18.569> just<00:03:18.780> be<00:03:18.810> me

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
for some reason that might just be me

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.790 
for some reason that might just be me
yeah<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> mall<00:03:21.930> nothing<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
yeah but this is the mall nothing on the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.949 
yeah but this is the mall nothing on the
interior<00:03:23.310> yet<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.880> will<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
interior yet that will be one of the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.650 
interior yet that will be one of the
first<00:03:25.170> things<00:03:25.380> done<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.950> map<00:03:26.239> yeah<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.510> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
first things done on the map yeah but I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.449 
first things done on the map yeah but I
really<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.019> how<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.200> mall<00:03:28.440> looks<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:29.100> it's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
really like how the mall looks is it's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.250 
really like how the mall looks is it's
just<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.850> those<00:03:29.940> buildings<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.840> had

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
just one of those buildings that I had

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320 
just one of those buildings that I had
this<00:03:31.470> much<00:03:31.739> space<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.610> fit<00:03:32.790> perfectly<00:03:33.180> in

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
this much space and it fit perfectly in

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.240 
this much space and it fit perfectly in
the<00:03:33.360> space<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.680> think<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.980> looks<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the space and I think it looks like a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.420 
the space and I think it looks like a
real<00:03:35.459> mall<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.620> too<00:03:37.799> big<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.310> not

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
real mall it's not too big but it's not

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.670 
real mall it's not too big but it's not
too<00:03:38.549> small<00:03:38.850> either<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.930> wanted<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> go<00:03:40.440> out

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
too small either and I wanted to go out

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.979 
too small either and I wanted to go out
of<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.459> normal<00:03:41.880> if<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.540> look<00:03:42.690> at<00:03:42.810> malls

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
of the normal if you look at malls

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.100 
of the normal if you look at malls
usually<00:03:43.440> they're<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.310> square<00:03:45.110> there's

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
usually they're really square there's

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.570 
usually they're really square there's
not<00:03:46.260> really<00:03:46.440> too<00:03:46.560> much<00:03:46.709> designed<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> him<00:03:47.340> and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
not really too much designed to him and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.850 
not really too much designed to him and
my<00:03:48.000> goal<00:03:48.569> when<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.019> making<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.650> to

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
my goal when I was making this was to

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.380 
my goal when I was making this was to
try<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.069> add<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> little<00:03:50.430> bit<00:03:50.519> more<00:03:50.610> design<00:03:51.090> to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
try to add a little bit more design to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.900 
try to add a little bit more design to
the<00:03:51.510> building<00:03:52.040> right<00:03:53.040> across<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.489> street<00:03:53.760> we

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
the building right across the street we

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.050 
the building right across the street we
have<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.329> pretty<00:03:54.690> long<00:03:54.870> parking<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.650> just

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
have a pretty long parking lot just

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.940 
have a pretty long parking lot just
because<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> couldn't<00:03:57.720> find<00:03:57.840> any<00:03:58.049> parking<00:03:58.500> like

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
because I couldn't find any parking like

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.099 
because I couldn't find any parking like
where<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.220> put<00:03:59.400> parking<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> decided<00:04:00.450> right

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
where to put parking so I decided right

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.330 
where to put parking so I decided right
here<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.440> edge<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> map<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.160> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
here on the edge of the map that a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.890 
here on the edge of the map that a
parking<00:04:02.940> lot<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.150> actually<00:04:03.390> fit<00:04:03.540> perfectly

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
parking lot would actually fit perfectly

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.110 
parking lot would actually fit perfectly
in<00:04:04.049> here<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.190> made<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.670> pretty<00:04:05.940> long

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
in here and so I made a pretty long

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
in here and so I made a pretty long
parking<00:04:06.510> garage<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:07.109> he<00:04:07.590> there's<00:04:08.100> actually

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
parking garage if he there's actually

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.720 
parking garage if he there's actually
two<00:04:08.489> stories<00:04:08.700> tall<00:04:10.130> finally<00:04:11.130> these<00:04:11.310> buildings

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
two stories tall finally these buildings

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.539 
two stories tall finally these buildings
from<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.480> think<00:04:13.230> 1.2<00:04:13.769> are<00:04:13.950> finally<00:04:14.280> done<00:04:14.400> as

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
from I think 1.2 are finally done as

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.319 
from I think 1.2 are finally done as
well<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:15.630> think<00:04:16.320> 1.2<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:16.919> had<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.910> really<00:04:18.060> tall

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
well I think 1.2 I had the really tall

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.840 
well I think 1.2 I had the really tall
one<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.260> my<00:04:19.380> left<00:04:19.850> done

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
one and then the one to my left done

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.450 
one and then the one to my left done
well<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.450> would<00:04:21.570> say<00:04:21.690> fully<00:04:21.930> done<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.979> now<00:04:23.130> all

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
well I would say fully done but now all

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.070 
well I would say fully done but now all
three<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.910> these<00:04:23.970> are<00:04:24.210> fully<00:04:24.450> done<00:04:24.660> again

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
three of these are fully done again

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.130 
three of these are fully done again
besides<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.650> interior<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.550> windows<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
besides the interior and the windows the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.900 
besides the interior and the windows the
parking<00:04:28.470> lot<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:29.039> little<00:04:29.280> bit<00:04:29.370> interesting

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
parking lot was a little bit interesting

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.909 
parking lot was a little bit interesting
just<00:04:30.120> cuz<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.750> had<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.500> try<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.650> make<00:04:31.860> it

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
just cuz I had to try to make it

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.680 
just cuz I had to try to make it
symmetrical<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:33.060> because<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.360> was<00:04:33.600> like

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
symmetrical it just because it was like

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.250 
symmetrical it just because it was like
in<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.870> perfect<00:04:34.229> square<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.930> building

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
in a perfect square and this building

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.659 
in a perfect square and this building
right<00:04:37.380> here<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.770> actually<00:04:38.039> a<00:04:38.100> newer<00:04:38.460> building

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
right here is actually a newer building

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.580 
right here is actually a newer building
as<00:04:39.000> well<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.830> 1.2<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.729> had<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.450> building<00:04:42.960> here

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
as well so in 1.2 I had a building here

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.500 
as well so in 1.2 I had a building here
in<00:04:43.740> place<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.520> one<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.880> was<00:04:45.210> using

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
in place of this one that was using

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.800 
in place of this one that was using
stone<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.139> bran<00:04:46.740> will<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.039> believe<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.810> it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
stone and bran will I believe and it

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.570 
stone and bran will I believe and it
really<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.289> never<00:04:49.500> got<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.889> building<00:04:50.160> done<00:04:50.370> I

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
really I never got the building done I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.129 
really I never got the building done I
couldn't<00:04:50.880> think<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.210> where<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.750> go<00:04:51.930> with<00:04:52.050> it

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
couldn't think of where to go with it

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.140 
couldn't think of where to go with it
next<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.190> decided<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.669> tear<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.120> down

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
next so I decided to tear it down

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.700 
next so I decided to tear it down
because<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.660> wasn't<00:04:54.810> too<00:04:55.020> much<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.500> and

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
because there wasn't too much to it and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.710 
because there wasn't too much to it and
I<00:04:56.280> ended<00:04:56.430> up<00:04:56.520> making<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:57.000> building<00:04:57.240> here

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
I ended up making this building here

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
I ended up making this building here
which<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.229> actually<00:04:58.320> thinks<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.520> really<00:05:00.060> good

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
which I actually thinks is a really good

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.850 
which I actually thinks is a really good
building<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:00.960> fits<00:05:01.260> in<00:05:01.380> where<00:05:01.770> the

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
building it really fits in where the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.820 
building it really fits in where the
park<00:05:02.099> is

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
park is

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.270 
park is
uh<00:05:04.470> I'll<00:05:05.470> show<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.740> more<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.010> building

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
uh I'll show you more of that building

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.460 
uh I'll show you more of that building
here<00:05:06.430> in<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.550> second<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.000> also<00:05:07.660> this<00:05:08.050> bridge<00:05:08.290> I

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
here in a second and also this bridge I

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.960 
here in a second and also this bridge I
did<00:05:08.620> add<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.860> little<00:05:09.040> bit<00:05:09.160> more<00:05:09.190> design<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.820> it

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
did add a little bit more design to it

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.450 
did add a little bit more design to it
because<00:05:10.360> me<00:05:11.050> being<00:05:11.290> me<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.470> didn't<00:05:11.920> like<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
because me being me I didn't like the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.030 
because me being me I didn't like the
natural<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.810> flat<00:05:14.200> bridge<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:14.980> I

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
natural and just the flat bridge so I

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.830 
natural and just the flat bridge so I
decided<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.460> build<00:05:15.670> on<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.060> give<00:05:16.720> it<00:05:16.750> a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
decided to build on it and give it a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.880 
decided to build on it and give it a
little<00:05:16.930> bit<00:05:17.050> more<00:05:17.170> look<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.620> it

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
little bit more look to it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.770 
little bit more look to it
and<00:05:17.980> that<00:05:18.820> building<00:05:19.120> we<00:05:19.240> were<00:05:19.330> just<00:05:19.480> talking

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
and that building we were just talking

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.410 
and that building we were just talking
about<00:05:19.840> that<00:05:20.470> building<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:20.950> basically<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.820> it

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
about that building is basically just it

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.510 
about that building is basically just it
starts<00:05:22.960> at<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.110> bottom<00:05:23.230> really<00:05:23.890> wide<00:05:24.250> and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
starts at the bottom really wide and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.090 
starts at the bottom really wide and
then<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.850> gets<00:05:25.000> thinner<00:05:25.210> going<00:05:25.810> up<00:05:26.010> so<00:05:27.010> that's

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
then it gets thinner going up so that's

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.890 
then it gets thinner going up so that's
the<00:05:27.520> basically<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.270> design<00:05:28.420> of<00:05:28.720> that

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
the basically the design of that

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.120 
the basically the design of that
building<00:05:29.200> as<00:05:29.320> well<00:05:29.530> ah<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.830> guys<00:05:32.950> have

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
building as well ah you guys have

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.470 
building as well ah you guys have
already<00:05:33.220> seen<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.580> new<00:05:33.700> park<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.120> was<00:05:34.390> in

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
already seen the new park that was in

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.650 
already seen the new park that was in
the<00:05:34.600> last<00:05:34.780> one<00:05:34.990> as<00:05:35.110> well<00:05:35.520> basically<00:05:36.520> like<00:05:36.880> what

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
the last one as well basically like what

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.900 
the last one as well basically like what
1.3<00:05:38.380> is<00:05:38.500> is<00:05:38.680> trying<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.070> finish<00:05:39.220> up<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.670> lot<00:05:39.820> of

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
1.3 is is trying to finish up a lot of

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.900 
1.3 is is trying to finish up a lot of
the<00:05:40.000> buildings<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.480> weren't<00:05:41.170> done<00:05:41.910> besides

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
the buildings that weren't done besides

the windows and everything and trying to

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.470 
the windows and everything and trying to
add<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.890> little<00:05:45.040> bit<00:05:45.130> more<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.460> look<00:05:45.670> and<00:05:45.880> all

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
add a little bit more to look and all

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.070 
add a little bit more to look and all
these<00:05:46.900> little<00:05:47.700> stone<00:05:48.700> bricks<00:05:48.940> what<00:05:49.930> are<00:05:49.990> these

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
these little stone bricks what are these

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.540 
these little stone bricks what are these
called<00:05:50.230> chilled<00:05:50.530> chilled<00:05:50.920> stone<00:05:51.310> bricks

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
called chilled chilled stone bricks

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.230 
called chilled chilled stone bricks
that's<00:05:51.730> what<00:05:51.850> they<00:05:51.940> are<00:05:52.950> basically<00:05:54.240> just

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
that's what they are basically just

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.520 
that's what they are basically just
trying<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.480> make<00:05:55.600> it<00:05:55.690> look<00:05:55.840> more<00:05:55.990> grey<00:05:56.290> on<00:05:56.440> the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
trying to make it look more grey on the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.560 
trying to make it look more grey on the
map<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:57.130> as<00:05:57.190> you<00:05:57.340> can<00:05:57.400> see<00:05:57.460> it's<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.120> lot<00:05:58.390> more

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
map so as you can see it's a lot more

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.870 
map so as you can see it's a lot more
grey<00:05:58.780> on<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.020> map<00:05:59.230> then<00:05:59.770> hopefully<00:06:00.250> by<00:06:00.280> one

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
grey on the map then hopefully by one

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.810 
grey on the map then hopefully by one
point<00:06:01.150> for<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:02.320> actual<00:06:02.500> city<00:06:02.830> itself<00:06:03.460> will<00:06:03.700> be

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
point for the actual city itself will be

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.790 
point for the actual city itself will be
done<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.600> that<00:06:04.720> can<00:06:04.840> go<00:06:05.050> over<00:06:05.290> and<00:06:05.380> trying<00:06:05.710> to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
done and that can go over and trying to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.360 
done and that can go over and trying to
start<00:06:05.950> working<00:06:06.220> on<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.550> residential<00:06:07.060> areas

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
start working on the residential areas

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.340 
start working on the residential areas
people<00:06:09.370> who<00:06:09.640> do<00:06:09.940> join<00:06:10.180> my<00:06:10.330> Maps<00:06:10.600> they<00:06:10.870> do<00:06:10.930> ask

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
people who do join my Maps they do ask

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.560 
people who do join my Maps they do ask
me<00:06:11.700> what's<00:06:12.700> going<00:06:12.850> to<00:06:12.910> go<00:06:13.000> on<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.300> other<00:06:13.450> side

me what's going to go on the other side
of<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.410> river<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:14.920> it's<00:06:15.430> gonna<00:06:15.550> be<00:06:15.700> a

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
of the river and it's gonna be a

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.910 
of the river and it's gonna be a
residential<00:06:16.330> area<00:06:16.630> there's<00:06:17.410> gonna<00:06:17.530> be<00:06:17.650> a<00:06:17.680> lot

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
residential area there's gonna be a lot

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.790 
residential area there's gonna be a lot
of<00:06:17.950> modern<00:06:18.640> some<00:06:19.330> older<00:06:19.630> style<00:06:19.870> houses<00:06:20.080> stuff

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
of modern some older style houses stuff

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.490 
of modern some older style houses stuff
like<00:06:20.980> that<00:06:21.540> I'm<00:06:22.540> not<00:06:22.720> exactly<00:06:22.930> too<00:06:23.230> sure<00:06:23.470> yet

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
like that I'm not exactly too sure yet

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.040 
like that I'm not exactly too sure yet
that's<00:06:24.010> why<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.220> bridge<00:06:24.520> is<00:06:24.700> I<00:06:24.940> I<00:06:25.720> try<00:06:25.990> to

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
that's why the bridge is I I try to

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.150 
that's why the bridge is I I try to
point<00:06:26.200> everything<00:06:26.530> out<00:06:26.680> that's<00:06:26.920> why<00:06:27.070> the

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
point everything out that's why the

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.830 
point everything out that's why the
bridges<00:06:27.550> don't<00:06:27.730> fully<00:06:28.030> go<00:06:28.180> down<00:06:28.420> yet

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
bridges don't fully go down yet

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.510 
bridges don't fully go down yet
just<00:06:29.380> cuz<00:06:29.500> I'm<00:06:29.650> trying<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:29.890> figure<00:06:29.980> out<00:06:30.100> what

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
just cuz I'm trying to figure out what

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.270 
just cuz I'm trying to figure out what
I'm<00:06:30.610> going<00:06:30.820> to<00:06:30.880> do<00:06:31.090> with<00:06:31.210> all<00:06:31.360> this<00:06:31.570> and<00:06:31.840> I<00:06:32.830> had

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
I'm going to do with all this and I had

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.620 
I'm going to do with all this and I had
to<00:06:33.400> come<00:06:33.640> up<00:06:33.670> with<00:06:33.790> designs<00:06:34.240> for<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.480> houses

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
to come up with designs for the houses

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.390 
to come up with designs for the houses
that<00:06:34.900> will<00:06:35.020> fit<00:06:35.290> because<00:06:35.890> I'm<00:06:36.070> trying<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.310> go

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
that will fit because I'm trying to go

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.250 
that will fit because I'm trying to go
for<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:36.940> little<00:06:37.360> bit<00:06:37.480> of<00:06:37.630> realism<00:06:37.810> when<00:06:38.170> it

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
for a little bit of realism when it

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.750 
for a little bit of realism when it
comes<00:06:38.410> to<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:38.770> buildings<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.400> stuff<00:06:39.580> like

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
comes to the buildings and stuff like

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.260 
comes to the buildings and stuff like
that<00:06:40.650> so<00:06:41.650> far<00:06:41.890> this<00:06:42.160> is<00:06:42.340> probably<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.120> best

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
that so far this is probably the best

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.450 
that so far this is probably the best
city<00:06:43.510> I've<00:06:43.660> made<00:06:43.870> easily<00:06:44.470> it's<00:06:45.190> so<00:06:45.310> much

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
city I've made easily it's so much

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.790 
city I've made easily it's so much
better<00:06:45.640> than<00:06:45.820> my<00:06:45.880> old<00:06:46.030> one<00:06:46.150> and<00:06:46.720> to<00:06:47.470> download

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
better than my old one and to download

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.320 
better than my old one and to download
it<00:06:47.920> you<00:06:48.040> can<00:06:48.190> actually<00:06:48.310> download<00:06:48.520> this<00:06:48.940> for

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
the 360 version I'm not sure if it works

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.580

for<00:06:51.610> PC<00:06:52.030> guys<00:06:52.240> I'm<00:06:52.660> pretty<00:06:52.990> sure<00:06:53.170> it<00:06:53.260> doesn't

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
for PC guys I'm pretty sure it doesn't

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.650
