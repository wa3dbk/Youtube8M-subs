about<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.470> pencil<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> actually

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
about this pencil is that it actually

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.959 
about this pencil is that it actually
allows<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:58.229> creamy<00:01:58.530> texture<00:01:58.950> allows<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
allows the creamy texture allows the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.620 
allows the creamy texture allows the
glitter<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.600> show<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.820> first<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.180> Midnight

Cowboy

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830 

so<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> topi<00:02:09.849> color<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.450> glittery

so it's like a topi color it's glittery

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.210 
so it's like a topi color it's glittery
maybe<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.920> little<00:02:12.069> bit<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.430> Goldie<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:15.099> it's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
maybe a little bit more Goldie but it's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.589 
maybe a little bit more Goldie but it's

the pigment I really like that the

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.090 
the pigment I really like that the
glitter<00:06:13.540> shows<00:06:13.840> up<00:06:14.050> even<00:06:14.200> though<00:06:14.530> without

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
glitter shows up even though without

using<00:06:15.460> glitter<00:06:15.760> glue<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:18.130> then<00:06:18.370> just<00:06:18.550> an

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
using glitter glue and then just an

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.630 
using glitter glue and then just an
overall<00:06:18.970> good<00:06:19.410> product<00:06:20.410> and<00:06:20.500> however<00:06:21.280> in<00:06:21.490> my

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
overall good product and however in my

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.740 
overall good product and however in my
opinion<00:06:21.670> is<00:06:22.150> is<00:06:22.330> I've<00:06:23.050> had<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:24.750> Midnight

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
opinion is is I've had the Midnight

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.080 
opinion is is I've had the Midnight
Cowboy<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:27.010> great<00:06:27.550> dark<00:06:27.730> green<00:06:27.940> one<00:06:28.060> for

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
Cowboy and the great dark green one for

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.730 
Cowboy and the great dark green one for
a<00:06:28.360> while<00:06:28.510> now<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:29.080> I<00:06:29.170> notice<00:06:29.470> that<00:06:29.590> it's

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
a while now and I notice that it's

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.590 
a while now and I notice that it's
starting<00:06:30.130> to<00:06:30.310> dry<00:06:30.520> out<00:06:30.550> a<00:06:30.700> little<00:06:30.820> bit<00:06:31.120> so

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
starting to dry out a little bit so

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.450 
starting to dry out a little bit so
that's<00:06:31.660> my<00:06:31.810> only<00:06:32.020> concern<00:06:32.140> is<00:06:32.680> that<00:06:32.740> he's<00:06:33.430> a

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
that's my only concern is that he's a

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.940 
that's my only concern is that he's a
little<00:06:33.700> dry<00:06:33.880> out<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.540> don't<00:06:35.380> use<00:06:35.590> them<00:06:35.770> went

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
little dry out and I don't use them went

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.980 
little dry out and I don't use them went
off<00:06:36.070> on<00:06:36.100> regular<00:06:36.520> basis<00:06:36.820> to<00:06:36.850> even<00:06:37.330> get<00:06:37.780> closer

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
off on regular basis to even get closer

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.720 
off on regular basis to even get closer
using<00:06:38.440> them<00:06:38.560> all<00:06:38.710> I<00:06:38.920> know<00:06:39.400> they're<00:06:39.550> already

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
using them all I know they're already

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.270 
using them all I know they're already
starting<00:06:39.850> to<00:06:40.120> dry<00:06:40.270> out<00:06:40.300> so<00:06:41.010> I<00:06:42.010> would<00:06:42.190> just

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
starting to dry out so I would just

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.530 
starting to dry out so I would just
recommend<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:42.790> really<00:06:43.030> make<00:06:43.180> from<00:06:43.330> that<00:06:43.360> the

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
recommend to really make from that the

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.210 
recommend to really make from that the
tops<00:06:43.750> are<00:06:43.900> closed<00:06:44.170> because<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:44.860> think<00:06:45.070> that's

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
tops are closed because I think that's

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.710 
tops are closed because I think that's
probably<00:06:45.430> what<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.760> problem<00:06:46.030> was<00:06:46.120> I<00:06:46.330> wasn't

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
probably what the problem was I wasn't

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.909 
probably what the problem was I wasn't
making<00:06:46.810> trouble<00:06:47.230> at<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.350> top<00:06:47.530> through<00:06:47.770> one

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
making trouble at the top through one

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.000 
making trouble at the top through one
hundred<00:06:48.160> percent<00:06:48.190> closed<00:06:49.650> so<00:06:50.650> make<00:06:50.800> sure<00:06:50.830> the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
hundred percent closed so make sure the

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.350
