00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.440
 hello guys everybody have a nice day today 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.220
 we will take this job with you 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.470
 This thing is an assistant in order 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.169
 so that the computer was easier to laptop in 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.989
 particulars this is an extra cooler then 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.230
 there is from a laptop from here at least 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.669
 as far as I go into the air from here and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.000
 using this thing he will go out 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.280
 here she will give from additional 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230
 turnover that is faster to look out for 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.570
 there is air, that is, he should not go 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.269
 so bask as it is heated let's say 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.760
 now everything is suffering with it that is not 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.980
 Only here I have intel process hand howl 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.660
 processor md those in general probably 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.199
 boils because I had before 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 ppm 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.350
 surely there was boiling anyway in general 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.899
 let's start with this thing 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.760
 and we will finish with such cookies and 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.180
 left a box of cookies with 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.690
 algae that is a cookie wrapped 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 nori 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.560
 that is, sushi knows what the sea is 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.600
 so on construction and in general 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.750
 just impossibly standing here 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.820
 motor chick all such valves 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.380
 inside there probably not visible but they are there 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.979
 there we actually insert we 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.409
 The lattice of the laptop is this one with 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.399
 using this button here I am like this 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.439
 I squeeze this valve and then 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.610
 I let go, that is, it became and with the help 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.649
 here is this here we twist her like 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.240
 we press this thing closer to the laptop 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.200
 so that it does not hang out because I 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.960
 tried if she really 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.939
 dangles there will be a crash from the sound 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.340
 she is certainly not as quiet as us 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.100
 I would like to, but now I’ll give you all this 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.159
 I will show that I have a lattice more 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.899
 Much you see, but why this crap but I 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.570
 I leave it somewhere in the center 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.729
 after all she’s hanging out now 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.729
 these now unscrew 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:26.620
 all the way here, we do not hang out here 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:31.160
 extending a little wire and insert the yizbi 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.520
 immediately lit up the light went work sound 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.190
 I think you hear 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 well, of course well for louder than mine 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.150
 cooler in the laptop 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.450
 Yesterday I played the game 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.490
 here comes the hot air I will show you 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.350
 now a hole would have shown yes where 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.880
 damper hot air comes out of here 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.430
 how does a snail act so honestly 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.980
 say something laptop dropped damn on 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.250
 5-6 degrees is not, that is, using this 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.410
 things at 56 degrees it doesn't fall from 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.380
 using the program everest is all visible 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.380
 but degrees 2 3 I think she takes 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.750
 from here, well, that is, who has the khan there 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.100
 i.e. this thing may yes save you 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.570
 for me to see it is irrelevant 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.450
 Plato is she cool she glows 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.600
 in the dark cool that is such here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.459
 let her imagine there will be further by 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.830
 links have not been long send me these 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.200
 cookies I did not look looked at dac 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.390
 I think to try all the same as in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:47.540
 general until she reached it was all covered 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:51.250
 you see this by smell 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.250
 when plastic pancake 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:02.750
 it was included by the smell and 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.670
 reason damn what is either missing 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.970
 either there is too much rotten milk 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.110
 some kind of milky yet this 1 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.180
 definitely see some pancakes 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.810
 just folded processed first 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.100
 then folded and for better fixation 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.660
 secured with these sheets here legs i 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.680
 I do n't know how she is 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.680
 a taste to be delicious eat 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 try 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.600
 Slightly this hair is shorter to taste 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.430
 I just licked it to taste 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.430
 all the same it seems to me that she is already gone 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:55.180
 because what do you know if you take kefir 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.670
 but milky but unequivocally milky was 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:03.050
 But if we take kefir from a song 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.420
 in pancake and such kefir alina kefir but 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.560
 such a taste is not clear in general 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:14.000
 I won't eat 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.530
 try I do not know I do not want to fu damn either 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.110
 Well, I already have a package 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.090
 did not come about two months that is 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.040
 the form maybe she got spoiled 0 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.710
 eat eat cookies cookies for two months 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.430
 it does not deteriorate especially since it is not in the cold 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.170
 not damp well I do not know shorter not 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.670
 I recommend something else like this 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.430
 the plastics will be three was 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:40.850
 than shared such a cookie 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:44.510
 I strongly recommend you not like this 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.430
 here are 225 grams tags two boxes that is 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.830
 half a kilo I just getting throw out
