00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.050
 welcome guys back with a new set 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.790
 this time we will deal with me gaudino 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.890
 this pokémon that for many will be 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.780
 totally useless 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.110
 I must say that it is very nice so here it is 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.030
 at least it serves to make muds raise 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.700
 all the girls who will think of one 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.949
 dedication named gambino I can make a 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.529
 soft pillow to put under the 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.660
 bed 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.699
 no this was very sexist I ask 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.700
 humbly venerates to the girls in 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.770
 I listen without further delay I go to 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.250
 explain this set that is thought 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.950
 mainly for double fights 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.750
 it is a rom trick set by 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.250
 support 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.040
 then first of all I'll show you the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.130
 nature nature placid nature 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.950
 placid decreases speed precisely 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.020
 I put 0 ds in speed and zero vs in 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.510
 attack to prevent such moves 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.710
 pity and do damage and to make it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.440
 As soon as possible 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 in the sight area trick room is 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.540
 in fact the main one 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.970
 attack this set but then guys 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.960
 we have simple bim what is simple 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.660
 bimbe transforms into simple and skill 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.370
 of the simple target I remind you that it is 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.620
 a skill that doubles all the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.700
 status changes to statistics 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.210
 excuse me for some pokémon that in a few 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.120
 words if you are pregnant and you have 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 the simple skill will not increase them by 1 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.619
 the attack was speed but it will put you off 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.950
 two that is double 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.690
 if you curse, increase by 1 of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.060
 two the attack the defense because each 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.280
 doubled and decreased by two 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.250
 speed works so symbol 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.650
 now think of doing the tritium in the first one 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.190
 turn and the next turn to use 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.250
 simple pim on your same pokémon in 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.610
 this case another pokémon must be 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.330
 something or later that in fact it enhances the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.280
 statistics 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.890
 I think for example a pokémon as mentioned 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.050
 first with curse this 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 would allow it to grow disproportionately 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.310
 nothing on the head ate the words in 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.040
 really very few shifts then you can 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.049
 always treat it with the sial pulse if 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.220
 the bag to burn users ad 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.890
 example do these things 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.950
 I remind you that the killer skill of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.730
 audino denies with 30 percent of 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 chance will heal your ally 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.360
 from the changes of state 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.030
 and dancing 4 files to hit both 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.859
 opponents I remind you of the slim ones in one 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.689
 double fight affects all 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.879
 opponents 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.920
 considering that to 196 special attack 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.150
 it certainly won't do miracles though 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.959
 mica biscotti boys 196 desing lim un 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 nice 20 percent net both of them someone 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.389
 usually makes them at the pace that ai 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.200
 simple while chrome this set works 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.540
 so what to say 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.700
 I wanted to do a fight set in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.909
 double that somehow could 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.629
 make audino mega useful is different from 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.189
 other trick room setters in this case 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.379
 what makes it different and proper 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.120
 language symbol so if you have any 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.189
 pussy combo to be mated as a companion a 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.889
 do not hesitate this audino 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.480
 but the simple man oe remind you that 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.909
 symbolic also be used on 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.540
 opponents because you put that there is a 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:47.169
 that plame with the gust wings you exact 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.900
 simple bim made hi ale all'ir 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.200
 applied the atrix playmen will no longer have 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.930
 priority 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.930
 let's move on to the second set I propose 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.300
 in this video it is a narrow god 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.230
 for the fight in single very simple 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.349
 in reality I predict that they will audition mega 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.560
 will be in under used to say so much could 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.950
 even ending up in the hughes network 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.169
 so this tightens a bit a variant 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.690
 of the dialogue set the kind of audino 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.970
 I remind you that it is a normal sprite e 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.530
 therefore with few weaknesses 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.200
 the only weakness he has are those of the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.669
 type elf for the kind of fight he is 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040
 the weakness of the normal type comes 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.400
 covered by the elf so weak 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.180
 solely to the steel type and type 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 poison and at this point since i 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.700
 toxic does not work on the type ciaio on 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.760
 poison type I with the last omitted move 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.470
 croff but you could very well put 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.380
 something that at least type system 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.620
 poison t box to the psychic strike which 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.330
 learn both remind you however put it 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.880
 brno kof because it is good or bad is a 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.160
 utility move that works a little 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.650
 against all yes to the beautiful 4 game you get 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.880
 toxic to poison right and miss e 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.010
 wish because it is joined to the good 410 ps vi 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.760
 allows you to recover life or 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.200
 to desire another god 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.990
 your allies 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.970
 that is to say here instead of a killer I remember you 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.140
 useless because it is uniquely a 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.340
 unlucky hate fight unfortunately it is 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.920
 the other side is a product of 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.080
 last step minute medal that 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.520
 I propose is a set 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.390
 the rest and I must say that this is mine 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.060
 opinion in the suit of the lowest etr 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.850
 would do massacres because they really are 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.970
 few pokémon able to send ko 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:52.070
 this case I explain myself with the maximum 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:55.910
 of defense 386 of defense 410 of ps 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.070
 this thing with rest and slip talk 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.200
 it really gets to be thrown down 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.780
 after a single calm beyond what 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.780
 special arrives 420d open up sky like 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.030
 make to throw it down after some calm 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.160
 dating she begins to do damage 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.500
 so it's very simple when calm 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.980
 little life comes rest then I am the lia 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.720
 I remind you that I am the one I rest 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.520
 Doing will be documented as people do 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.470
 two shifts so do up morals and for 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.200
 two shifts novi equipment was wrong 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.010
 for sure you don't make me calm implies 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.220
 what you want 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.080
 and in short, in my opinion, this set can 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.080
 being can really cause gods 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.380
 I said problems in the lower lands 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.880
 don't use it on the highest lands 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.470
 guys because it's a mega matt gross 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.850
 this audino veil eats anyway 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.660
 any me enjoy veil eat a 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.530
 breakfast with much taste among other things 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.170
 I think I gave everything 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:52.730
 I hope you enjoyed these topics if 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:55.280
 do you have any pokémon to add to 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.620
 this set for double maybe sincere 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.970
 tarpaulin comments we will see you at 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.840
 next mega set 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.840
 Hi guys
