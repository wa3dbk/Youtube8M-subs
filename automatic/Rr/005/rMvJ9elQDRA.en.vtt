00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
 ah 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.129
 Hello, how are you good? 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 makes a video but it really shortens the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.640
 dog and ironing me then I wanted to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 take advantage of the ironing of the hair 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.250
 to make the video then good 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.090
 today we are going to talk about a question that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.910
 they do me a lot 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.530
 I do not know why they do not take like this several 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.170
 people ask me the same thing I 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.780
 I think it's a very common doubt and that's why 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.380
 is going to treat the video is that so bad 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.380
 is the nutella 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 well then how badly do I nutella 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240
 I think this question asks me a lot 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.190
 why 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.020
 Today there are so many foods so there 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.310
 to choose always ask me what 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.550
 is wrong in the nutella then I think 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.590
 which is because it's so delicious that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.410
 they feel that they have to be the worst 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.390
 not because something so rich does not 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.750
 it can not be legal then 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.450
 let's see as well as objectively 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.729
 come out 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.549
 this a portion of nutella or of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 chocolate hazelnut butter flavor 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 which are the portion are two tablespoons 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.070
 has 200 calories has 2 grams of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 protein 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 and 23 grams of carbohydrates and 11 grams 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.979
 of fat then compared for example 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 with peanut butter or 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 peanut butter 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.770
 this is the peanut butter has more 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.240
 or less the same calories 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.869
 but it has 8 grams of protein 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 of 6 grams of carbohydrates and has a 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.520
 little more fat has 16 grams of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.480
 fat then what does this mean not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.310
 I know how bad it is 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.980
 for example it feels like it's a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.480
 serving of two tablespoons are 200 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 calories that are more or less the 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.900
 calories they have I do not know four 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.320
 tortillas let's see let's base 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.320
 in that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.190
 for example you how is a spoonful 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.910
 that would be 100 calories is not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.790
 comparable to a teaspoon of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.460
 of olive oil one tablespoon per 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.260
 example if they make a diet they use 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.349
 well the equivalences so that one 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.790
 thank you and so on a spoonful of 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.150
 nutella because it was being like a 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.170
 equivalence of 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.940
 if then it is bad 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 well I do not like to classify much 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.010
 in food as well as that in good 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.930
 and bad in forbidden truth 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.000
 because it makes me feel like that 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.640
 a mentality so very white and black 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.049
 that can make you obsess 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.210
 so that's not how it is 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.180
 very 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.470
 very father then to me what I like 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.270
 to do is like that to divide me 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.150
 food as well as that 80 by 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.210
 percent that is healthy and 20 percent like that 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.050
 like we say "antojitos" 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.100
 for example 80 percent that is healthy 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.250
 It would be like this because I do not know the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.710
 fruits vegetables whole grains 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.820
 lean protein 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.720
 water and 20% of snacks as you can 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.100
 be finished the nutella 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.100
 I do not know the chocolates 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.129
 gelatin I do not know what you like as well 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.329
 to eat well of snacks that is not 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.350
 like that very natural 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:36.250
 let's put it that way naturally and then 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.980
 very natural or very healthy then yes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.470
 you can consider the fabric as that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.100
 within this 20% because then it has a 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.390
 considerable amount of sugar acidity and 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.430
 of fat 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
 then I would consider it within myself 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.290
 20% how this is handled or does not want 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.510
 say as well as this is the forbidden 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.780
 and this is what is so legal not 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.700
 but that 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.280
 20 percent is like what is 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.650
 you have to eat more moderately if you 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.569
 can do two ways can it be like this 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.500
 I eat daily what I do 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.940
 for example this that 80% daily 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.450
 of my diet is like that of 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.720
 this lush side and 20% is what this 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.260
 side for example today I had breakfast 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.010
 liquefied that had strawberry strawberries oats 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.200
 almonds and serves the space I'm going to 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.330
 eat I do not know a salad and I'm going to 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.210
 have a yogurt with fruit 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.160
 for example that's my 80 percent and my 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.520
 20 percent then in the afternoon maybe 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.690
 go to the movies and I bought myself a chocolate and 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.040
 some popcorn that was my 20% 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.630
 so I like to do it to myself 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.430
 like to do it everyday other people what 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.610
 they do like weekly that also 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.920
 you can from Monday to Friday as in 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.120
 as well as that very strict and it is so super 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.030
 all right 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.220
 and the weekend they go as well as that 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 one or two days when they eat what they eat 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.979
 be for example that breakfast I do not know 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.540
 some hot cakes with nutella and eat 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.750
 a hamburger and if they have wings 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.210
 for example then it can be done is 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.880
 in your daily or weekly forms to me 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.980
 Personally, I prefer to do so 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.510
 daily or like a little snack 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.639
 smaller makes my three meals 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.939
 daily so healthy 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.800
 and smaller than smaller 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.780
 weekly because weekly I feel 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.940
 that lends itself more to 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.889
 to become obsessed and just like you are 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.470
 with truth so that no, well , I already 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.360
 I performed super well from Monday to Friday and the 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.370
 Saturday I'm going to give myself a super mega 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.270
 tascÃ³n so of everything that I like and in 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.860
 large quantities 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.680
 that's why I do not like to do it 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.540
 like this from Monday to Friday but well 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.340
 total anyway to everyone who 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.560
 Different things work for each person 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.060
 It's different and what works for me 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.639
 Well, it does not have to teach you 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:05.240
 but yes then my point was that 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.150
 maybe he knows if he has sinned and the worst 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.460
 the most delicious but not bone nutella 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.860
 it's not forbidden nor is it the worst 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.520
 you can eat in fact or you have your 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.580
 good things this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.120
 has the healthy fats of the 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.340
 hazelnuts 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.380
 gives you energy or is very good 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.150
 if I do not know for example at breakfast a 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.800
 toast with a spoonful of nutella 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.300
 because if you have a contribution asia 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.389
 energetic 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.979
 high and then they have chocolate that already 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.440
 they have accidents and apart knows well 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.460
 like a hug that you eat is not something 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.540
 so delicious 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.120
 so 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.710
 as a conclusion do not obsess there is no 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.330
 good food bad foods 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.160
 there are simply foods that we have 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.639
 to eat more moderately than others 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.189
 there are no prohibited foods 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.469
 Well I so if there is anything that is in 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.659
 seriously I think they have also asked me 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:59.699
 much that is the worst so the worst thing that 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.960
 you can eat in life I think there's 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.469
 if you come making the cheese of the 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.379
 nachos because that is, here is fat 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:10.319
 painted yellow completely 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.569
 artificial and so I think that being 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.520
 worst 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:18.259
 but obviously without growth with the 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.539
 many and nothing happens if that is 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:23.629
 have a healthy mentality 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.520
 about what we eat and not see the 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.619
 things like that so black and white 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.809
 so if you fancy the mountain the 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.339
 as an armpit and take care of the portion nothing 

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:33.110
 more obviously you're not going to sit like that 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.899
 watch movies with a bottle of nutella and 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.840
 a spoon true but yes or a 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:40.949
 spoonful nothing happens 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.949
 and well that was all
