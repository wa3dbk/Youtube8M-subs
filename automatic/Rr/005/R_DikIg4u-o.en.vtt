00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
what's going on in the world and i think

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.889 
what's going on in the world and i think
the<00:00:57.680> palestinian-israeli<00:00:59.270> situation<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.390> one

the palestinian-israeli situation is one

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.970 
the palestinian-israeli situation is one
of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> most<00:01:01.109> pressing<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
of the most pressing and I think it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.119 
of the most pressing and I think it's
something<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> hopefully<00:01:02.940> students<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
something that hopefully students and

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.899 
something that hopefully students and
potentially<00:01:05.129> suits<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.400> birthday<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> our

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
potentially suits from birthday and our

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.310 
potentially suits from birthday and our
generation<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.630> able<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> work<00:01:07.020> toward
