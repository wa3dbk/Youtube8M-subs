00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello friends with you now he is 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 44th edition heading master on all tanks 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 the heading in which I'm trying to get 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 mark of klassnosti master technique 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.410
 the names of which you specify in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.640
 comments 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.769
 I remind you that in the description of this video 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 There is a list of tanks that have already been 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 received a mark of class master therefore 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 before you write your name 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.450
 candidate please take a look at this 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.100
 list 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 today we will have a little rest from the middle and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.750
 heavy tanks i remember ppsh 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.969
 I have repeatedly said that this eye 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.500
 technology opinion especially like but not 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.300
 less there are individual representatives 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.629
 which I like 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 today I will tell about one of them 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 Jagdtigr German Pt -Sau ninth level 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 often the name of this tank flashed 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 in the comments and today finally 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.329
 it's his time now I'm with 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.379
 I am pleased to tell you about it the Germans 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 dating as usual begin with 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.610
 specifications unfortunately 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
 good dynamics yagtigr boast not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 maybe the car is pretty heavy seventy 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 more than five tons and the engine just 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.549
 only 700 horsepower that means that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 fast acceleration and turn on the spot 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.170
 we can not see though the maximum speed 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.869
 forward pretty good 38 kilometers in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.700
 whole hour by. Of course it is rather slow 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 full time but if we consider that we have 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 quite good booking then with such 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.000
 dynamics can be tolerated I already feel 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.070
 your desire to quickly write in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 comments that yagis have no armor and and and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 everyone punches but guys this is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 wrong in this n very good frontal 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.979
 the armor just needs to be able to use 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.320
 but unfortunately for this there is not always 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.010
 opportunity to tank on our 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.930
 Germans need to hide the bottom 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.450
 preferably upper armor sheet showing 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.120
 the enemy only has a wheelhouse in which 250 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.590
 millimeters nld armored very weak 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.900
 there are only 100 millimeters 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.150
 even some tanks pierce it 7 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.070
 level and very often these penetration 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.140
 going engine script what are you already 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 could make sure if you haven't 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 repair kit jagdtir turns into 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.369
 real turtles with top armor sheet 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.410
 things are a little better there 150 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.450
 millimeters under a good slope on 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.220
 medium range during welling 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.220
 corps you can easily beat the shells 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.470
 from tanks level 8 but if the enemy 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.550
 breaking through 240 millimeters then 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.440
 almost always 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.170
 it is guaranteed to be applied to you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.940
 damage since our pt is not the fastest 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.340
 then she certainly enjoys increased 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.450
 attention in abortion artillery thick 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.820
 80 millimeters 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.900
 very often takes top shell 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.730
 art with full damage 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.010
 it must be borne in mind and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.660
 stay in hiding otherwise you 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.880
 risk going to the hangar with one 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.770
 suitcase and so if we talk about 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.630
 booking in general, something against a dozen 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.910
 She certainly would not help you though 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.010
 sometimes happens but here being on top 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.900
 list tank can be quite good for 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.489
 at least until opponents 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
 will not start using premium 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.650
 shells further talk about guns 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.570
 I personally liked it very much 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.370
 Grandma's great break in two hundred 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.530
 seventy six millimeters allows 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.209
 punch almost any way if u 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.620
 you have any problems you can 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.290
 use subcaliber with a break 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.910
 three hundred fifty two millimeters at the gun 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.050
 excellent accuracy spread over 100 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.000
 meters 033 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.170
 and comfortable time information two whole 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.180
 three tenths of a second 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.730
 as this pt does not have rotating 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.380
 the tower then the angles of horizontal guidance 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.250
 it is limited but quite 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.040
 quite good 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.720
 10 degrees and 10 degrees to the left and right 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.810
 as for the corners of the vertical guidance 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.650
 then they are 7 degrees down and 15 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.930
 degrees up 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.150
 reloading gun with rammer will 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.320
 take about 10 half seconds a 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690
 full body kit 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.360
 it will be only 9 that allows 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.489
 have a very good dpf sometime 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.410
 Yagi cannon was really unique 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.350
 she combined excellent accuracy 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.780
 probe 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.940
 etc. but with the advent of waffentrager 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.980
 level nine is almost exactly 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.510
 the same tool many players thought that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.090
 Jagdar is no longer needed 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.490
 I personally hold the opinion that these two 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.590
 completely different and says that one of 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.750
 they are better and the other is not worse bark 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.060
 because it all depends on preferences and 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.490
 player someone more like to sit in 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.650
 bushes ambush and shoot at someone else's 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.630
 light up for such gameplay of course 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.730
 Vaffenturger is better because 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.100
 he has excellent disguise and not 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.109
 has no armor me such gameplay 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.769
 not so happy so I choose 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.630
 Jagdar 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.850
 if you wish, it is also possible 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.310
 stand in the bushes and shoot at 500 meters 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.140
 but at the same time if you are in the top then 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.240
 you can act quite actively 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.790
 especially if this city map 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 I really appreciate this choice 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.080
 gameplay and so i like yaga 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.840
 much more even though 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.390
 she has a very bad disguise but 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.580
 this barn a good overview of 390 meters 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 that the light of the recent nerf of this 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.120
 indicator in some fri-sau 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.850
 taxes you activate one small 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.860
 advantage in general to argue about what 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.810
 both this is the best needed is inactive or not 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.810
 need basically useless because 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.389
 each player will stay with his 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.550
 I liked Jagdigr and my 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.590
 Look right now is quite relevant but 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.700
 if it suddenly decides apnut I certainly 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.610
 I will not mind 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.590
 by the way what do you think I need GIAP 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.540
 or so come write about it in 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.090
 I am very interested in the comments that you 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.950
 think about it but as for 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.930
 getting a master then with this no 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.360
 I had no problems recently 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.669
 pumped berry on your account and 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.070
 for all the time I got probably eight pieces 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.560
 masters and this fight was the first in a row 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.389
 in the top and as I said earlier you can 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.250
 this act rather active than 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.200
 I actually first and do first 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.940
 we went allies push one 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.220
 direction and then had to 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.919
 return to base defense and finish off 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.310
 all invader so if not stand in 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.870
 bushes 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.790
 and act on the front line 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.820
 opportunities then get a master not 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.740
 no trouble on this i have 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.169
 for today all thanks for your attention 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.970
 with you was now he subscribe to 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.680

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.680
 on my channel to new meetings
