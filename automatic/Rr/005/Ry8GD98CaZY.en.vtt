00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
fake the other night so that was

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.859 
fake the other night so that was
interesting<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.650> see<00:01:03.830> all<00:01:04.339> right<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:05.000> even

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
interesting to see all right so you even

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.630 
interesting to see all right so you even
if<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.049> was<00:01:06.140> fake<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.530> find<00:01:06.799> like<00:01:07.130> why<00:01:07.310> would<00:01:07.520> you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
if it was fake I find like why would you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.130 
if it was fake I find like why would you
tell<00:01:07.850> me<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.180> was<00:01:08.329> fake<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:08.570> I'll<00:01:08.780> give<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
tell me it was fake so I'll give you the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.200 
tell me it was fake so I'll give you the
chance<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.590> sort<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.860> prove<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.280> how<00:01:10.970> many

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
chance to sort of prove this how many

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.670 
chance to sort of prove this how many
attempts<00:01:11.780> did<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.110> have<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.290> make<00:01:12.439> on<00:01:12.650> that

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
attempts did you have to make on that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.399 
attempts did you have to make on that
shot<00:01:13.130> before<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.610> fell<00:01:13.820> will<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> timber<00:01:15.350> we

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
shot before it fell will be a timber we

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.110 
shot before it fell will be a timber we
didn't<00:01:15.620> actually<00:01:15.740> count<00:01:16.070> each<00:01:16.340> attempt<00:01:16.909> but

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
didn't actually count each attempt but

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.660 
didn't actually count each attempt but
we<00:01:17.240> know<00:01:17.420> total<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.530> took<00:01:18.650> us<00:01:18.770> about<00:01:18.980> two<00:01:19.280> hours

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
we know total it took us about two hours

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.550 
we know total it took us about two hours
you<00:01:20.000> know<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.180> set<00:01:20.540> up<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.870> actually<00:01:20.960> film<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
you know to set up and actually film the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.000 
you know to set up and actually film the
shot<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.920> everything<00:01:22.840> we<00:01:23.840> pulled<00:01:24.440> up<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.860> we

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
shot and everything we pulled up and we

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.410 
shot and everything we pulled up and we
first<00:01:25.430> didn't<00:01:25.760> even<00:01:25.850> think<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.120> could<00:01:26.210> make<00:01:26.390> it

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
first didn't even think we could make it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.760 
first didn't even think we could make it
from<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.690> third<00:01:26.870> deck<00:01:27.080> because<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.530> looked<00:01:27.710> so

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
from the third deck because it looked so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.280 
from the third deck because it looked so
far<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.550> we<00:01:29.450> went<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.780> second<00:01:30.140> deck

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
far and so we went to the second deck

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.230 
far and so we went to the second deck
and<00:01:30.470> tried<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:31.460> ended<00:01:31.760> up<00:01:31.880> thinking

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
and tried one and then ended up thinking

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.520 
and tried one and then ended up thinking
that<00:01:32.360> we<00:01:32.450> could<00:01:32.570> do<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.810> from<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.050> third<00:01:33.290> and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
that we could do it from the third and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.140 
that we could do it from the third and
so<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.650> went<00:01:33.830> up<00:01:33.920> there<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.220> threw<00:01:34.400> one<00:01:34.580> off<00:01:34.790> and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
so I went up there and threw one off and

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.510 
so I went up there and threw one off and
we<00:01:36.140> figured<00:01:36.440> probably<00:01:36.770> about<00:01:36.890> total<00:01:37.310> shooting

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
we figured probably about total shooting

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.310 
we figured probably about total shooting
time<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.180> actually<00:01:38.479> me<00:01:38.600> shooting<00:01:38.840> shots<00:01:39.170> was

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
time of actually me shooting shots was

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.350 
time of actually me shooting shots was
about<00:01:39.560> 30<00:01:39.830> minutes<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:40.880> that's<00:01:41.030> where<00:01:41.210> we're

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
about 30 minutes so that's where we're

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.180 
about 30 minutes so that's where we're

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
and we was just me and Sean and we

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.170 
and we was just me and Sean and we
didn't<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.830> camera<00:03:55.040> guy<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:56.000> set

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
didn't have a camera guy and so we set

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.640 
didn't have a camera guy and so we set
up<00:03:56.209> two<00:03:56.450> chairs<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.959> we<00:03:57.019> set<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.320> camera<00:03:57.620> up

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
up two chairs and we set the camera up

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.410 
up two chairs and we set the camera up
on<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> railing<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.940> happened<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.299> be

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
on the railing and it happened to be

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.910 
on the railing and it happened to be
perfectly<00:03:59.870> centered<00:04:00.170> around<00:04:00.440> us<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:00.830> we

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
perfectly centered around us so we

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.650 
perfectly centered around us so we
didn't<00:04:01.100> even<00:04:01.190> have<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.459> touch<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.090> so

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
didn't even have to touch it and so

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.660 
didn't even have to touch it and so
that's<00:04:02.989> what<00:04:03.260> led<00:04:03.290> Sean<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.830> say<00:04:03.980> dude<00:04:04.190> perfect

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.800 
that's what led Sean to say dude perfect
and<00:04:04.820> that's<00:04:04.940> where<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> name<00:04:05.330> came<00:04:05.540> from
