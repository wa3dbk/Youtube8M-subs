he found was that the cancer was slow

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.720 
he found was that the cancer was slow
moving<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.170> essence<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.769> had<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.489> thing

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
moving so in essence i had the one thing

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.490 
moving so in essence i had the one thing
that<00:00:32.759> every<00:00:33.059> cancer<00:00:33.270> patient<00:00:33.780> longs<00:00:34.290> for

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that every cancer patient longs for

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
that every cancer patient longs for
which<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.130> time<00:00:35.600> but<00:00:36.600> again<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:37.140> no<00:00:37.200> cure

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
which is time but again there's no cure

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.299 
which is time but again there's no cure
so<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:39.120> said<00:00:39.360> let's<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.170> watch<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.920> wait

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
so he said let's do a watch and wait

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000 
so he said let's do a watch and wait
approach<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.750> i<00:00:42.870> didn't<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
approach and i didn't know what that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430 
approach and i didn't know what that
meant<00:00:44.190> i<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.700> ain't<00:00:45.030> watching<00:00:45.899> wait<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
meant i do it ain't watching wait so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.040 
meant i do it ain't watching wait so
instead<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.800> decided<00:00:46.950> watch<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.730> live<00:00:48.050> forget

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
