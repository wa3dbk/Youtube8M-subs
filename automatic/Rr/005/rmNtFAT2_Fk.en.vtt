there as seen on TV section when I saw
this<00:00:19.619> brush<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.130> thought<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.910> perfect<00:00:21.480> for

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this brush I thought it's perfect for

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.300 
this brush I thought it's perfect for
this<00:00:21.840> person<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:23.100> she

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
this person right here because she

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
this person right here because she
always<00:00:23.550> has<00:00:23.880> trouble<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> tangles<00:00:25.230> in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
always has trouble with the tangles in

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
always has trouble with the tangles in
the<00:00:25.439> hair<00:00:25.680> no<00:00:26.130> matter<00:00:26.310> which<00:00:26.550> brush<00:00:26.820> she<00:00:27.029> tries

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the hair no matter which brush she tries

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109 
the hair no matter which brush she tries
it<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:28.140> ends<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.800> being<00:00:28.859> very<00:00:29.220> painful<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it just ends up being very painful and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.759 
it just ends up being very painful and
when<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.359> painful<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.810> don't<00:00:31.170> brush<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.590> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
when it's painful you don't brush it you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
when it's painful you don't brush it you
don't<00:00:32.130> brush<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:33.030> more<00:00:33.059> tangles<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
don't brush it you get more tangles and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.270 
don't brush it you get more tangles and
so<00:00:34.050> that's<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> cycle<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.040> through

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so that's the cycle we go through

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.180 
so that's the cycle we go through
regularly<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.320> pain-free<00:00:37.320> untangling

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
regularly so this pain-free untangling

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
regularly so this pain-free untangling
brush<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.640> thought<00:00:38.820> might<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
brush I thought might really do the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
brush I thought might really do the
trick<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.469> 15<00:00:40.890> dollars<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.460> I'll

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
trick it was about 15 dollars and I'll

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.950
