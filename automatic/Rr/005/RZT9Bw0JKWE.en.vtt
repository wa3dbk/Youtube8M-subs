 Iñaki Williams and Mr. Konoplyanka 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.580
 gentlemen two of the most requested players 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.470
 for all of you in all the rest 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
 episodes before anything before I 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.160
 ask for more players and others but the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 two previous videos uploaded to the channel 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.260
 in the new skiles and the first 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 episode new players and this time 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.560
 second episode of new players 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.750
 but in reality they are ghost players 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 what does this mean and what does it mean 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 this episode where are you going to see that no 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.899
 none have these statistics and how 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
 I'm going to find out what average they have in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
 reality because this I will explain 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 now but first of all you already know new 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.170
 design for the miniatures and the letters 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 so that they look much better 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.980
 now they are much better made 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 letters and thank you again thank you again 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 make a test that was the one that got the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 run to improve a little more this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.900
 which is the one that helps me the designer that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.690
 Help me seriously 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.560
 I did not know how to thank him at all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.480
 that is a tremendous effort that I 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.340
 has given an impressive hand in this 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.900
 and without him it would not have been possible 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 information videos I only provide one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 information and others and he then you're 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 Currado are awesome so nothing 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.850
 I hope you leave a supportive thee 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 for the work that leads to this and come 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.060
 we go there as I know they have these 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.250
 half these players that I'm going to draw 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 because with these players I call them 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.450
 ghost players because because they come out 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 in the beta when you are going to look for a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 player and you're going to put the name of that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 player in the search for a 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.910
 conceptual template or looked for the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.410
 market goes out the player comes out with the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.970
 mean but when you give it to look at 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.310
 conceptual template or in the market you 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.680
 says there are no results what leads 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.360
 is this where you 're just going to see the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.479
 half that goes to the right of the name 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.510
 but since the letter does not come out, you do not know if 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.450
 have you can not know the statistics 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.180
 nor the position of the player only knows 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.310
 that the player is obviously and only 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.290
 know your average then what are we going to do 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.540
 in this episode I want that today 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.640
 and you the protagonists of this 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.410
 episode today I want you to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.420
 say in the comments that you put 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.680
 for example the first player is going to be 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.430
 so and zeballos that you put dandy 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.390
 Ceballos two points and put position and 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 the position that you think rhythm shot all 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 the statistics and then skills I want 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 see everything you have of these 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.230
 players and you have seen them play and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.240
 I want to know why 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.020
 statistics I will put you and you to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.450
 these players 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.250
 the stockings the average because you will have to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.660
 choose characteristics in the position of 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.000
 same because it does not influence the average but 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.470
 yes statistics that they go with 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 with the average you will not go to lessons that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.030
 zeballos with 67 media then he will have 90 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.560
 and I throw 90 of rhythm and others because 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.290
 I would hit a lot then I want to know 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.670
 what would your opinions be about 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.890
 of these statistics as I tell you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.660
 they are players that come out in the beta and for 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.820
 I bring them that but as only the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.980
 mean I do not bring you with the media and 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.870
 have among all of you to see if 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.280
 when they do 16 to see if there are any 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.140
 who manages to guess this then 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.680
 we started as they say dan and zeballos 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.020
 the espanyol the betis player a 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.760
 player who has done a very good very 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.820
 good campaign and I wonder just you 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.860
 come out with 66 on average is something quite 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.750
 but how pretty and weird that he has so 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.400
 little average in the beta but good is a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.290
 game that you can not even try 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.550
 control in the market since it only comes out 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.590
 the name but it is not even in 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.260
 conceptual so as I say 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.030
 participate in the comments and 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.800
 say what statistics would you put and I 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.450
 personally I have not seen any matches 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.440
 from cevallos so I could not comment 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.330
 but 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.280
 I already tell you that I will read each and every one 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.080
 of your opinions the following 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.620
 player we have to konoplyanka here what 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.370
 we have 81 player average 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.990
 sevilla does not say in the position either 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.640
 although I think that with obvious here I think 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.100
 it will be half left or far left 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.220
 who are the ones who used to play the most 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.870
 skills since I may have 4 to 5 yo 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.180
 He is a player that I have seen several videos 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.920
 of him before making the video of this 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.170
 own video and I have seen that it is very good 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.730
 doing dribbling so from 4 to 5 could 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.740
 have although I think it will put it in 4 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.530
 not only does the player is a player 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.330
 so easily 5 of skills in this 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.650
 over so I guess it will put you in 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.500
 4 but it's a player who could also 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.440
 have 5 perfectly the one that highlights the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.760
 speed and uncle but to know what 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.520
 statistic they are going to put that yes 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.080
 it's 81 on average so it will be a 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.610
 pretty pretty good statistics 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.110
 because a player with 81 on average already 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.490
 has some is after pretty 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.660
 pretty good so nothing too that 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.280
 let's see what you think of 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.650
 konoplyanka what position you would put 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.230
 how many skills and what statistics 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.080
 would you put in each of those that has the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.030
 rhythm shot pass physical head or knows 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.890
 physical forgiveness dribling 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.080
 what would you say you do not know 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.760
 in the comments and finally we have 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.250
 to another of the most requested players 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
 iñaki williams everything looks like it will be 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.560
 a silver che all the year that comes in 73 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.610
 on average I suppose it will be 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.280
 bright silver letter iñaki wilians 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.680
 I personally tell you I have not seen 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.570
 neither Iñaki game but I know 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.670
 that you follow me many followers of 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.400
 athletic club of bilbao so you 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.070
 you will be the ones who best understand what 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.980
 position and what statistics would this 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.170
 letter as you see is average 73 or silver 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.420
 bright and also to guess 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.340
 how many skills would this player have 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.070
 so nothing in this episode like ya 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.200
 I say I need your contribution 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.180
 you are the protagonists as well 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.820
 say what we will try to unveil 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.830
 his statistics as are players I 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.720
 they will be players who did not have raised 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.370
 bring because they are players that you can not 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.890
 see the letter but very many 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.600
 you ask me these players and as I say 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.250
 only things go out and they did not go out to the 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.870
 beta neither media nor anything would not bring 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.969
 but the media comes out or is something that 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.429
 it can be brought 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.559
 the letters are healed and finally you see everything 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:02.229
 perfect the menu the miniature and other has 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.939
 quite quite top and as 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.529
 I tell you all this effort is nothing 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.999
 yesterday he did not have much support which is the 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.619
 of new kilos if you have not seen them 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.119

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.079
 ghosts are this is this because they are 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:40.089
 players that were asking me for a 

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:42.519
 but I already have a lot of 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:45.939
 players like for example send as 

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:48.399
 for example many many many 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.739

 planned planned also upload 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.100
 videos with players where you already 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.080
 exist in fifa 15 but they have 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.610
 gone up pretty or that look like 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.230
 be quite cited or that there 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.580
 tested and they are sitting too 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.500
 deal with that which is something that many 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.030
 you ask but first I want to focus on 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.530
 the new players then we'll go in 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.760
 the games that most seem 80 2 in the 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.470
 powers that have seemed good to me and 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.090
 but first let's focus on
