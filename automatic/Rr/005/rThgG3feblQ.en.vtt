00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello good evening to you all and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 welcome in addition to the tutorial where I'm going 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 you learn how to properly hold a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
 table tennis racket of this type 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.880
 we can see from the beginning who has a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.710
 black side and a red side 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.750
 simply because the black side 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 adhere more than the red side 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.730
 we will use the black hit 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 basically to make setbacks 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 because in fact it is to balance 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 the force between the forehand and in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.490
 setback 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 because we usually do not have 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.689
 force with the forehand you with the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 backhand so it just serves to balance 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.210
 the costs so we'll start with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.860
 our racket red side facing us on 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.559
 will take pau space between the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.719
 thumb and index finger and come the plated on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.870
 this arc here is going to give you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.180
 something of this type 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.379
 then you just have to stick 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 your index like these and it is necessary that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 the racket only hold with the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 thumb and forefinger it must be able 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.430
 to be stable good here then he we 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 just stay to shoot a little bit 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 racket like this as soon as she is a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 little fingers so that the little 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 skin I mentioned earlier 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.909
 do not touch the wood has arrived in 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 this position there is more than in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.340
 wanted the fingers on the racket 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 here is a position 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.570
 comfortable to put your fingers together if 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.670
 necessary because if we are like that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's going to be very unbearable but we 're going 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.369
 quickly weary 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 that it draws far too much on the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.290
 articulations so we see we must have 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 a relative catch that leaves 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.170
 the amplitude we see there like that we'll have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 good wrist maneuverability and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.369
 could as well make effects 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.229
 like that flat setbacks and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.700
 straight shots flat 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.990
 so that's going to become 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 instinctive you will be able to take the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 racket 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 the flu is directly you will 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.770
 directly the good catch it goes quickly 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.090
 become instinctive but for the five 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 first time for example it will take 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.100
 to practice doing this gesture 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.229
 loop to take your racket 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.900
 several times before starting a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.570
 match 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.810
 So here I hope I have helped 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.810
 soon
