00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.180
 as usual and make a block but 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 that almost take the camera record it and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 after the hairstyle looks I'm in pajamas 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 so that because I have done this is going to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.590
 be a blog patatero but even if 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.789
 patatero does not mean that there is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.300
 tropos information I'll tell you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.300
 also with her 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.350
 boxing because I just bought the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 fifa 15 because this one because we do not 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.969
 they did raise in plan there until copaco 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.170
 something maybe I will go up but I had 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 really want to play it 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 this quite a super house keys 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.109
 I think it's going to be 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.009
 a chair 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.700
 also some teams are there because 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.060
 you will see my reaction is complicated in the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.060
 careers 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.569
 fifa 15 that as you said 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:43.030
 the game was very nice kind of little to 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.270
 little already lacks the last the last of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.270
 these 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.270
 and here we have everything flow and also work 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.710
 for pursue the case I already have shipments of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.560
 call of duty and uploaded I will publish it 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.690
 later I also have two cams 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.680
 fix it on that I recorded and one I have uploaded 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.730
 just on Saturday if it is not 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.930
 know this video well why I 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.580
 it comes out a bit but good 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.070
 the case comes after seeing something more than 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.040
 variety as it has been obviously not 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.870
 is going to be now in point plan mornings 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.700
 there was a study video of this a 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.800
 video of this and gt5 down the pace 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.360
 card tone 5 same as always 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.410
 simply that the videos these games 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.910
 extra videos or the best is to say with 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.770
 the same the same exactly the same 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.510
 rhythm that came from video in five 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 I'm even thinking of uploading some 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.140
 Latin schedule since I have a lot of 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.760
 Latino supporters are supporting me and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.709
 I am one of the most supportive and I have my 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.100
 little heart and I'm thinking about going up 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.290
 plan a video not every day because if 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.360
 He has still killed but if he reaches 30 and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
 also in Latin time and apart from 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.780
 all that then an extra video and the plan 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.370
 of these games it costs to have to yes 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.390
 that in the end it's very hard for me 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.769
 I have to lose there in plan that if 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.769
 recording video I enjoy 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.310
 15 that complements it to record it and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.299
 upload it mainly because a game 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.530
 that I love especially good for 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.209
 playing with my brother that we make 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.340
 there's a kind of playoffs very, very 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.260
 cool and we had a great by 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.400
 certain the rescue we have this what is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 tim create your own team 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.820
 its little now some code around here for 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.820
 Instruction cases 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.860
 basically tell you that maybe 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.870
 It leaves me with this because it is very 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.709
 entertaining and there are people who simply 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.480
 is girded to see gta iv does not stop or to 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.830
 try to watch a video of this and I 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.940
 I recommend that there is because they are mine 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.340
 that only remains very dear are 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.340
 Variety quite variety and good
