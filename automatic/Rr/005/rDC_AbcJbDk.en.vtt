00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.670
 people today we take the breath of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.440
 inspire with us if you are interested 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 possibly know the system corners and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 other accumulators can put off 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.020
 because we think it's a bit extreme 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 expensive 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.279
 Maybe we can do it that way 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.510
 We first tried that partly 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 I've already done that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.490
 in the following video you will see how 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 the whole story disassembled 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 I say that is very easy and must 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.719
 you book the clips here they are solved 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 here are still here 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.739
 locked and there so once little 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.270
 around like solve cancer and to safety 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.399
 I would read in any case, that here 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:04.019
 the country for the control not that he 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:08.030
 the battery then activates a wiped 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:21.990
 get every now and instead must we this 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 screw four pieces I do too 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.299
 only because of that the cables 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.299
 relieve a bit 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 then you have the frame here 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:45.020
 the clip then just that 's it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.030
 beautiful 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.799
 then we have here there is an indicator 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.350
 trend I think that an indicator 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.270
 when the liquid comes in order 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.399
 Guarantee loamy so the little white 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 The thing is probably good 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.350
 I will be starting normal indicator 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.009
 just suspend and then it works 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.570
 actually continue then must here 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.570
 replace this cover here 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:28.590
 she just glued the inspire 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:49.480
 accumulators all before us again 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:54.040
 to break down what is behind it 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.550
 So logical board is built like 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.440
 the accumulators, so to speak, of each other 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.180
 You can now be connected here completely 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.380
 nice to see 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.959
 there are always two couples the one 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.660
 Accumulator also in control 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:17.950
 Show and then we have it there 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.980
 that's this ntc that's one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.800
 Temperature sensor is created here 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.420
 if that brings some questions I would know 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.950
 it really is present in one place 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.970
 actually put that in the middle now 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.440
 you do not just have to be there 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:40.660
 virtually our power switch and the board 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:46.120
 So and then we have the wiring harness 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.799
 for the intelligent control we see 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.980
 can it be three hours 3.7? 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.980
 volt 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.830
 in sum, the 12 rechargeable batteries are two pieces 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.730
 are always connected as a package battery 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.730
 from above 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.440
 Here you can see exactly how the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.290
 must be arranged 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.680
 that's actually purely theoretical 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.250
 possible the board would have to be quasi 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.610
 replace the logic board on top of it 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.970
 hangs quasi this split once 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.950
 that yes it temperature sensor ntc in it 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:41.510
 put that there is the control so the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:43.550
 developed control so we will 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.820
 post a second video 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.780
 since we will solder the batteries off we 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.290
 are currently looking for 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.470
 what batteries so again looking for one 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.669
 matching battery or accumulators the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.110
 We can then tune down there 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.169
 at an affordable price and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.990
 Develop a card system like we do 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.180
 the cat can also plant or 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.680
 that like stress, the whole thing is whole 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.770
 time to disassemble 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.310
 we want to have a plug and play system 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.780
 actually looking forward to that 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.780
 see you next video until then
