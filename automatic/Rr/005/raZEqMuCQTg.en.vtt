idea behind tactics Dungeons and Dragons

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.720 
idea behind tactics Dungeons and Dragons
tactics<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:10.200> incorporate<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.310> very

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
tactics is to incorporate a very

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.860 
tactics is to incorporate a very
sophisticated<00:02:11.910> will<00:02:12.510> set

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
sophisticated will set

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.570 
sophisticated will set
that's<00:02:13.080> been<00:02:13.260> balanced<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.830> honed<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.310> years

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that's been balanced and honed for years

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
that's been balanced and honed for years
but<00:02:15.120> make<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:15.540> accessible<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.349> players

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
but make it very accessible for players

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.500 
but make it very accessible for players
to<00:02:16.680> use<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.730> we're<00:02:17.970> streamlining<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to use so we're streamlining the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.479 
to use so we're streamlining the
interface<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.049> much<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.409> possible<00:02:19.560> while<00:02:20.190> also

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
interface as much as possible while also

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.940 
interface as much as possible while also
maintaining<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.540> sophistication<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.739> not

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
maintaining that sophistication it's not

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.589 
maintaining that sophistication it's not
exactly<00:02:23.099> like<00:02:23.549> playing<00:02:23.849> pen<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> paper<00:02:24.239> but

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
exactly like playing pen and paper but

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.360 
exactly like playing pen and paper but
it's<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.260> lot<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.680> playing<00:02:25.980> pen<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.310> paper

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's a lot like playing pen and paper

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.320 
it's a lot like playing pen and paper
when<00:02:26.700> you're<00:02:26.819> sitting<00:02:26.970> around<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.299> table

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
when you're sitting around the table

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.640 
when you're sitting around the table
with<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:27.840> buddies<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.319> you're<00:02:28.440> going
