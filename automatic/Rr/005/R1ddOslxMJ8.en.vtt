00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello let's make a Hawaiian 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.940
 cardboard as you see with a paper tube 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.010
 hygienic that I will cover with this 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.140
 yellow cream colored paper 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.820
 Of course you can also use an orange or 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.880
 a brown cited clear because it will be the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.460
 skin of the Hawaiian doll taking 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.610
 the measurements of the tube with a little 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.080
 glue stick and lining it if not 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.710
 you have this kind of paper also what 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.710
 you can paint 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.680
 Now I'm going to make her skirt her skirt 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.140
 yes you have to do it with paper and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.570
 I'm going to make a little yellow 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.030
 less than half the tube so I've 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.680
 measured and cut out a rectangle that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 I arrived to turn the tube like 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.130
 You see, and as I tell you about a measure 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.200
 that are less than half well now what 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.720
 what I'm going to do is cut some fringes 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.400
 to make the Hawaiian skirt I have 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.770
 this scissors with several blades but what 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.239
 you can do with a normal scissors without 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.680
 to get to the top of everything you see 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.629
 placing the finger as one or two 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.170
 centimeters so I can stick it to the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.299
 tube 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.240
 the short flecks like that in the part of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.979
 the he bent down a little to give it a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 little flight to the skirt and again 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.470
 with glue placed it in the part of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.990
 down the tube 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.930
 see that the closure or termination of the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.790
 paper is left in the two places in the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.830
 back of both the skin of the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.660
 Hawaiian like the little skirt so all the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.420
 paper cuts remain in the part of 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.370
 back and are not seen now for the bikini 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.320
 the top part and make two 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.420
 You can also make two circles 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.680
 starlets two shells the way that 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.720
 you want two hearts 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.580
 I am using yellow paper 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.010
 obviously it can be the color that 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 You want me to cut out a band-aid 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.950
 also black or yellow what 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.420
 you want it to be the bikini strip 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.030
 If you do not have it you can also paint with 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 marker I am options because not always 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.560
 you have all the materials then 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.540
 I'm going to stick it here more or less in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 half of the tube a little bit higher and 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.530
 is going to be the chest part of the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.360
 Hawaiian and on top of these strips I'm going 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.240
 to place 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.310
 the two little circles that are the bikini 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.410
 is very quick to do this craft 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.140
 It's very simple but look how beautiful it is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.820
 to stay now I'm going to do the hair myself 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 I'm going to make black you can 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.840
 do it another color blonde redhead 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.010
 as you want it does not look very good 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.480
 because what I have done is in pencil 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.910
 but now when I cut it you're going to see 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.650
 in the middle I made a fringe and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 I remove the rest of the cardboard so that it 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.180
 I saw his face and cut out a few strands 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.670
 hundreds of hair 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.159
 it stays this way and now with the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.200
 rest so you have long hair 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.120
 I'm going to cut it as you see some strips of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.159
 a centimeter or so they're going to be 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.700
 the strands or long hair by the 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.700
 back side 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.770
 here again the same said with the skirt 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.360
 I'm going to curl it a little bit so it's 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.820
 nicer I'm using the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.890
 marker you can use a straw or 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.420
 a pen or fingers skewered what 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.950
 want but if so screwed 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.710
 around the truth is that the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.540
 way and it looks very good 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.180
 he just screwed it tight and he 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 is the top part I put glue 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.100
 and I put it you have to put the part 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.600
 open on the front of the tube 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 where we have put the bikini that goes to 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.420
 be the little face from the back you see 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 the hair is left 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.440
 now that we have simply the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.220
 drawn and a smart man I'm going to 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.380
 draw little eyes with their eyelashes 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.480
 open or closed as you like 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 a little mouth and some asleep in the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.290
 bikini and I'm going to put some good ones 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.540
 little dots like that around 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.370

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.630
 pink highlighter that I have here I draw you 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.830
 some colors and optional tops and now 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.960
 I 'm going to make a hair ornament 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
 with the yellow paper that I'm going to make 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.680
 a flower you can do as I say a 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.140
 star or a shell can be 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.620
 pretty well a little circle what
