00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.080
 bothered by comments so much that I think I do not know what to answer and apparently

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.600
 well after the info longer than the 100 daily the third 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.020
 what is a newspaper here in chile to the video this video is to say is like a 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.340
 Critical criticism 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.540
 five in the morning to finish this video judge judge judge juan juas juas 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.560
 my 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 and also those who are fans of the ps3 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590
 the same message goes to you I know that this video is more repeated than a 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.240
 tape recorder 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.909
 but who more than die with ante bm gave this idea for this video 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.249
 and as I said give in an idea and presented it in my videos and this idea is 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.299
 of him so that they do not criticize me so much and besides I thought it would be a good idea 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.170
 well before giving my opinion I will ask my friend wikipedia that I 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 explain a little how is this console and what is special 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.109
 thanks cdr gsg 10 gb fcb fgr gb fh 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.640
 good the wii is the fifth desktop video game console produced by nintendo 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 was developed in collaboration with live in it ti the wii is the successor 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.710
 directly from the nintendo that incurs and currently competes against the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.000
 sony playstation 3 and microsoft xbox 360 as part of the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.320
 seventh generation video game consoles nintendo hopes to orient their console like this 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 to a wider audience than its competitors in this generation 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.609
 The most distinctive feature of the console is a wireless controller on 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.400
 wii remote control which can be used as a handheld device with the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.909
 to aim in addition to being able to detect the celebration of movements in three 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.299
 dimensions another of its peculiarities is what has been called wii with these 24 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.349
 that allows you to receive messages and updates through the internet in 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.859
 the standby mode finally the wii can be synchronized with the console 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.290
 portable nintendo ds which allows the wii console to take advantage of the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.819
 touch screen of the nintendo ds since its launch the console received 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.030
 awards for the innovation of his command and the popularity that has generated 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.280
 he has also quickly received awards for the large number of sales 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.720
 that has had on the other hand some developers to notice the success of the 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.979
 ull and worldwide have apologized to the company nintendo for having 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.019
 thrown bowls of low quality and have not been optimistic with the system 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.590
 thanks mister wikipedia 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.290
 from now Mr. wikipedia will help me with my videos looking for 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.620
 information on topics of my videos as expected, returning to the topic 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.140
 as Mr. wikipedia hughes said a console that has gained popularity many 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.390
 sales and awards well now my opinion on the subject I know some will tell me 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.469
 of its power 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.549
 I answer 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.169
 its power is not much 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.359
 but even its gameplay makes up for it some do not like their games 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.519
 that depends on the tastes of each one and good also the wii does not have so 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.099
 good graphics like the xbox and the play 3 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.879
 but their games are very good 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.559
 one that was very popular was the super smash bros brawl that won many sales 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:52.269
 and still sells although I spent it as aa the three days juas juas juas 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.439
 juas juas juas 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.439
 well I'm deviating from the subject 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.749
 also its price is better than that of play 3 of the xbox I do not know but the wii is 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.889
 more durable than the xbox since the xbox you get the three red lights and up 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.109
 there was your console 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.669
 although I must admit that the silver is very good but its price is bad 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.999
 well odo face 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.019
 so their sales are lower 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.459
 the wii has its advantages and its disadvantages 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.129
 example 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.940
 wii have wireless control 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.310
 but its graphics are not so good the xbox is good but it breaks down with 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.229
 ease 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.270
 the fullness is has excellent graphics but its price is too much 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.710
 not now after defending the wii I'm going to criticize her in some ways her 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:34.669
 Wireless control needs batteries at every moment 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.690
 please it's like two days needs a stack 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.410
 goes and batteries at five minutes batteries is like batteries batteries batteries batteries batteries 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.319
 batteries batteries pias batteries that tires me of the wii 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.820
 also that the nunchuk is sold separately 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.010
 since this one is used in several games that is also only for consumption fism 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.800
 or 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.229
 i do not know what else 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.849
 before finishing I want to mention that its family gameplay 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.639
 for having history with the company nintendo and also for its price 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.430
 This console is recommended 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.410
 what the heck, my explanation was more boring than seeing the crescent grass 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.389
 good to make it more poured 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.220
 the informal bad explanation 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.430
 the wii is a stupid console with a stick out snot 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.500
 I say a wired imman control that fears loyal stupid in soria 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.380
 three days of capturing the presence although it is stupid the xbox is there as 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.930
 and two hours playing me or later comes to the last level of your little game 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.830
 stupidity and 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.629
 three lights at that time 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.530
 hit the xbox the break it if you kill yourself 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.740
 for being a damn geek juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.650
 juas juas 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.909
 and the homage is the best I go to the store ask the price 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.250
 two seconds later 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.490
 kill and the seller and you kill yourself for not having the console 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.969
 not for being geek 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.259
 no by estrada geek 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.400
 juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.780
 and the wii is not saved 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.490
 you run out of batteries you break the control 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.330
 you buy the batteries and you buy another control 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.569
 juas juas the wii is recommended 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.940
 because it helps the family to steal the car from your parents. 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.240
 juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas juas 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.229
 I hope no one insults me for this video 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.340
 not before leaving, you want to add something 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.449
 Mr. wikipedia 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.960
 i know if he pays 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.309
 I leave you with the credits
