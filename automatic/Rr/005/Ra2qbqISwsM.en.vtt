five by six dimension and then I will

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.070 
five by six dimension and then I will
fold<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.189> half<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.390> leaves<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.929> nice

I<00:00:42.750> work<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> edge<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I work at the edge so that I don't have

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.670 
I work at the edge so that I don't have
this<00:00:44.640> far<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> slide<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.450> later<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
this far to slide it later on you can do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
this far to slide it later on you can do
it<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> middle<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.340> you'll<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.670> farther

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it in the middle but you'll have farther

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
it in the middle but you'll have farther
to<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.379> done<00:00:50.000> begin

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
wrapping around to make a nice thick

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
wrapping around to make a nice thick
tassel<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.390> wrap<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.289> 50<00:00:56.070> times<00:00:57.079> with<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
tassel I wrap about 50 times with the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
cotton you can do more you can do less

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
cotton you can do more you can do less
it<00:01:01.050> depends<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.440> how<00:01:02.059> thick<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.210> here

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
from the top of the ties and do one knot

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.010 
from the top of the ties and do one knot
to<00:02:27.450> tie<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.930> place<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.510> wrap

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
to tie it in place then you can wrap

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.650 
to tie it in place then you can wrap
this<00:02:31.410> around<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:32.340> couple<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.910> times<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.090> go<00:02:36.540> in

this around a couple of times and go in

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.270 
this around a couple of times and go in
opposite<00:02:37.200> directions<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.890> you'll<00:02:38.130> be

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
opposite directions so that you'll be

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.140 
opposite directions so that you'll be
able<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.549> tie<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.850> later<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:43.700> tie<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.910> loose

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
pieces together give them a nice double

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
pieces together give them a nice double
knot<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.860> they'll<00:02:50.010> stay<00:02:50.040> secure<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:54.269> you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
knot so that they'll stay secure and you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.979 
knot so that they'll stay secure and you
can<00:02:54.930> either<00:02:55.170> leave<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.920> tails<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.989> the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
wrapped around part long enough so that
