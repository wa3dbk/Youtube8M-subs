these broader changes and that's going
to<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.779> couple<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> years<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.769> have

to take a couple of years to have

serious effect if we get a clean energy

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.029 
serious effect if we get a clean energy
standard<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:27.439> gamesa<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> have

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
standard then gamesa is going to have

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
standard then gamesa is going to have
more<00:00:29.519> customers<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
more customers it's not going to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.120 
more customers it's not going to
immediately<00:00:31.710> transform<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> wind<00:00:34.130> industry

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
immediately transform the wind industry

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.020 
immediately transform the wind industry
but<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> much

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
but it's going to make it that much

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.110 
but it's going to make it that much
stronger<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.780> I'll<00:00:36.840> bet<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.820> leaders

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
stronger and I'll bet that the leaders

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
stronger and I'll bet that the leaders
of<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.390> company<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:39.899> start<00:00:40.200> hiring<00:00:40.440> some

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
of your company will start hiring some

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
of your company will start hiring some
more<00:00:40.860> people<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:41.700> be

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
more people because there will be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.660 
more people because there will be
greater<00:00:42.000> demand<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.160> day<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.430> day

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
greater demand and you know day by day

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.770 
greater demand and you know day by day
week<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:45.690> week<00:00:46.140> year<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:46.950> year<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.969> slowly<00:00:48.329> make

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
week by week year by year we slowly make

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.430 
week by week year by year we slowly make
more<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.649> progress<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:51.440> education

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
more and more progress on education

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
more and more progress on education
we're<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> transform<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
we're not going to transform all the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
we're not going to transform all the
schools<00:00:54.059> overnight<00:00:54.480> too<00:00:55.050> many<00:00:55.230> kids<00:00:55.440> are

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
schools overnight too many kids are

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
schools overnight too many kids are
going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.800> dropping<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.280> too<00:00:56.489> many<00:00:56.670> kids

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
going to be dropping out too many kids

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.139 
going to be dropping out too many kids
are<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.590> ranking<00:00:58.590> too<00:00:58.800> low<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
are going to be ranking too low on

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.639 
are going to be ranking too low on
national<00:01:00.149> international<00:01:00.390> standards<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.440> math

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
national international standards on math

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
national international standards on math
and<00:01:01.680> science<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.789> improve<00:01:03.570> those

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and science but if we improve those

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.300 
and science but if we improve those
schools<00:01:04.199> each<00:01:04.860> year<00:01:05.119> then<00:01:06.590> slowly<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.920> surely

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
schools each year then slowly but surely

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.660 
schools each year then slowly but surely
our<00:01:08.580> whole<00:01:09.030> workforce<00:01:09.479> gets<00:01:10.170> better<00:01:10.670> we're

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
our whole workforce gets better we're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
our whole workforce gets better we're
not<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> eliminate<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> debt<00:01:12.979> that's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
not going to eliminate the debt that's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
not going to eliminate the debt that's
built<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.610> night<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.229> each<00:01:16.650> year

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
built up over night but if each year

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
built up over night but if each year
we're<00:01:17.189> making<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.700> choices<00:01:17.759> we're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we're making good choices we're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
we're making good choices we're
investing<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> those<00:01:19.290> things<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.830> need

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
investing in those things that we need

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
investing in those things that we need
not<00:01:20.610> investing<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.600> those<00:01:21.689> things<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
not investing in those things that we

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.710 
not investing in those things that we
don't<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> debt<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.610> come<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:25.100> yeah

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
don't then the debt will come down yeah

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.280 
don't then the debt will come down yeah
that's<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.310> progress<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.970> made<00:01:30.290> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's that's how progress is made you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's that's how progress is made you
know<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.740> our<00:01:31.950> own<00:01:32.070> individual<00:01:32.579> lives<00:01:32.850> you

know in our own individual lives you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
know in our own individual lives you
know<00:01:33.900> whether<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:35.030> trying<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> build<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
know whether it's trying to build a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.980 
know whether it's trying to build a
career<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:37.020> raise<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.590> kids<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.900> get<00:01:39.900> an

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
exercise you know it starts step at a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.440 
exercise you know it starts step at a
time<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.310> slowly<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.030> make<00:01:45.210> progress

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
time and then slowly you make progress

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
time and then slowly you make progress
and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.259> year<00:01:46.829> two<00:01:47.369> years<00:01:47.399> five<00:01:47.700> years

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and then a year two years five years

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
and then a year two years five years
later<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> look<00:01:48.509> back<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.049> said<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
later you look back and you said you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.030 
later you look back and you said you
know<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.570> I'm<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:51.930> place<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
know what I'm in a better place now the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
know what I'm in a better place now the
country<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> same<00:01:53.850> way<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> we've<00:01:57.299> got<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
country is the same way so we've got to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
country is the same way so we've got to
have<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> vision<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.649> we're<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> win
