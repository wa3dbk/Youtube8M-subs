can search all my notebooks as well I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.530 
can search all my notebooks as well I
can<00:00:07.259> search<00:00:07.440> endocrine<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.099> everywhere<00:00:08.670> but

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
can search endocrine for everywhere but

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.860 
can search endocrine for everywhere but
really<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.710> right<00:00:11.130> here<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.330> when<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> go

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
really it's just right here so when I go

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.289 
really it's just right here so when I go
and<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> word<00:00:14.040> endo<00:00:14.460> print<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.969> can

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and I look for the word endo print I can

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.050 
and I look for the word endo print I can
find<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> rather<00:00:15.990> quickly<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.640> go<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
find it rather quickly so when I go on a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080 
find it rather quickly so when I go on a
view<00:00:18.330> list<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.699> that's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
view list and it's right here so that's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.800 
view list and it's right here so that's
where<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.630> find<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.050> word<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.439> no<00:00:22.650> print<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
where I can find the word and no print I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.460 
where I can find the word and no print I
