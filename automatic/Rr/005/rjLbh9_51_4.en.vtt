the<00:00:09.570> time<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.290> test<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.519> five<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> half

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the time on this test is five and a half

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.660 
the time on this test is five and a half
minutes<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> six<00:00:13.290> minutes<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.160> has<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.519> be

somewhere in that range and the point is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.859 
somewhere in that range and the point is

it's<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> performance

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
it's a performance

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:47.340 
it's a performance
his<00:00:30.480> greatest<00:00:30.780> days

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
well done she did an occurred line and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.690 
well done she did an occurred line and
then<00:00:58.440> came<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> next<00:01:00.090> pirouette<00:01:01.700> very

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
then came into the next pirouette very

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.500 
then came into the next pirouette very
high<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.300> scale<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.990> difficulty<00:01:05.510> of

high in the scale for difficulty of
movement<00:01:07.170> calculated<00:01:08.160> risk<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> she<00:01:09.420> was

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
movement calculated risk and she was

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
movement calculated risk and she was
successful<00:01:10.550> so<00:01:11.550> she's<00:01:11.790> gonna<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.210> major

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
successful so she's gonna get major

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.050 
successful so she's gonna get major
