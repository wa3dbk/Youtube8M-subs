my<00:00:32.759> group<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.510> went<00:00:33.690> non-stop

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
my group was that if we went non-stop

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
my group was that if we went non-stop
that<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.590> never<00:00:34.890> stop<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.340> any<00:00:35.460> breaks<00:00:35.760> we

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that we never stop for any breaks we

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.790 
that we never stop for any breaks we
almost<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.390> burned<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.899> each<00:00:37.260> other<00:00:37.440> and
