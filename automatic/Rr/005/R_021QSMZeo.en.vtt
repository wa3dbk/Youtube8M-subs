as<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> leave-in<00:02:41.220> conditioner<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.090> just

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
as a leave-in conditioner I just

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.760 
as a leave-in conditioner I just
shampooed<00:02:43.350> through<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.860> twice<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.620> was

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
shampooed through it twice and that was

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.990 
shampooed through it twice and that was
it<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.160> when<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.340> out<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> shower<00:02:47.820> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it and then when I got out the shower I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.150 
it and then when I got out the shower I
put<00:02:48.210> some<00:02:48.330> cheese<00:02:48.600> silk<00:02:48.840> infusion<00:02:48.960> on<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> now

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.380 
I was kind of skeptical as far as buying
this<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.220> says<00:02:53.430> rinse<00:02:54.210> hair

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
this because it says rinse hair

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.150 
this because it says rinse hair
thoroughly<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.020> then<00:02:55.050> applied<00:02:55.410> 8<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.980> 15

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.780 
thoroughly and then applied 8 to 15
pumps<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:57.380> 15<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.560> 20<00:02:58.920> pumps<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.520> thought

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
pumps or 15 to 20 pumps for thought

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.850
