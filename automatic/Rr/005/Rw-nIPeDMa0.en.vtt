bigger<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.239> always<00:02:14.390> better<00:02:15.519> for<00:02:17.079> an<00:02:18.079> enclosure

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
bigger is always better for an enclosure

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.930 
bigger is always better for an enclosure
a<00:02:20.739> really<00:02:21.739> great<00:02:21.890> thing<00:02:22.040> about<00:02:22.160> Avery's<00:02:22.760> is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
a really great thing about Avery's is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.000 
a really great thing about Avery's is
the<00:02:23.060> birds<00:02:23.299> get<00:02:23.569> natural<00:02:24.349> sunlight<00:02:24.620> which

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
the birds get natural sunlight which

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.460 
the birds get natural sunlight which
vitamin<00:02:25.459> D<00:02:25.579> is<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:25.910> important<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.599> birds<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
vitamin D is so important to birds and a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
vitamin D is so important to birds and a
lot<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.250> behavioral<00:02:28.670> problems<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.299> feather

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
lot of behavioral problems and feather

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.750 
lot of behavioral problems and feather
plucking<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.110> because<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:31.280> doesn't<00:02:31.610> come

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
plucking is because it doesn't come

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.620 
plucking is because it doesn't come
through<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.750> windows<00:02:33.019> properly<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> they're

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
through the windows properly so they're

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.360 
through the windows properly so they're
usually<00:02:35.810> vitamin<00:02:36.410> deficient<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.100> it's<00:02:37.220> really

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
usually vitamin deficient so it's really

00:02:37.370 --> 00:03:44.230 
usually vitamin deficient so it's really
good<00:02:37.639> that<00:02:37.790> they<00:02:37.880> can<00:02:38.030> get<00:02:38.120> outside

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.300 

you
