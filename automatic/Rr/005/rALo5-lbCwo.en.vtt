00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
one in made of you know took a little

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.069 
one in made of you know took a little
bit<00:02:47.909> of<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.120> deflection<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.599> don't<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:48.900> and

this<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.709> actually<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.069> good<00:02:50.250> cross<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:51.000> mean

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420

straight<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.109> head<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.560> unlucky<00:02:53.040> that

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
just over the bar maybe that was a bit
