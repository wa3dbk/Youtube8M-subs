00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
heart let's say by another person they

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
heart let's say by another person they
will<00:01:27.390> reanimate<00:01:28.049> later<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.590> turn<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
turn into a zombie because he establish

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
turn into a zombie because he establish
on<00:02:00.540> me<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> knife<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.680> answer<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
on me with that knife and the answer is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
on me with that knife and the answer is
yes<00:02:02.340> basically<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> plot<00:02:03.540> hole<00:02:03.840> they

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
yes basically that is a plot hole they

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
yes basically that is a plot hole they
wrote<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.850> believe<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
wrote that in and I believe that's the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.609 
wrote that in and I believe that's the
reason<00:02:06.570> why<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.930> didn't<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.259> show

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
reason why they didn't actually show

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
reason why they didn't actually show
Shane<00:02:08.009> stabbing<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> zombies<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.360> they

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
Shane stabbing the zombies because they

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.540 
Shane stabbing the zombies because they
realized<00:02:09.929> afterwards<00:02:10.319> oh<00:02:10.649> shit

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
realized afterwards oh shit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.010 
realized afterwards oh shit
you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:11.970> he<00:02:12.060> stabs<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> zombie<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:12.959> then

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you know if he stabs a zombie and then

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
you know if he stabs a zombie and then
later

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
later

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
later
they<00:02:13.620> cut<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> part<00:02:14.160> out<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.880> you're<00:02:15.060> not<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
they cut that part out so you're not to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.910 
they cut that part out so you're not to
know<00:02:15.510> whether<00:02:15.720> or<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:15.959> Shane<00:02:16.319> was<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> one

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
know whether or not Shane was the one

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.110 
know whether or not Shane was the one
that<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.280> who<00:02:17.430> used<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.760> knife<00:02:17.970> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that you know who used that knife to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.820 
that you know who used that knife to
stab<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.480> zombie<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> plot

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
stab the zombie because it is a plot

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
stab the zombie because it is a plot
hole<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.670> there's<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> plot<00:02:21.090> hole<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> show

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
hole so there's a plot hole in the show

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.340 
hole so there's a plot hole in the show
so<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:24.300> there's<00:02:24.480> no<00:02:24.569> reasonable<00:02:24.959> explanation

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
so and there's no reasonable explanation

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.870 
so and there's no reasonable explanation
to<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.010> unless<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.520> try<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> say

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to that unless you want to try to say

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.730 
to that unless you want to try to say
that<00:02:27.030> well<00:02:27.240> there<00:02:27.750> wasn't<00:02:28.080> enough<00:02:28.319> blood<00:02:28.350> or
