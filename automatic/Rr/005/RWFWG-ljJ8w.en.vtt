00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi i am a princess 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.160
 Today, Marie's friends will tell you very much 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.130
 interesting puzzle for ucoz u87 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.520
 maybe scott with his new teaser 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 made a direct allusion to the present 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.330
 culprit bite and about this to you in detail 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.689
 I'll tell you right now 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.309
 put likes if you want to see more 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.960
 video on this game and let's get started 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 it turns out scott's friends are much smarter 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 than you thought and maybe he left 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 hint of a bite in teaser of the third part 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 fnaf we are now talking about teaser with balun 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 fighting dirt and corruption which appears 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.860
 number 10 and on the teaser written 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 guess who if you think this teaser 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 lasted on the site scott somewhat 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.829
 hours after which the entrance quickly replaced it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 over hand 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.460
 teaser where were fuchsian checks phantoms and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 inscription and it's all in your mind 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 and the most interesting thing in this case is that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 Scott in one day changed two teasers but 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.970
 he usually never does that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 that's what he did try now 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 let's start with teaser 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.329
 in your mind , this phrase itself fits like 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.180
 i like phantom is the hero's imagination 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.310
 and they are not real goals in general to you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.979
 coming to the third part of the game and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.560
 however the teaser from the balun battle is quite 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.070
 suitable you say what's there 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
 depicts a phantom balun battle so this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.299
 teaser 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 relate of 3 and what if I say that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.420
 scott just wanted to confuse you this 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.630
 teaser supposedly refers to fnaf 3 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.719
 but in fact it is not so now 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 explain why and why, however, did for 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.960
 Begin to look carefully at the cap 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 phantom balun battlefield as you can see on the left 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.530
 him everywhere letters all go however balun 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.830
 fight 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 the very game of these letters is not visible from this 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 it follows that a teaser battle is possible 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.050
 this is not the one we see in the game 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 and now friends are the most important fact because 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.160
 whom 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.860
 and my theory appeared on this teaser 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.310
 there is an inscription guess who and at the same time 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.069
 lightening appears a big number 10 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.760
 here comes the biggest question 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.450
 how does this teaser refer to fnaf 3 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.209
 because the number 10 and the question itself on the teaser 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.470
 completely unrelated in the third part 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.500
 games, many began to think that the number 10 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.739
 means 10 pizzerias 10 rooms 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.629
 10 animatronics 10 hours before the game is released 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:03.269
 and the like but all these guesses were 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.239
 meaningless and it was until 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.180
 Scott's new teaser didn't come out 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.120
 Now listen to your friends carefully 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.209
 first teaser with a hint of the fourth 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.900
 part appeared on the Scott site on April 27 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.629
 On May 7, the second teaser came out and just 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.140
 the gap between the output of the rub teaser 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.019
 color was exactly ten days also 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.680
 on teaser with balun fight there is a question 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:34.680
 guess who is guess who made 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.790
 bite and as a cattle tip 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.459
 left number 10 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.939
 and now after the teaser with the nightmarish these 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.150
 exactly ten days later a teaser comes out 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.290
 nightmare and armor and it is on his teaser 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 there is an inscription 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.989
 it was me in the scott page code again 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.829
 added numbers eight and seven 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.540
 making a hint of a bite 87 therefore 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.810
 as overclocking and is the culprit bite 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.569
 87 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.519
 listen carefully further until all 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.970
 thought that the bite was made by mangle 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.450
 or foxy whether anyone else nobody even 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.209
 did not think it could be slaughter and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.530
 I think that you understand that it is now 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.770
 just disassembled baths of sons 2 that 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.050
 the fight itself has no face 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.300
 because it just looks like a nightmarish 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.810
 bath for example give the main 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.960
 similarity of their ears are also similar in theirs 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.570
 both in two rows of volleys and as you can see 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.590
 there is no nightmare pony on the right hand 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.260
 upholstery 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.870
 just like a bathhouse and it looks like 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.419
 so terrible from what is nightmarish 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:52.479
 bonny and real and is dreaming 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.810
 now friends come to the point 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.120
 I think that Scott led his guesses 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.530
 Bonnie is without a face and it is possible that 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.520
 it was he who could perform 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.639
 bite 87 how do you think friends why he 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.030
 no face and my never seen 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.570
 because when he committed and bite him 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.789
 the face was smeared with air to the same 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.880
 his upper face is completely 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.400
 removed so that this does not happen again 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.940
 and maybe due to not hearing 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.370
 bite so it was decided 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.030
 replace all animatronics of this series 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.030
 on but 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.970
 and if the loaf made foxy or mangl 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.300
 or someone else they may also have 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.840
 would remove either through either head however 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.780
 they are all in place except understood 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.440
 which no face and cattle did not show 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.010
 his face 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.060
 never but maybe he will show it 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.190
 precisely the final fourth part of the game 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.380
 a warehouse, but as always you know how to surprise 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.580
 write in the comments what you mean 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.990
