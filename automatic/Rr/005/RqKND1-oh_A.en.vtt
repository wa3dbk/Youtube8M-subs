00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.670
 I do not need to stay here talking and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.610
 speaking as a guitarist became a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.490
 of the most famous playstation 2 games 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 the game was strong and I like it at least 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.690
 I used to play loukas 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.949
 mainly because I never had a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 Playstation 2 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.240
 then when the opportunity for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.240
 playing was crazy 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.620
 only that it was kind of a punishment 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.010
 because everyone talking about tahir 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 hoital how the game was off and I with the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.120
 my humble playstation 1 and it's 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:48.409
 probably it did not just happen 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.949
 With me and it was sad, it was a fuck even though 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:55.280
 ps1 had those games to disguise and 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.620
 Suffering your sorrow like you remember the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.649
 driver that did not have a playstation 2 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.039
 to play getam sandras played the driver 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.430
 and even you could fool and that was 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.430
 Crazy 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.890
 anyway the guitarist or fuck 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 but as I've never had a ps2 the solution 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.500
 was to find games similar to him 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 that's when we get to the little guy 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.530
 playstation 1 version enclosed in quotation marks 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.780
 Just like you see in the title. 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.110
 because the subject of the video is not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.119
 necessarily the guitarist or but 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.119
 guitta frizz you know 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.119
 but it's actually who tried to do the same 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.320
 was the guitarist or even since the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.079
 guitar flash was released in 1998 eight 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 years before the guitarist and at least 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.060
 for me it's a game as much as it is dark 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.090
 unknown and I'm not talking 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.840
 of those bizarre hacked games that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 are there out there 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.099
 the first three rivers are very 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.829
 famous 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.650
 the bands also practically everybody 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.950
 knows a playstation 2 classic 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 ae 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.480
 Wow 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 If you've never played river guitar 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.890
 I'm sure at least you already 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.350
 Heard of the game already on the flix I 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.010
 I doubt you know any song. 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.010
 that plays there 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.950
 doubt even if you have already 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.260
 heard of this game but did not 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.810
 cheat the game has become one of the most 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.840
 influences of the musical genre as well as 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.120
 type river in guitar flix you go 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.390
 touching the notes on the right side of the screen 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.270
 where they go up while you play 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.010
 So you have your combos to win. 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.320
 more points and everything 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.810
 in the center of the screen is passing a 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.590
 animation just to thing not to be so 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.590
 monotonous 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.760
 the scheme is the same as always 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.160
 when the note approaches the bar 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.820
 you press the corresponding button and you 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760
 it was 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.980
 to each note played the game that judges 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.850
 evaluating its accuracy 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.280
 there we have horrible good excellent perfect 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.280
 and when the note is not played miss 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.750
 the control of the fixed guitar in playstation 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.640
 yesterday tried to simulate a guitar 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.310
 really is any control and such 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.870
 until the entrance to the video game is the same 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.920
 traditional controls of the 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.620
 playstation 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.160
 are three notes on the guitar and a species 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.450
 to simulate the vane 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.880
 different from laughing or already 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.770
 placed five notes to play the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.770
 which greatly increased the difficulty 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.330
 the guitar flix can not be played with a 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.030
 normal playstation control 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.580
 only with the guitar even then you would have 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.550
 with this accessory 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.340
 The game is more focused on the genre of rock and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.650
 the traditional genres of japan 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.470
 currently the game is in its tenth 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.260
 ninth version and if it has so much game released 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.440
 that's why the game was successful in 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.440
 Japan 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.220
 Do you realize how the guitarist got 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.440
 several things scream flix an inspiration 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.440
 that resulted in a classic 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.470
 in fact we can say that said hill is 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.470
 an Americanized guitar flix when it was 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.630
 released guitta flix had not yet given 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.120
 the faces here in the americas 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.250
 then its developers created a 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.980
 game similar to the same idea of ​​the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.160
 guitar flix which resulted in guitar 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.160
 River 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.340
