skydiving what am I in for well
basically<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.590> tunnel<00:01:44.920> simulates<00:01:45.459> the<00:01:45.550> same

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
basically the tunnel simulates the same

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.580 
basically the tunnel simulates the same
sensation<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.539> feel<00:01:46.780> when<00:01:46.959> making<00:01:47.110> an<00:01:47.319> actual

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
sensation you feel when making an actual

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
sensation you feel when making an actual
static<00:01:48.009> we<00:01:48.429> actually<00:01:48.729> use<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.000> as<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.330> training

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
static we actually use it as a training

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.900 
static we actually use it as a training
facility<00:01:50.050> training<00:01:50.740> for<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.009> military<00:01:51.490> and

you're gonna be trained to become a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.510 
you're gonna be trained to become a
skydiver<00:02:17.140> only<00:02:17.770> you're<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:17.920> jumping<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:18.459> of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
skydiver only you're not jumping out of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.550 
skydiver only you're not jumping out of
the<00:02:18.610> airplane<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.930> said<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> earlier

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the airplane but you said it earlier

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.170 
the airplane but you said it earlier
it's<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.130> am<00:02:21.280> jumping<00:02:21.849> out<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> airplane

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's like I am jumping out the airplane

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.390 
it's like I am jumping out the airplane
over<00:02:22.390> oh<00:02:22.480> yeah<00:02:22.660> yeah<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.319> really<00:02:23.590> simulates<00:02:24.280> I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
over oh yeah yeah it really simulates I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600 
over oh yeah yeah it really simulates I
mean<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.610> couldn't<00:02:24.819> simulate<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.330> in

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
mean it couldn't simulate it in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850 
mean it couldn't simulate it in
more<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:26.840> fact<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:27.290> use<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> tunnel

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
more it's in in fact we use the tunnel

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.230 
more it's in in fact we use the tunnel
as<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> skydiving<00:02:28.370> training<00:02:28.760> facility<00:02:29.090> to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
as the skydiving training facility to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.140 
as the skydiving training facility to
advance<00:02:29.720> or<00:02:30.110> or<00:02:30.970> accelerate<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.120> learning

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
advance or or accelerate the learning

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.540 
advance or or accelerate the learning
process<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.320> people<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.800> spend<00:02:34.070> time<00:02:34.340> and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
process so people that spend time and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.700 
process so people that spend time and
money<00:02:34.580> going<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.750> tunnel<00:02:35.900> will<00:02:36.320> actually

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
money going in the tunnel will actually

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.770 
money going in the tunnel will actually
you<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.340> accelerate<00:02:38.030> through<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> training

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
you know accelerate through the training

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.740 
you know accelerate through the training
program<00:02:38.810> much<00:02:39.440> faster<00:02:39.950> what<00:02:40.790> age<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.360> people

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
program much faster what age can people

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.300 
program much faster what age can people
come<00:02:41.840> at<00:02:41.960> handy's<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.830> know<00:02:42.920> we've<00:02:43.100> actually

had the youngest was 18 months old the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.680 
had the youngest was 18 months old the
other<00:02:46.010> day<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:46.370> had<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.580> lady<00:02:46.790> come<00:02:47.000> out<00:02:47.210> 90

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
other day we had a lady come out 90

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.780 
other day we had a lady come out 90
years<00:02:47.900> old<00:02:48.140> that's<00:02:48.350> our<00:02:48.530> oldest<00:02:48.950> tunnel<00:02:49.610> fire

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
years old that's our oldest tunnel fire

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.699 
years old that's our oldest tunnel fire
at<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.060> point<00:02:50.300> what<00:02:50.900> happens<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.530> wind

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
at this point what happens if the wind

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.800 
at this point what happens if the wind
just<00:02:51.860> takes<00:02:52.130> me<00:02:52.310> I'm<00:02:52.459> out<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.450> know<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.570> mean

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
just takes me I'm out you know I mean

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.590 
just takes me I'm out you know I mean
okay<00:02:54.680> um<00:02:54.890> basically<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.850> instructor<00:02:56.390> there's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
okay um basically the instructor there's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.820 
okay um basically the instructor there's
an<00:02:56.720> instructor<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.230> tunnel<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.680> then

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
an instructor in the tunnel and then

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.110 
an instructor in the tunnel and then
there's<00:02:57.980> an<00:02:58.130> instructor<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> control

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
there's an instructor in the control

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.390 
there's an instructor in the control
room<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.410> control<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.950> air<00:03:01.070> speed

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
room and so we control the air speed

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.840 
room and so we control the air speed
from<00:03:01.790> zero<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.230> 120<00:03:03.230> miles<00:03:03.560> an<00:03:03.739> hour<00:03:03.860> that's<00:03:04.730> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
from zero to 120 miles an hour that's a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.160 
from zero to 120 miles an hour that's a
part<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> training<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.720> pretty<00:03:05.989> cool

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
part of the training this is pretty cool

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.190 
part of the training this is pretty cool
so<00:03:06.290> my<00:03:06.470> first<00:03:06.709> step<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.220> training<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> what

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
so my first step in training is what

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.479 
so my first step in training is what
first<00:03:09.200> step<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.830> be<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.280> this

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
first step is going to be in this

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.820 
first step is going to be in this
classroom<00:03:10.790> watching<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.870> quick<00:03:12.260> video<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
