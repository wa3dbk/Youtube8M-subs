00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 good kids Ivan forever we are here 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 with you and what happens fellows and good 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.379
 Well , I'm here, I finished the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 game finally and I wanted to show you then 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.070
 the little things and beautiful that the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.280
 better armed also some skills 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.740
 new ones that I have and well then also 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.800
 tell you that in the second channel I will have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.410
 uploaded today or yesterday I do not know the last 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 let's say what the game is for 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 if you want to see it and such without comment 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.789
 I just uploaded it if you want to see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 the end and well then today I come to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.880
 bring what is the best weapon so 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 less when the game is over can 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
 be that after some mission 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 secondary where they give some better weapon or 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.270
 whatever it is but good is the best weapon 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 is this that I have here and well then 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is also this here it is worth original 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 It comes as standard but well this is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.379
 an improvement that we have gotten that has 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.789
 more damage 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.989
 this also has other improvements that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.460
 also because it has more speed and less 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.440
 way more handling and all that but good 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.680
 now you are going to see how cutter 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.660
 teach series 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.330
 it's amazing or it kills in one blow 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.820
 pouch practically any slept is 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.060
 amazing and you do not get tired almost nothing is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.739
 flippant is a piece of weapon that flies 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.660
 and well let's see this one here you go to 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.660
 flipar I love this zombie 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.200
 dt is amazing and good because this is the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.000
 best weapon practically from which 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.050
 there is a time you spend the game is worth as 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.970
 I said then is that there is some mission 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.740
 secondary that gives you a super weapon that 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.080
 is still hidden secret to whatever 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.370
 but good as you see a design here 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.200
 has is called detail weapon can go 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.400
 as good as he is an enemy of the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.580
 that we fight at the end of the game 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.020
 practically and well then you have 268 of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.140
 damage as you are seeing here is worth the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.300
 original has 244 and the modified one that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.460
 we have done 168 and the truth is 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.720
 that kills that flips and is even more 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.430
 it is worth a little less than 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 handling but kills the host 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 zombie 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.490
 I see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 and well then another skill for example 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.880
 that I have practically unlocked 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 end of the game when I passed this is 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.209
 that you will see first up to the head 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.480
 is fixed as you cut that weapon 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.190
 everything here is worth a kind of hook that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.590
 Come, it makes your life easier, but very much 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.940
 in everything that is the game is not a little 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 similar to when you're in mode 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.069
 zombie that I uploaded yesterday or before yesterday 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.530
 before yesterday I created the zombie mode this 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.760
 that you go with the whip is the one that seems 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.900
 spiderman for something similar not the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 truth is that it is quite useful because 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.550
 you get to do like that and you go up in a moment 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.069
 and good for the web restaurant after 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.600
 enough little things that cool 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.090
 much like for example jumping over 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.980
 of the people and then you can catch 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.040
 and once you are clueless you can 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.299
 split the head and much or pose 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.400
 also for example jump over and 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.989
 hit a mega kick and well then a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 lots of things to see if I get the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.650
 high course and then I have a kick 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
 well a very nice double kick that by 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 example if there is a zombie montonera is the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.069
 host and you load a lot and the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.439
 it is true that it is flip 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:08.849
 my god saw now now he is very good 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.079
 in the area where there is so because here 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.439
 look how I 've put all a 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.439
 moment 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.280
 the man 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.170
 that you have more companions 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.670
 they taught me this, yes, I can 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.810
 pretty have jump this over no 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.500
 I will not get to hit him 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.500
 I have done one thing 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.280
 because it teaches how the soul is thrown 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.600
 Now I'm going to show you the trick 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.370
 to duplicate the weapon that did not upload it to 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.050
 second channel you have it more detailed 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.300
 but basically good to see him all 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.680
 the country 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.060
 if it 's there everything in a session does not stop 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.370
 let it do it you have to give it like 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.260
 pause or inventory is worth to duplicate 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.440
 a weapon is as simple as doing this 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.360
 worth there is some area in the family 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.490
 that you see that the hoop but that 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.440
 have a gas pipeline I'm going to 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.760
 save me this here here this so that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.890
 you see how it doubles voucher 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.660
 puts you the easiest you put a gun 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.750
 you only need to have stability 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.729
 which is to be able to throw the weapons is 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.130
 that I'm pointing out here simply 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.600
 you would give him to throw that twice 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.460
 to read what good only explains in the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.590
 own skill throws it and you give the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.150
 pause and you go to your inventory and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.220
 throw away the weapon that you just launched 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.560
 it's worth double then you have one here 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.060
 and another and then you get to be in the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.740
 soil is worth it will throw it back to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.500
 do the same the strip and duplicate another 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.539
 once you take it the strip and duplicate another 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.460
 time like this and good to come here you have 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.470
 been here and here you have a lot more 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.110
 ok you can make as many rejoinders as 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.789
 I want that I do it with weapons with 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.770
 this new weapon and because I have a lot 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.970
 and you keep them in my backpack and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.620
 you're never going to spend you 're always going to 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.500
 having what is the best weapon is worth 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940
 so I advise you to do it and 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.590
 Well then after that you do not have anything 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.080
 just a lot of skill from 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.060
 beautiful things too for example this from 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.540
 here 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.540
 and this 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.240
 and concluded in the head for example if 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.320
 I jump to this and I do the mega kick 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.120
 what happens that 's when there's a 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.800
 zombone montonera is incredible or is it 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 handsome 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.270
 here and here 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.020
 good for you to see that the soul as 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.539
 deal and well then nothing simply 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.550
 tell you that she happens to me from the game that 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.520
 that we are going to do many online games 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.810
 to be with with being the zombie all 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.430
 this because when slow that has 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.099
 liked in the channel and such and just 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.139
 I wanted to teach which is the best weapon by 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.210
 at least for the moment and let's be a little 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.319
 the things that got unlocked like that 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.580
 that nothing chicks because simply 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.930
 I hope you liked that good 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.849
 then also serve the trick this 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.500
 duplicate that you have it in the second 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.289
 channel it uploaded a video yesterday so what 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.379
 I'll leave there too and nothing, there's 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.620
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.620
 video
