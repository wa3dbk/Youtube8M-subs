00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.210
 good youtube I hope you are well today 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.710
 I bring you the second part of how 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.409
 they make many new ones for fifa 13 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.300
 ultimate team in the web application key 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:33.260
 that if we go quickie and I'm already like 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.109
 index I'm already in my fifa account 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 three soles and this time we're going to do the 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:44.030
 method and in it he asked him past what 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.780
 we did with the physical form of silver 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.820
 but this test to see we go in with the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.179
 bronze 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.899
 and finally we end up with the gold looks 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.320
 with the physical forms of gold and we're going 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.659
 quickie to go on and show them how we're doing 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.260
 we search for bronze in search by 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.520
 evolution that are for the physical form 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 so we look here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.189
 the cheapest that is physically 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 for all the team here we put a thousand 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.260
 candles 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:26.010
 we are between this one and one thousand if in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:29.280
 1600 we look for 706 thousand so in 1700 diego 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.180
 well let's go for 15 minutes let's 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 try to buy it in less than 1,700 or 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 less than 1,600 depending if yes what 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.479
 wants to learn fast says fast and the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.750
 physical form has to buy it in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.810
 less than 1,600 so that for 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 put in 1600 because they buy fast 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.960
 but if you want to make profits then 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 they have to wait until the 14th minute 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.250
 there's that you would be 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.860
 selling 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.800
 in 1700 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.710
 I'm not saying that now you go to 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.679
 do this same because remember that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 the prices go down and up that if you 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.210
 they have to verify in the price that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 there are the contracts although here they will see 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.500
 how are we going like the physics the way 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.950
 We will be selling them in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.760
 1700 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.130
 let's find here the maximum price of 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:36.070
 after current low in 1500 we look for 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.070
 give it to 500 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.680
 and try to take it ok I'm going to be 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.680
 here 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.880
 when everything we see 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.410
 1500 because we have more chances of 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.270
 take us and make a profit of 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.810
 two hundred in each we continue 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.390
 here 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.850
 your 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.490
 sometimes remember to be that the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.200
 prices go down and go up so no 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.300
 they are going to do this without having to go 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.420
 look at the price that they are 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.930
 selling purchase and physical fitness ok 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.660
 so that you so that they do not have 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.340
 losses and they simply have 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:35.000
 profit and we continue to buy at 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.270
 see if we do not take them 1500 we have 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.270
 luck 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.250
 and when we're doing this, you have to 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.680
 try to spend all our money that 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.680
 We spend all our video in money 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.439
 when we are all the money then 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.750
 we put the physical form to sell 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:57.049
 because they look like a whole 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.430
 and so start doing the same 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:05.230
 procedure and I 'm going to stop until 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.230
 here because it's true 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.680
 I'm going to play here and now wait for the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.390
 that is until it ends as you see here 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.390
 I won a 2 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.710
 we send them to our 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:30.830
 it's not for the mallet to change pelÃ³n and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.229
 just wait for them to finish and if 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.620
 finished in 1500 if you're lucky and you 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.710
 you wear everything as you see here I had 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.699
 bought some and had put it for 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.770
 that you see them coming and coming back 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.509
 when the physical forms are sold for 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.659
 that you see ok 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.659
 bye 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.220
 good 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.150
 You see, I put everyone in shape 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.270
 physical in 700 that what would be 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.120
 selling I bought them in 1500 and I'm 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.110
 seeing in 1700 how I taught it to 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.190
 previously and nothing I hope you have 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:18.420
 served and remember that the grandfather of that 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.240
 the prices go down and go up and 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:27.420
 I also remind you that 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.430
 there is nothing forgotten this 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.000
 remember that they have to be put in 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.620
 mind that they have to take out the money that 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.540
 we look for the price that is sold and 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.000
 we try to buy the cheap ones for 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:47.330
 get more profits this 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.920
 what else do I tell them I also have to 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.990
 tell them to try when they are 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.960
 doing this method if it's with bronze 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.830
 gold silver that will be explaining more 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.660
 forward the gold 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.520
 they try to fill their deck to 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.590
 change completely 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.210
 with your hand to change try 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.240
 generate the complete 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.280
 so that when they come they get more 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.410
 gains or that since yes until then 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.300
 I hope you can use this video and 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.770
 remember to subscribe to the channel and give me 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.770
 like the video key bye
