that<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.420> talked<00:01:57.689> about<00:01:57.840> before<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.500> our<00:01:58.649> stop

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that we talked about before is our stop

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
that we talked about before is our stop
axle<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.079> tubing<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.590> goes

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
axle here and the tubing that goes

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.999 
axle here and the tubing that goes
around<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> made<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:04.350> piece<00:02:04.649> here

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
around it is made up of this piece here

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.850 
around it is made up of this piece here
which<00:02:05.670> accounts<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> radius<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
which accounts for the radius on the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.490 
which accounts for the radius on the
inside<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.729> can't<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
inside of here we can't have a

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.220 
inside of here we can't have a
ninety<00:02:09.830> degree<00:02:10.130> cut<00:02:10.790> here<00:02:11.150> break<00:02:11.540> off<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.110> we

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
ninety degree cut here break off so we

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
ninety degree cut here break off so we
have<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.580> spacers<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.610> that's<00:02:13.940> part<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.330> our

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
have this spacers so that's part of our

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.700 
have this spacers so that's part of our
outside<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.740> inner<00:02:16.250> piece<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.750> makes<00:02:18.530> up

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
outside the inner piece here makes up

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.640 
outside the inner piece here makes up
part<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:19.010> our<00:02:19.160> outside<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.870> spacer<00:02:21.440> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
part of our outside the spacer that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.780 
part of our outside the spacer that
makes<00:02:22.220> up<00:02:22.400> part<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.760> our<00:02:22.880> outside<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:25.460> shims

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
makes up part of our outside the shims

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.360 
makes up part of our outside the shims
that's<00:02:26.210> part<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> outside<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:28.160> inner

that's part of the outside the inner
part<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.350> bearing<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:30.680> our<00:02:30.890> tagged

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
part of the bearing here our tagged

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.000 
part of the bearing here our tagged
washer<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:33.020> finally<00:02:33.350> we<00:02:33.470> put<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> nut

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
washer and then finally we put the nut

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.420 
washer and then finally we put the nut
on<00:02:34.040> top<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.840> tighten<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.440> guy<00:02:36.620> down<00:02:37.070> really

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
on top and tighten this guy down really

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.000 
on top and tighten this guy down really
really<00:02:37.820> snugly<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> result<00:02:39.770> it's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
really snugly and as a result it's

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.520 
really snugly and as a result it's
always<00:02:40.310> under<00:02:40.460> tension<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.210> this<00:02:41.780> cup<00:02:42.110> axle

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
always under tension and this cup axle

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.680 
always under tension and this cup axle
then<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.800> stronger<00:02:43.400> than<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> would<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.300> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
then is stronger than it would be if it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.900 
then is stronger than it would be if it
didn't<00:02:45.020> have<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.350> spacer<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.070> know<00:02:46.610> when

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
didn't have the spacer I know when

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.250 
didn't have the spacer I know when
you're<00:02:47.030> putting<00:02:47.240> together<00:02:47.390> an<00:02:47.720> American

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
you're putting together an American

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.620 
you're putting together an American
front<00:02:48.590> suspension<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.670> tighten<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.270> until

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
front suspension you tighten it up until

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.840 
front suspension you tighten it up until
the<00:02:50.780> wheel<00:02:50.960> jams<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.680> then<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.890> back<00:02:52.160> back

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
the wheel jams and then you back back

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.060 
the wheel jams and then you back back
the<00:02:53.090> nut<00:02:53.300> off<00:02:53.480> until<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> next<00:02:54.410> split<00:02:54.800> pin

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the nut off until the next split pin

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.980 
the nut off until the next split pin
that's<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> way<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.330> done<00:02:56.390> here<00:02:56.780> this

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's not the way it's done here this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.600 
that's not the way it's done here this
should<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.350> under<00:02:57.560> sixty<00:02:57.920> foot-pounds<00:02:58.520> of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
should be under sixty foot-pounds of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.970 
should be under sixty foot-pounds of
torque<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.240> what<00:02:59.960> keeps<00:03:00.170> these<00:03:00.470> bearings<00:03:00.860> from

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
torque so what keeps these bearings from

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940 
torque so what keeps these bearings from
coming<00:03:01.520> too<00:03:01.700> close<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:03.050> keeping<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.740> hub

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
coming too close in and keeping the hub

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.670 
coming too close in and keeping the hub
from<00:03:04.130> turning<00:03:04.640> those<00:03:05.450> spacers<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.410> showed

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
from turning those spacers that I showed

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.100 
from turning those spacers that I showed
you<00:03:06.710> before<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.910> how<00:03:08.120> many<00:03:08.300> spacers<00:03:08.840> should

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
you before and how many spacers should

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.050 
you before and how many spacers should
should<00:03:09.440> there<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.640> well<00:03:10.640> that's<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.940> good

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
should there be well that's a good

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.710 
should there be well that's a good
question

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
question

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.210 
question
and<00:03:13.270> there's<00:03:14.270> always<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.720> thirty<00:03:15.220> 30

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
and there's always a thirty 30

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.150 
and there's always a thirty 30
thousandths<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:17.800> selectively<00:03:18.800> there's

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
thousandths and then selectively there's

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.760 
thousandths and then selectively there's
a<00:03:19.220> ten<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.670> five<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.209> three<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
a ten to five and a three you have to

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.090 
a ten to five and a three you have to
select<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.280> right<00:03:22.459> number<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.500> washers<00:03:24.500> of

select the right number of washers of
shims<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.940> go<00:03:26.570> on<00:03:26.780> here<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.380> keep<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.190> bearings

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
shims to go on here to keep the bearings

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.570 
shims to go on here to keep the bearings
far<00:03:29.030> enough<00:03:29.209> apart<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.709> they<00:03:30.860> don't<00:03:31.010> bind

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
far enough apart so that they don't bind

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.240 
far enough apart so that they don't bind
up<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.690> when<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:32.989> guy<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.560> together<00:03:33.980> and

this outer outer bearing out here this
is<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> only<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.060> ever<00:04:46.090> goes<00:04:46.479> dry<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
is the only one that ever goes dry the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.680 
is the only one that ever goes dry the
inner<00:04:47.800> bearing<00:04:48.220> always<00:04:48.759> has<00:04:48.970> grease<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.539> it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
inner bearing always has grease on it

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.499 
inner bearing always has grease on it
always<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.250> outer<00:04:51.400> bearing<00:04:51.789> can<00:04:52.030> dry<00:04:52.300> out

always but the outer bearing can dry out

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.059 
always but the outer bearing can dry out
so<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:52.900> put<00:04:53.139> some<00:04:53.289> grease<00:04:53.530> in<00:04:53.560> here<00:04:53.770> you

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
so you put some grease in here you

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.980 
so you put some grease in here you
grease<00:04:54.550> it<00:04:54.729> up<00:04:54.880> put<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.150> back<00:04:55.240> together

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
grease it up put it back together

grease it up put it back together
what<00:04:56.380> I'm<00:04:56.500> telling<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.130> never<00:04:57.310> have

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
what I'm telling you is you never have

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.100 
what I'm telling you is you never have
to<00:04:57.729> take<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.090> hub<00:04:58.270> off<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.630> grease<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.990> inner

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
to take the hub off to grease the inner

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.020 
to take the hub off to grease the inner
wheel<00:04:59.319> bearing<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.220> inner<00:05:00.430> wheel<00:05:00.639> bearing

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
wheel bearing the inner wheel bearing

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.610 
wheel bearing the inner wheel bearing
gets<00:05:01.240> greased<00:05:01.569> from<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.380> grease<00:05:02.590> that

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
gets greased from the grease that

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.219 
gets greased from the grease that
stuff's<00:05:03.099> off<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.610> outer<00:05:03.759> wheel<00:05:04.090> bearing<00:05:04.449> so

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
stuff's off the outer wheel bearing so

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.040 
stuff's off the outer wheel bearing so
even<00:05:05.620> in<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.830> case<00:05:05.860> where<00:05:06.069> this<00:05:06.610> has<00:05:07.240> dried

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
even in the case where this has dried

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.649 
even in the case where this has dried
out<00:05:08.190> turned<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.400> stub<00:05:09.639> axle<00:05:09.849> blue<00:05:10.330> and

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
out turned the stub axle blue and

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.379 
out turned the stub axle blue and
snapped<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.770> off<00:05:11.889> which<00:05:12.430> I've<00:05:12.610> only<00:05:12.789> seen<00:05:13.120> once

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
snapped it off which I've only seen once

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.779 
snapped it off which I've only seen once
the<00:05:14.080> inner<00:05:14.289> bearing<00:05:14.710> still<00:05:15.039> have<00:05:15.280> grease<00:05:15.580> on

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
the inner bearing still have grease on

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:16.980 
the inner bearing still have grease on
it<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.210> don't<00:05:16.270> have<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.750> grease<00:05:16.960> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
it so you don't have to grease that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.879 
it so you don't have to grease that
inner<00:05:17.349> bearing<00:05:17.740> okay<00:05:18.610> again<00:05:19.409> if<00:05:20.409> you<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:20.710> too

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
inner bearing okay again if you get too

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.860 
inner bearing okay again if you get too
much<00:05:21.009> of<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.280> tunc<00:05:21.550> take<00:05:21.940> shims<00:05:22.240> out<00:05:22.479> if<00:05:22.750> you

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
much of a tunc take shims out if you

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.300 
much of a tunc take shims out if you
don't<00:05:23.080> have<00:05:23.289> any<00:05:23.440> chunk<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.009> it's<00:05:24.130> not

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
spinning freely add some shims it's as

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.310 
spinning freely add some shims it's as
easy<00:05:27.430> as<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:27.759> but<00:05:28.479> remember<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.259> is
