00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.780 

I<00:00:04.529> would<00:00:05.529> say<00:00:05.770> the<00:00:06.009> best<00:00:06.130> things<00:00:06.460> about<00:00:06.580> the

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
I would say the best things about the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.330 
I would say the best things about the
program<00:00:06.910> are<00:00:07.479> the<00:00:07.540> women<00:00:08.469> that<00:00:08.830> are<00:00:09.010> in<00:00:09.219> it

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
program are the women that are in it

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.500 
program are the women that are in it
with<00:00:09.490> me

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
with me

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.810 
with me
there's<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.260> great<00:00:11.500> bond<00:00:11.799> within<00:00:12.129> the<00:00:12.340> students

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
there's a great bond within the students

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.090 
there's a great bond within the students
and<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.840> women<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.289> midwives<00:00:14.590> that<00:00:14.770> we<00:00:14.949> work

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
and the women and midwives that we work

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.189 
and the women and midwives that we work
with<00:00:15.279> in<00:00:15.430> the<00:00:15.459> community<00:00:15.670> I<00:00:16.150> guess<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.020> best

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
with in the community I guess the best

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.920 
with in the community I guess the best
thing<00:00:17.320> about<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:18.160> program<00:00:18.279> for<00:00:18.699> me<00:00:18.880> is<00:00:19.150> being

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
thing about the program for me is being

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.320 
thing about the program for me is being
involved<00:00:20.260> with<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:21.759> woman<00:00:22.029> out<00:00:22.150> in<00:00:22.240> the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
involved with the woman out in the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.089 
involved with the woman out in the
community<00:00:22.779> and<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:23.320> would<00:00:23.410> definitely<00:00:23.800> be<00:00:23.919> my

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
community and it would definitely be my

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.370 
community and it would definitely be my
favorite<00:00:24.490> part<00:00:24.640> of<00:00:24.789> it<00:00:24.970> and<00:00:25.419> just<00:00:26.079> all<00:00:26.259> the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
favorite part of it and just all the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.620 
favorite part of it and just all the
amazing<00:00:26.560> people<00:00:26.769> you<00:00:27.099> meet<00:00:27.310> both<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.909> school

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630

absolutely fascinating learning how

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.139 
absolutely fascinating learning how
everything<00:00:47.109> works<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.590> then<00:00:48.129> being<00:00:48.399> actually

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
amazing but you actually come out of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.950 
amazing but you actually come out of
something<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:54.760> especially<00:00:55.510> working<00:00:55.750> with

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
something and especially working with

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.079 
something and especially working with
women<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.859> know<00:00:57.039> after<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.309> birth<00:00:57.550> you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
women and you know after a birth you

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.389 
women and you know after a birth you
come<00:00:58.269> in<00:00:58.390> at<00:00:58.449> I<00:00:58.719> seem<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.829> know<00:01:00.129> what<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.339> was

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
come in at I seem to know what I was

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.490 
come in at I seem to know what I was
doing

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.200 

I<00:01:03.610> think<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.750> challenge<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.210> it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
I think the the challenge is that is it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020 
I think the the challenge is that is it
is<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.420> full-time<00:01:08.870> program<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:09.980> because<00:01:10.220> very

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
is a full-time program but because very

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.280 
is a full-time program but because very
often<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.480> students<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:11.870> doing<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.140> from

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
often the students are doing it from

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.400 
often the students are doing it from
their<00:01:12.680> own<00:01:12.800> home<00:01:13.750> it's<00:01:14.750> probably<00:01:14.840> easy<00:01:15.260> to

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
their own home it's probably easy to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.050 
their own home it's probably easy to
think<00:01:15.710> about<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.520> other<00:01:16.670> things<00:01:16.760> that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
think about all the other things that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.719 
think about all the other things that
they<00:01:17.240> would<00:01:17.390> normally<00:01:17.600> do<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.440> it's<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.370> good

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
they would normally do and it's a good

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.670 
they would normally do and it's a good
idea<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.360> get<00:01:20.479> into<00:01:20.750> some<00:01:20.930> kind<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.229> routine

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
idea to get into some kind of routine

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.010 
idea to get into some kind of routine
where<00:01:22.490> you're<00:01:22.670> either<00:01:22.790> going<00:01:23.090> into<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.540> center

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
where you're either going into a center

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.450 
where you're either going into a center
a<00:01:24.050> room<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.500> your<00:01:24.530> house<00:01:24.800> where<00:01:25.100> you've<00:01:25.250> got

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
a room in your house where you've got

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.040 
a room in your house where you've got
yourself<00:01:25.850> set<00:01:26.030> up<00:01:26.150> as<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> set<00:01:26.570> for<00:01:26.660> your<00:01:26.780> study

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
yourself set up as a set for your study

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.350 
yourself set up as a set for your study
or<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:28.040> going<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.610> library<00:01:28.640> where<00:01:29.270> you're

going somewhere that you it's like
you're<00:01:31.520> going<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.880> work<00:01:32.090> you're<00:01:32.420> actually

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
going to go off and do the program so

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.870 
going to go off and do the program so
you<00:01:34.850> can<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:35.290> crazily<00:01:36.290> busy<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.369> second

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
you can just crazily busy so in second

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.609 
you can just crazily busy so in second
year<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.210> are<00:01:38.240> following<00:01:38.750> women<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.320> doing

especially you know when you're drawing

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.509 
especially you know when you're drawing
a<00:02:22.940> skill<00:02:23.239> for<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> first<00:02:23.750> time<00:02:24.049> or<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.709> you

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
a skill for the first time or where you

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.600 
a skill for the first time or where you
get<00:02:25.670> put<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> spot<00:02:27.100> that's<00:02:28.100> kind<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.519> scary

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
get put on the spot that's kind of scary

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.729 
get put on the spot that's kind of scary
but<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:29.630> me<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> sort<00:02:30.049> of<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.290> bright<00:02:30.500> it's<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
but for me I sort of go bright it's a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.229 
but for me I sort of go bright it's a
challenge<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.370> know<00:02:31.489> another<00:02:31.760> challenge<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
challenge you know another challenge a

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.789 
challenge you know another challenge a
knife<00:02:32.390> take<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.900> guess<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.290> time<00:02:36.560> in

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
knife take it on and I guess the time in

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.380 
knife take it on and I guess the time in
the<00:02:36.920> money<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.549> financially<00:02:38.180> it's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the money like that financially it's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.300 
the money like that financially it's
really<00:02:39.320> really<00:02:39.530> hard<00:02:39.709> because<00:02:39.950> you're

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
really really hard because you're

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.979 
really really hard because you're
putting<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> picture<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.239> your<00:02:41.269> car<00:02:41.570> you're

putting a picture in your car you're

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:42.970 
putting a picture in your car you're
getting<00:02:42.200> people<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> look<00:02:42.560> after<00:02:42.739> your

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
how how humbling it is that women let

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.180 
how how humbling it is that women let
you<00:04:10.170> actually<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.710> part<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.010> their

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
you actually be part of their

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.370 
you actually be part of their
experiences<00:04:11.910> when<00:04:12.210> they<00:04:12.780> don't<00:04:12.900> need<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.230> have

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
experiences when they don't need to have

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.590 
experiences when they don't need to have
a<00:04:13.410> student<00:04:13.800> if<00:04:13.890> they<00:04:13.950> don't<00:04:14.190> want<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.790> so

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
a student if they don't want one and so

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.990 
a student if they don't want one and so
I<00:04:15.960> mean<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.890> think<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.160> highlight<00:04:17.310> probably<00:04:17.880> is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
I mean I think the highlight probably is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.690 
I mean I think the highlight probably is
the<00:04:18.150> personal<00:04:18.570> growth<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.780> comes<00:04:19.110> alongside

the personal growth that comes alongside

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.010 
the personal growth that comes alongside
midwifery<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.210> other<00:04:21.330> students<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:21.989> well
