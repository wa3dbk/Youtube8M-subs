00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 good hello all through and we go with a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.130
 little silly tutorial that I'm going to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.040
 do that is for how to make yourself an icon 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.769
 customized for your game so that's how 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 how good we are going to see it and it is a small 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 detail how cool it looks cool 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.800
 thank you to do it so let's see 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.109
 what for example so now play here I 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 this icon comes out meshal and here below month 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.420
 electric not so we need this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.630
 program called resource hacker 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.550
 which is to be able to open ex excel 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 executable and modify them and in each 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.079
 this page that is and ccoo with 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 vertele.com that will allow us to do the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.129
 icons for first of all I'm going to do 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.879
 the icons from an image that already 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 I had let you choose the sizes what 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.079
 you want me to do you and the depth of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.600
 bits to the amount of colors it has 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.840
 I'm going to do it like that 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 and it makes me unique a favicon I do not want 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 I 'm going to open the sizes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 and this makes me worth 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.440
 so then he has kept it for me 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.580
 downloads 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.850
 downloads 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.130
 then this is an icon worth is a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.870
 icon so I can use it like this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.800
 just ok I'll try it like that 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.920
 then of this program we open the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.530
 excel of the game is the one that runs 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.720
 to play we go to icons and we see that 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 there are several vouchers so this one I'm going to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.450
 give 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.799
 to replace I open the icon that is in 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.980
 downloads so let's see user 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.420
 downloads 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.430
 and here we have the icon I do not know where it's worth 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.380
 here 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.200
 replace vale, we already have it, and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.430
 then I was already you could add 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.620
 more icons worth a week voucher has made me 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.060
 an icon with all three sizes looks like this 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.700
 that we have them like that, then it is 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 you want there to be more sizes icon in 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.770
 this program in this on this web of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 cis that you do in more sizes and if 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.209
 you want for example to be 250 56 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.660
 you can make the image itself will be 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.430
 256 pixels and the program is already 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.310
 will commission to resize 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.780
 different sizes let's see what 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.700
 it could be done in another way 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.640
 making them one by one to as 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.380
 to be able to approach or look so 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 fuzzy is worth because I for example what 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.520
 what I did as this was the theme was 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.519
 of the original size has not gone 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.940
 modifying and here you do not see anything worth it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.319
 I could do one by one so that this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.069
 small was another version more 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.349
 simplified that pixel by pixel for you and 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.750
 that you could read something or see something 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.709
 but we will leave additional already 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.880
 what I do is save and in principle it's worth 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.420
 I have left the original now I open it 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.280
 and see me first and comes out the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 Uncle fuck icon you have to give me 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.209
 failures accept that I want to open up to you 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.140
 I do not want you to analyze anything uncle 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.110
 see now how we modified the ecce 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.910
 because the base gets bastard gets 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.489
 It's worth it since the program opens the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.940
 original then what I'm going to do is going 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.920
 to be deactivate the fucking abbas worth that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.130
 turn it off for 10 minutes you're going to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.250
 take for ass 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.160
 and we open and see that it is updated 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.820
 the icon of our game would be worth 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.580
 doing so the only problem is that 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.380
 look when you modify an ecce 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.010
 automatically the abbot already notes that there 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.440
 something different and you block it and that's it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.280
 ok so this is the way there 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:14.020
 to do I'm going to erase this 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.150
 I'm going to change it, change a name that 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.709
 everything is in its place and then 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.169
 it was worth you have seen how it is done 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.240
 how can we change the icon of our 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.450
 game the only drawback is that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.450
 after detecting that as if it were 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.280
 a virus or something but nothing is worth it and 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.500
 this is what happened for example does 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.220
 time he put a video in which 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.740
 you can download the rpg maker in Spanish 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.020
 there were people who said that he was missing the 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.060
 abbot you have already seen that by any 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.750
 with foolishness that you do the abbot that you 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.120
 jumps 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.310
 I have really opened an ecce 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.370
 modified to change the icon that 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.350
 and you see what problems and has already 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.360
 detected as if it were something rare worth 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.120
 since in principle you have to pay attention 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.490
 of the antivirus but sometimes you jump to the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690
 extras for nonsense and it's already worth 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.220
 so far this video I 'm not 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.200
 rolling arrives so to take it for 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.200
 ass and I hope it's useful bye bye
