00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.227
Hello! In this tutorial we are going to make a wonderful coloring book.

00:00:02.227 --> 00:00:09.227
So, stay with me to follow the steps.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:16.346
Cut a few sheets of white paper in the size of 10.5 cm by 7.5 cm

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:19.566
to make the pages of your coloring book.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:24.236
Choose the motif or motives you like the most. In my case, I'm going to choose

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:26.496
ponies

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:31.266
Once you have chosen your motives, you can begin stamping the pages

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:36.117
These will be the drawings for your coloring book

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:39.126
carefully apply ink on

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.727
the stamp and stamp the first page

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:47.697
Take a different motif for the next page

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:54.697
and for every other page

00:00:56.457 --> 00:01:01.157
Use smaller stamps to create compositions

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:05.627
You will quickly have all the pages

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:06.787
done

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:11.517
When you are through, put them all together piled up in a block

00:01:11.517 --> 00:01:12.407
now

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:15.286
using a blank punched page

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:21.497
as pattern

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:26.247
try to make the perforations in groups, not all the pages at once

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:33.247
to insert the spiral

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:42.036
Once they are all punched

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:46.017
clip them together with a small binder clip but save your pattern

00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:50.697
Put the pages with the drawings aside

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.167
and cut now two 10.5 cm by 7.5 cm rectangles

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:57.977
of pink cardstock

00:01:57.977 --> 00:02:03.397
Now put them together lined up with your pattern, hold them and make

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:06.666
the perforations

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:11.376
Now you have the front and back covers of your book

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:14.757
Next, cut a piece of cardstock

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:17.847
of 2 cm width by 10.5 cm length

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:19.186
Place the pattern

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:26.186
on top to make the holes

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:41.136
Carefully drive the spiral through all the holes

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.456
Decorate the cover with a ribbon or cord

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:53.116
Place it, stick it and cut it

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:55.577
Choose the stamp you like the most

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:58.446
to decorate your cover

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:02.446
Ink it and print it

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:04.917
Now it's time

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.326
to color

00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:09.586
First, we have to choose the colors

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:11.696
As I am going to paint this pony

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.336
I have chosen pink

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:17.076
and dark pink

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:20.736
for the hair tail and mane

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.116
of my little horse

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:25.126
I am going to start

00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:26.416
coloring with this pink

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:29.106
as base color

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:30.536
Later

00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:33.606
I will produce

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.967
shadows intensifying the pink color

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.356
by pressing the pencil stronger

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.196
and using

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:41.816
a darker pink

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:44.126
almost red

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:46.606
to create shadows

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.936
This coloring method is not only easy

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:53.176
but also shows excellent results

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:57.926
To paint the body of the unicorn I have chosen cian blue

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:02.066
First, I'm going to paint the whole body

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.786
with this blue to obtain an even base color

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:09.976
I will intensify later the pencil pressure to obtain

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:12.116
more shadows

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:19.116
and then using a dark blue

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:47.777
Look how pretty is becoming my pony with such easy steps

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:58.546
After coloring the design, cut it out and place it

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:00.647
wherever you like

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:03.046
To give an amazing detail

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:07.546
cut the end of the blue stripe with zick zack scissors

00:05:07.546 --> 00:05:14.546
to match it with the cord

00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:18.277
To finish the work

00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:19.606
stick the band

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:26.606
and the colored design

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:30.497
Now that it is

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.837
ready

00:05:31.837 --> 00:05:35.647
but I would like to put an additional touch

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:41.486
this mini clip that will help to mark the pages

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:43.606
If you want to watch how did I make these mini clips

00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:46.206
to decorate your scrapbooks

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:50.986
click now on top of the clip of your screen

00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:52.107
