 hello from the north of the persistent from here to another post 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.139
 today I'll talk a little bit about windows startup as I leave 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.429
 a little later unhappy action 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.799
 the current goal that using windows lane but this also applies to windows 7 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.210
 or the cespe 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.109
 the procedures are very similar 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.159
 first click here on the start menu button and the chemical search bar 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.579
 place that one can do research you type pms 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.899
 check out 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.609
 configuration msconfig I pressed inter which will open a window that 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.140
 system setup 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.280
 There are some things I can do here but today we go straight to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.550
 program specialization is right. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.060
 what you see here you see as the list of programs that are that 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.290
 initialized along with your windows or 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.040
 and soon he sees himself on the computer he opens it all here looks like there's a lot 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.340
 here on my computer 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.280
 that I see here the basis of the meranti virus the indus defenders some things 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 here I do not even know what they are like 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.040

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.410

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.860
 the order is to sell out there will have a good later here remove start initiating soon 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.550
 that I say my computer 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.820
 your accountant does not need to take care of it to work absolutely nothing 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.620
 I went here and clicked off 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.250
 what is the problem my antivirus for example will not be more interested 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.360
 so I do not want it to happen near the protected time all of the time so I go here 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.610
 reactivated anti-virus captivates the English also argues that it is also a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.730
 was the rest I do not need him to start as soon as the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.180
 ornaments 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.100
 when I go to see 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.930
 1 dvd 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.600
 I'm going to apply the dvd is high and usually I do not need here that the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.500
 can sell would have selected already black tile starts injured me when I want 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.770
 see the dvd I after good plot take off it goes to italy china opened by dvd 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.400
 normally 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.180
 so if it does not hurt any of those programs 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 I like to leave the teams 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.430
 the analysis of the action of windows that others or go get quite a lot then 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.540
 I liked xvi at six months old without having to squeeze anything so I'll leave it 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.009
 marked and skype and here 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.959
 I need then let be healed the base had excluding those of fantasy it 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.249
 I totally took everything else away. 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.939

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.329
 I can quit without restarting next time now that the militia 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.329
 computer I could already notice the differences on my computer 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.879
 reasonably faster it's a worthwhile tip 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.200
 brigade until the next
