one of the most unique things about

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
one of the most unique things about
fishing<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> powerful<00:03:19.530> decision<00:03:20.010> to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
fishing is the powerful decision to

catch and release to catch that fish and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380 
catch and release to catch that fish and
then<00:03:23.190> put<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.430> back<00:03:23.459> where<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.910> came<00:03:23.970> from

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
then put it back where it came from

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.599 
then put it back where it came from
for<00:03:25.290> someone<00:03:25.560> else<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.859> catch<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.280> future

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609

catcher<00:03:29.310> release<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.850> certainly<00:03:30.239> an

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
catcher release is certainly an

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.210 
catcher release is certainly an
