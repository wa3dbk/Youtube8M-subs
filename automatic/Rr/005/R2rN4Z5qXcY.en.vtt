00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
skin this foundation should be okay just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
skin this foundation should be okay just
as<00:01:15.600> long<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.140> set<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.440> with<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> powder<00:01:16.740> his

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
foundation the retails for $50 but I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.250 
foundation the retails for $50 but I
think<00:01:20.190> it<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.700> worth<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.450> especially<00:01:21.630> now

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
think it is very worth it especially now

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.580 
think it is very worth it especially now
that<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.909> turning<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.630> summer<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.409> it's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that it's turning into summer and it's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
that it's turning into summer and it's
getting<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.400> hot<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.240> foundation<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
getting really hot this foundation is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
getting really hot this foundation is
perfect<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.250> said<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> very

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
perfect because like I said it's very

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.510 
perfect because like I said it's very
lightweight<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:31.260> doesn't<00:01:31.680> feel<00:01:31.830> cakey<00:01:32.310> or

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
lightweight and it doesn't feel cakey or

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
lightweight and it doesn't feel cakey or
heavy<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.450> skin<00:01:33.810> also<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> demo<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
heavy on your skin also in the demo you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.999 
heavy on your skin also in the demo you
will<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.369> how<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.150> foundation<00:01:36.900> even<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:37.979> my

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
will see how this foundation even out my

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.690 
will see how this foundation even out my
skin<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.960> lightweight<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.310> medium

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
skin and it's a lightweight to medium

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420 
skin and it's a lightweight to medium
coverage<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.350> very<00:01:43.920> buildable

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
coverage but it is very buildable

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
coverage but it is very buildable
because<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.170> texture<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.650> this

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
because like I said the texture of this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
because like I said the texture of this
foundation<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.729> very<00:01:47.970> very<00:01:48.270> lightweight<00:01:48.570> so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
foundation is very very lightweight so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
foundation is very very lightweight so
it<00:01:49.140> doesn't<00:01:49.470> give<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> cakey<00:01:50.790> look<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it doesn't give you that cakey look on

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
it doesn't give you that cakey look on
your<00:01:51.450> skin<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> also<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.799> how<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.070> blurred<00:01:53.460> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
your skin I also like how it blurred out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.550 
your skin I also like how it blurred out
