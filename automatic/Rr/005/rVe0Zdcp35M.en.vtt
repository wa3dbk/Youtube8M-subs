peculiar distinction because its density

which<00:01:42.390> means<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.049> could<00:01:43.229> find<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
which means that if we could find a

cosmic bathtub big enough it would float

cosmic bathtub big enough it would float
and<00:01:47.990> don't<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
and don't make me say it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.749 
and don't make me say it
it<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:51.149> undoubtedly<00:01:51.750> leave<00:01:52.500> rings<00:01:53.070> around

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it would undoubtedly leave rings around

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.350 
it would undoubtedly leave rings around
the<00:01:54.149> tub<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.439> any<00:01:55.799> rate<00:01:56.159> once<00:01:56.820> you've<00:01:57.060> found

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.840 
will see them until March of 2025 but in
the<00:02:22.630> meantime<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.860> could<00:02:24.070> watch<00:02:24.310> them<00:02:24.640> grow

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
the meantime you could watch them grow

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.460 
the meantime you could watch them grow
until<00:02:25.690> they're<00:02:26.140> at<00:02:26.320> their<00:02:26.530> widest<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.420> 2017

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
until they're at their widest in 2017

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.320 
until they're at their widest in 2017
they're<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:29.710> two<00:02:30.040> degrees<00:02:30.250> open<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.120> now

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
they're about two degrees open right now

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.870 
they're about two degrees open right now
as<00:02:31.510> astronomers<00:02:32.080> say<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:33.130> they<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.520> slowly

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
as astronomers say but they will slowly

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.870 
as astronomers say but they will slowly
keep<00:02:34.270> opening<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.740> much<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.250> by<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.610> end

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
keep opening so much so that by the end

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.810 
keep opening so much so that by the end
of<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.360> year<00:02:37.840> they'll<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.560> 10<00:02:39.070> degrees<00:02:39.310> open

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
of this year they'll be 10 degrees open

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.330 
of this year they'll be 10 degrees open
and<00:02:40.210> this<00:02:40.990> opening<00:02:41.440> process<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:42.160> continue

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and this opening process will continue

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.070 
and this opening process will continue
and<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.510> really<00:02:43.870> fun<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.620> watch<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.880> why<00:02:46.210> do

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and is really fun to watch but why do

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.160 
and is really fun to watch but why do
Saturn's<00:02:47.680> rings<00:02:48.010> open<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.000> close<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:50.260> ask

well<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.590> all<00:02:53.710> has<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.280> with<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.580> positions

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
well it all has to do with the positions

Sun last September it was positioned so
that<00:03:31.120> we<00:03:31.270> saw<00:03:31.510> Saturn's<00:03:32.080> rings<00:03:32.350> edge-on<00:03:33.210> and

Saturn's rings wide open which will

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.970 
Saturn's rings wide open which will
occur<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:41.730> 2017<00:03:42.990> then<00:03:43.990> after<00:03:44.500> seven<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:44.860> a

edge-on again after which they would

edge-on again after which they would

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the next seven and a half years and will

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
the next seven and a half years and will
be<00:03:58.090> wide<00:03:58.450> open<00:03:58.810> once<00:03:59.410> again<00:03:59.620> in<00:04:00.810> 2033

be wide open once again in 2033

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.970 
be wide open once again in 2033
then<00:04:03.250> seven<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.300> half<00:04:04.330> years<00:04:04.870> later<00:04:05.260> we'll

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
then seven and a half years later we'll

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.390 
then seven and a half years later we'll
see<00:04:06.280> them<00:04:06.459> edge-on<00:04:06.940> once<00:04:07.270> again<00:04:07.660> almost

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
see them edge-on once again almost

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.190 
see them edge-on once again almost
exactly<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.640> way<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.150> saw<00:04:10.360> them<00:04:10.630> last

exactly the way we saw them last

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.120 
exactly the way we saw them last
September<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.450> entire<00:04:13.450> cycle<00:04:14.050> takes<00:04:14.950> about

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
September the entire cycle takes about

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.960 
September the entire cycle takes about
29<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.000> half<00:04:16.150> years<00:04:16.600> but<00:04:17.440> remember<00:04:18.370> that

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
29 and a half years but remember that

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.960 
29 and a half years but remember that
Saturn<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.690> not<00:04:20.260> rock

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
Saturn is not rock

back and forth it simply has to do with
