that's<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> whole<00:02:38.010> premise<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.430> Falco's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
that's the whole premise of Falco's

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.449 
that's the whole premise of Falco's
advantage<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.739> kind<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.040> small<00:02:41.250> stage

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
advantage this is kind of a small stage

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.009 
advantage this is kind of a small stage
so<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.730> interesting<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.239> dash<00:02:42.420> dansgame<00:02:42.780> is

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
so it's interesting the dash dansgame is

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.390 
so it's interesting the dash dansgame is
not<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.350> good<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.650> Falcon<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.010> he<00:02:44.100> gets<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
not that good for Falcon and he gets to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880 
not that good for Falcon and he gets to
