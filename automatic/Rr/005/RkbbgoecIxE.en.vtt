talk about but it secret streaks within
cool<00:00:47.039> duty<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.270> black<00:00:48.539> ops<00:00:48.750> 3<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.410> there

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cool duty and like black ops 3 is there

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709

going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.890> seeker<00:00:50.280> streaks<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
going to be seeker streaks and is it the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
going to be seeker streaks and is it the
right<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
right way to go because I think it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
right way to go because I think it's
been<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> big<00:00:53.879> issue<00:00:54.030> since<00:00:54.390> black<00:00:54.629> ops<00:00:54.809> 2<00:00:55.020> we've

up the map where ever it was a this kept

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
up the map where ever it was a this kept
it<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> metal<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.140> new<00:01:19.290> clone<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it as a metal you get new clone and you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
it as a metal you get new clone and you
got<00:01:19.860> unstoppables<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.549> um<00:01:20.759> originally

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
got unstoppables which um originally

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
got unstoppables which um originally
where<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.619> black<00:01:22.979> ops<00:01:23.100> 2<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
where do you actually have black ops 2 I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.770 
where do you actually have black ops 2 I
think<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.729> were<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:23.939> ungrateful<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
think we were a bit ungrateful of it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
think we were a bit ungrateful of it
because<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> gameplay<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.130> black<00:01:26.369> ops<00:01:26.520> 2<00:01:26.640> was

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
because the gameplay in black ops 2 was

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
because the gameplay in black ops 2 was
I<00:01:27.330> personally<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.560> its<00:01:28.920> best<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.490> was

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I personally think at its best it was

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.190 
I personally think at its best it was
always<00:01:29.790> fast<00:01:30.240> pace<00:01:30.570> everyone<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.049> running

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
always fast pace everyone was running

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
always fast pace everyone was running
around<00:01:31.430> if<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:32.610> campus<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.299> could<00:01:33.450> get

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
around if there's campus you could get

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
around if there's campus you could get
that<00:01:33.840> vsat<00:01:34.290> from<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> other<00:01:34.680> opponents<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that vsat from the other opponents on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
that vsat from the other opponents on
their<00:01:35.490> team<00:01:35.759> which<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.270> kind<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> allow<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
their team which would kind of allow you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
their team which would kind of allow you
to<00:01:37.140> counter<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> campus<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.250> sort<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to counter the campus at this sort as a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630 
to counter the campus at this sort as a
perfect<00:01:39.090> mixture<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.070> I've<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.310> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
perfect mixture and I just I've kind of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
perfect mixture and I just I've kind of
hoping<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.180> back<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
hoping to go back to it I don't want a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
hoping to go back to it I don't want a
secret<00:01:43.950> streak<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> game<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
secret streak in this game and it's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.240

weird<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.930> saying<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.159> was

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
weird for me saying that because I was

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that where you know you're going on an

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440 
that where you know you're going on an
absolute<00:01:58.710> end<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.790> build<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.299> in

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
absolute end and you just build it up in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.910 
absolute end and you just build it up in
your<00:02:00.479> combat<00:02:00.990> record<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.619> everything<00:02:01.829> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
your combat record and everything like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
your combat record and everything like
that<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> go

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that thing that will be the way to go

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.039 
that thing that will be the way to go
but<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.450> we'll<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.719> able<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
but we will see that we'll be able to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.360 
but we will see that we'll be able to
see<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.530> e3<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.879> beta<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.950> future

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
see that at e3 or the beta in the future

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
see that at e3 or the beta in the future
but<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.360> will

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
but I do think we will

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.780 
but I do think we will
um<00:02:13.740> find<00:02:14.740> out<00:02:14.920> when<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> game<00:02:15.460> comes<00:02:15.610> out

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
um find out when the game comes out

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.880 
um find out when the game comes out
sadly<00:02:16.060> work<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.600> yeah<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.960> hope<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.380> hope<00:02:17.410> it's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
sadly work but yeah I hope I hope it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
sadly work but yeah I hope I hope it's
not<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> game<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.450> there's<00:02:19.630> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
