monkeys<00:00:00.870> fists<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.829> decorative<00:00:02.580> and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
monkeys fists so decorative and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.680 
monkeys fists so decorative and
functional<00:00:03.560> not<00:00:04.560> basically<00:00:05.279> putting<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.879> big

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
functional not basically putting a big

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.709 
functional not basically putting a big
lump<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.350> end<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> line<00:00:08.630> so<00:00:09.630> we'll

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
lump in the end of the line so we'll

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.240 
lump in the end of the line so we'll
start<00:00:09.960> by<00:00:10.110> taking<00:00:12.049> three<00:00:13.049> full<00:00:13.349> turns<00:00:13.620> around

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
start by taking three full turns around

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.220 
start by taking three full turns around
your<00:00:14.610> hand<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:17.600> 180<00:00:18.600> degrees<00:00:19.020> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
your hand and then go 180 degrees in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.670 
your hand and then go 180 degrees in
other<00:00:19.770> direction<00:00:20.570> for<00:00:21.570> three<00:00:21.840> three<00:00:22.439> more

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
other direction for three three more

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470 
other direction for three three more
full<00:00:22.920> turns<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> save<00:00:23.760> three<00:00:24.029> full<00:00:24.240> turns

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
full turns when I save three full turns

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
full turns when I save three full turns
you'll<00:00:25.470> count<00:00:25.680> three<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.640> side<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you'll count three on the one side and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509 
you'll count three on the one side and
it<00:00:28.140> looks<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.410> I've<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.769> four<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.369> but

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it looks like I've got four here but

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.890 
it looks like I've got four here but
this<00:00:29.640> one's<00:00:29.820> actually<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> disappear

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
this one's actually going to disappear

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200 
this one's actually going to disappear
into<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> line<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.040> you'll<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> moment

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
into the line so you'll see in a moment

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.850 
into the line so you'll see in a moment
that<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:34.050> only<00:00:34.170> three<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
that it's actually only three going to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
that it's actually only three going to
wind<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.219> being<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.700> turns<00:00:36.230> once<00:00:37.230> you've

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
wind up being three turns once you've

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.979 
wind up being three turns once you've
got<00:00:37.530> those<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:38.370> start<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.660> third

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
got those then start going in the third

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.860 
got those then start going in the third
direction<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:40.920> XY<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.059> z<00:00:42.540> direction

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 

okay<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.130> see<00:00:50.250> we've<00:00:50.400> got<00:00:50.430> three<00:00:50.730> fold

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
okay so you can see we've got three fold

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
okay so you can see we've got three fold
and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.810> one<00:00:52.020> disappears<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.830> we'll

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and then this one disappears and we'll

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.070 
and then this one disappears and we'll
go<00:00:59.130> three<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.880> direction<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.390> well<00:01:00.420> first

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
go three in this direction as well first

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.170 
go three in this direction as well first
three<00:01:01.290> isn't<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.190> particularly<00:01:02.730> magical

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
three isn't a particularly magical

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.109 
three isn't a particularly magical
number<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> use<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
number you can use more if you need to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.340 
number you can use more if you need to
I'll<00:01:06.270> show<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> moment<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I'll show you one in a moment that I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.070 
I'll show you one in a moment that I
think<00:01:07.560> has<00:01:07.680> five<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.160> six<00:01:08.190> turns<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
think has five or six turns it just

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
think has five or six turns it just
depends<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> diameter<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> line<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
depends on the diameter of the line that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.100 
depends on the diameter of the line that
you're<00:01:12.119> using<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:14.000> then<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> thickness<00:01:15.690> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
you're using and then the thickness of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:34.790 
you're using and then the thickness of
the<00:01:16.320> object<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:17.010> trying<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> cover

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.290 

okay<00:01:35.580> so<00:01:36.180> basically<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.190> basic<00:01:38.190> form<00:01:38.550> setup

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
okay so basically the basic form setup

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.320 
okay so basically the basic form setup
here<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.920> at<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.160> point<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.970> would<00:01:42.090> if

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
here and at this point you would if

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.610 
here and at this point you would if
you're<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.080> for<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> heaving

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
you're going to use this for a heaving

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.440 
you're going to use this for a heaving
wine<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:44.250> might<00:01:44.400> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> insert<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> heavy

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
wine you might want to insert a heavy

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
wine you might want to insert a heavy
object<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.050> there<00:01:46.200> I've<00:01:46.320> used<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.650> golf<00:01:46.890> ball<00:01:47.160> or

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
object in there I've used a golf ball or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.020 
object in there I've used a golf ball or
a<00:01:47.550> stainless<00:01:48.540> steel<00:01:48.720> bearing<00:01:49.550> put<00:01:50.550> it<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> here

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
a stainless steel bearing put it in here

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
a stainless steel bearing put it in here
and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.690> spend<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.170> working<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and then to spend some time working it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.420 
and then to spend some time working it
nice<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:52.980> tight<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:55.070> sort<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.220> loose

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
nice and tight so it's sort of the loose

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.210 
nice and tight so it's sort of the loose
form<00:01:56.910> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.510> monkey's<00:01:57.870> fist<00:01:58.080> as<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.070> gets

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
form of the monkey's fist as it gets

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.590 
form of the monkey's fist as it gets
tighter<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> I'll<00:01:59.910> show<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.180> tight<00:02:00.450> one

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
tighter and I'll show you a tight one

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.110 
tighter and I'll show you a tight one
here<00:02:00.870> just<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:02.100> practical<00:02:02.430> application<00:02:03.030> as

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
here just for practical application as

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.590 
here just for practical application as
well<00:02:03.270> I'll<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.510> this<00:02:03.690> as<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.900> heaving<00:02:04.320> wine<00:02:05.600> not

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
well I'll use this as a heaving wine not

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
well I'll use this as a heaving wine not
so<00:02:06.900> I've<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> nice<00:02:07.530> monkeys<00:02:07.950> monkeys<00:02:08.369> fist

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so I've got a nice monkeys monkeys fist

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.750 
so I've got a nice monkeys monkeys fist
I<00:02:08.730> think<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.000> got<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> golf<00:02:09.360> ball<00:02:09.750> inside<00:02:10.140> here

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
I think I've got a golf ball inside here

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.700 
I think I've got a golf ball inside here
six<00:02:11.760> turns<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.080> attached<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
six turns and this is attached to a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
six turns and this is attached to a
really<00:02:14.310> light<00:02:14.550> line<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:15.120> easily<00:02:15.540> throw

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
really light line I can easily throw

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
really light line I can easily throw
this<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.560> fifty<00:02:16.860> or<00:02:16.980> sixty<00:02:17.130> foot<00:02:17.520> length

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
this the the fifty or sixty foot length

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.090 
this the the fifty or sixty foot length
of<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.150> line<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.660> tap<00:02:19.140> light<00:02:19.440> line<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
of this line to tap light line then to a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.000 
of this line to tap light line then to a
heavier<00:02:20.520> line<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.570> person<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.050> then<00:02:22.260> on

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
heavier line and the person can then on

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.290 
heavier line and the person can then on
the<00:02:23.160> receiving<00:02:23.460> end<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.880> then<00:02:23.970> pull<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the receiving end and then pull the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
the receiving end and then pull the
heavy<00:02:24.480> line<00:02:24.690> across<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.320> saves<00:02:25.560> me<00:02:25.740> having<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
heavy line across it saves me having to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.730 
heavy line across it saves me having to
try<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> throw<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.550> big<00:02:26.730> heavy<00:02:26.970> line<00:02:27.740> another

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
try to throw a big heavy line another

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.320 
try to throw a big heavy line another
practical<00:02:29.160> application<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> actually<00:02:30.270> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
practical application of this actually I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.200 
practical application of this actually I
use<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.080> buoyant<00:02:31.680> heaving<00:02:32.250> line<00:02:32.400> so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
use in a buoyant heaving line so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.000 
use in a buoyant heaving line so
sometimes<00:02:33.930> will<00:02:34.080> trail<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> line<00:02:34.590> behind<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
sometimes will trail a line behind the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.480 
sometimes will trail a line behind the
boat<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.870> I'll<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> buoyant<00:02:37.980> monkey's

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
boat and I'll have a buoyant monkey's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
boat and I'll have a buoyant monkey's
fist<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.450> end<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> if

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
fist at the end of it so that if

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.070 
fist at the end of it so that if
someone's<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> water<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.600> they<00:02:42.810> manage

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
someone's in the water and they manage

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.449 
someone's in the water and they manage
to<00:02:43.110> catch<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.560> hold<00:02:43.770> at<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> end<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.280> line

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
to catch a hold at the end of the line

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.740 
to catch a hold at the end of the line
or<00:02:44.670> catch<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> hold<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.300> line<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.690> they

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
or catch a hold of the line and they

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.590 
or catch a hold of the line and they
slide<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.140> they've<00:02:47.040> got<00:02:47.220> an<00:02:47.340> end<00:02:47.610> stop<00:02:47.940> they

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
slide down they've got an end stop they

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.900 
slide down they've got an end stop they
won't<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.560> know<00:02:49.650> slide<00:02:49.980> off<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.520> end<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
won't just you know slide off the end of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.199 
won't just you know slide off the end of
of<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:52.100> heaving<00:02:53.100> line<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.520> water<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.090> it's

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
of the heaving line in the water so it's

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.729 
of the heaving line in the water so it's
a<00:02:54.270> bit<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.570> safety<00:02:54.720> feature<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.500> end<00:02:55.620> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
a bit of a safety feature on the end of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.690 
a bit of a safety feature on the end of
you<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:56.100> buoyant<00:02:56.820> heaving<00:02:57.120> line<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:59.100> also

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you a buoyant heaving line and I also

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.370 
you a buoyant heaving line and I also
have<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> pretty<00:03:02.640> old

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
have this is actually a pretty old

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.550 
have this is actually a pretty old
utensil<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.470> I've<00:03:04.590> got<00:03:04.770> here<00:03:06.110> old<00:03:07.110> sailors
