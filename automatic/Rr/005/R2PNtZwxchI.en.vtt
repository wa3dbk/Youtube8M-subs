00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 they are more valuable than men 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 mostly for example the woman always 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 You can do several things at once are 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.370
 in fact it has always been several times 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.500
 man not because I already stumble the other 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.000
 once I bought a caramel half an hour not 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 lasts half for six months the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.820
 shipments he did not take out to eat 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.279
 candies 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 The issue is that the woman is no longer 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.240
 example always has a wash in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 washing machine the bar by artifact not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 rest do not take them out of the box what 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.560
 they plug in they put him clothes never more what 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560
 stop 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.800
 with the washing machine they cook with the 4 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.970
 burners burning at the same time as it does 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.080
 I'll hold you insane when I go to 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.890
 light candles I have all the poor 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.780
 burned here she is not with him with the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
 man could not with men this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.060
 program washing clothes does not get him and you already 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.280
 stay there 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.600
 she they are with the green bar 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.020
 they talk on the phone with hunger and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.180
 they walk jarana weights to the country and you 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.400
 they say what you have to put because 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.750
 you married together those mistakes that 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 you commit and do not dress easier 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.630
 there will be the dino shirt by etea chomba 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.640
 pink 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.119
 I do not have anything I want to clarify this 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.689
 I do not have anything against people who are 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.299
 good person I hate lazio if it fits' 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.700
 tesco la chamba is nothing is a hybrid 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.090
 you do not have the certainty of the shirt 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.060
 has the audacity of the shirt chompa I 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.579
 even the name is a lover takes the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.020
 chamba is a textile metaphor for man 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.020
 married there is nothing 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.080
 has two buttons unbuttoned no no 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080
 has instructions 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.290
 I give you a book a friend tells me no 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.750
 I can change for something else because 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.610
 I have one 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.850
 people do not beat the portfolio of 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.510
 time that they are like this feeling the guy are 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 four letters for so much work 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.490
 the cuff of the neck of the chomba el 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.300
 neck of the grave that is a thing 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.940
 soft sad melancholy that you do not know 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 what is the same as the sex of the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.820
 married man is talking sad 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.820
 melancholic you do not know why 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.780
 and finally the fist of the chomba one of 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.950
 the grave that is misplaced because yes 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.720
 it's called fist 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.720
 it's called a fist where it goes 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.879
 and a lot of asking in the sheet is not here 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.370
 a puffed-up and yes petro achieved 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.830
 half 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.170
 in fact for the belly and in the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.830
 moment when your wife says you to me 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.830
 you do not listen to me 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.580
 girls know what we do not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.710
 heard 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.270
 First exit with a girl if she is 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.180
 going out there you see that the girl moves the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.180
 mouth in a generally annoying noise 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.010
 surely they are articulated words 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.500
 predicate grammatically correct in 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.750
 the best one is not 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.930
 listening to one is speculating the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 I put in the whole thing thank you very much 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.740
 so that the amount that title is the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.130
 book of the track or by psychoanalysis 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:44.190
