1<00:02:13.740> gigahertz<00:02:14.160> dual-core<00:02:14.640> processor<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
1 gigahertz dual-core processor well the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.820 
1 gigahertz dual-core processor well the
ipad<00:02:16.560> 2<00:02:16.860> only<00:02:17.400> had<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.820> 5<00:02:18.570> 1<00:02:19.470> gigahertz

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
ipad 2 only had on a 5 1 gigahertz

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.610 
ipad 2 only had on a 5 1 gigahertz
dual-core<00:02:20.400> processor<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:22.020> what<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.380> managed

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
dual-core processor so what they managed

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.150 
dual-core processor so what they managed
to<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.480> x2<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> end<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> name

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to do that and x2 the end of the name

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
to do that and x2 the end of the name
that's<00:02:26.160> what<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.460> sounds<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.170> although<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
that's what it sounds like although I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.550 
that's what it sounds like although I
admit<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.730> ipad<00:02:30.210> 3<00:02:30.510> does<00:02:30.960> actually<00:02:31.200> have

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
admit the ipad 3 does actually have

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.290 
admit the ipad 3 does actually have
better<00:02:31.800> graphics<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.580> probably<00:02:33.120> has<00:02:33.270> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
better graphics and probably has a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.750 
better graphics and probably has a
slightly<00:02:33.690> faster<00:02:34.080> processing<00:02:34.770> speed<00:02:35.220> but

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
slightly faster processing speed but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.520 
slightly faster processing speed but
still<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.270> essentially<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.110> same<00:02:37.290> problem

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
still is essentially the same problem

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.890 
still is essentially the same problem
and<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.520> apologize<00:02:38.760> pressuring<00:02:39.720> their

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and so I apologize pressuring their

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.540 
and so I apologize pressuring their
customers<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.560> buy<00:02:40.680> more<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> their<00:02:41.310> products

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
customers to buy more of their products

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.690 
customers to buy more of their products
by<00:02:42.300> making<00:02:42.720> more<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> them<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.310> aren't<00:02:44.610> even

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
by making more of them that aren't even

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000 
by making more of them that aren't even
that<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.210> better<00:02:45.660> than<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> original<00:02:46.260> ones

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that much better than the original ones

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.130 
that much better than the original ones
at<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.520> end<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> day<00:02:48.180> you're<00:02:48.630> not<00:02:48.690> paying

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
at the end of the day you're not paying

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.290 
at the end of the day you're not paying
for<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> product<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:50.460> paying<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.000> brand
