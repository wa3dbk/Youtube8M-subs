00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and I'm one that was a pretty simple

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.280

pretty<00:02:34.650> crafty<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> setup<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:37.140> have

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
pretty crafty with the setup we have

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
pretty crafty with the setup we have
these<00:02:37.410> areas<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.860> calling<00:02:38.190> Adventure

weapon<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.670> we've<00:03:06.790> introduced<00:03:07.240> with<00:03:07.360> Far

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
weapon that we've introduced with Far

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.880 
weapon that we've introduced with Far
Cry<00:03:07.660> 4

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
Cry 4

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.160 
Cry 4
it<00:03:09.190> adds<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.790> little<00:03:10.210> more<00:03:10.480> versatility<00:03:10.930> than

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
it adds a little more versatility than

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.100 
it adds a little more versatility than
the<00:03:11.620> bow<00:03:11.800> did<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.220> Far<00:03:12.430> Cry<00:03:12.550> 3<00:03:12.810> obviously<00:03:13.810> it

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the bow did in Far Cry 3 obviously it

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.890 
the bow did in Far Cry 3 obviously it
sacrifices<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.860> long<00:03:15.100> range<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.870> rapid<00:03:16.870> fire

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
sacrifices the long range for rapid fire

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.650 
sacrifices the long range for rapid fire
but<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.770> still<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.980> super<00:03:18.940> useful<00:03:19.150> stealth

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
but it's still a super useful stealth

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660 
but it's still a super useful stealth
weapon<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.280> my<00:03:24.340> favorite
