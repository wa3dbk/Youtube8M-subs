00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.630
 the chromatography consisting of moving a mixture in an average 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.240
 only by means of an intermediate solvent we are only going to use a 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.429
 filter paper 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.289
 in slaves use an inkblot park funeral 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.019
 it is the water that comes out better because it has many components the orifice of the sea 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.029
 a hole is made in the spot 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.460
 with a pen 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.069
 and with holes is passed 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.149
 a filter paper project also that is going to absorb the 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.090
 solvent 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.090
 the solvent put a bucket cobeta can be 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.690
 just a lid 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.790
 from a nescafÃ© pot a cup or something else 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 for painting 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.190
 the solvent is going to be paid 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.800
 I know it's just that we place 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.830
 the stain 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.660
 in such a way what in it a paper credit that inside the stain 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.660
 the overwhelming beating that is moving 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.550
 here we have 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.130
 another example 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 what is a pen pigo ebro stain 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.410
 what happens is that in this case the solvent has to be hawk and you see 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.460
 that is coming out in yellow that I do not know if it shows and a blue color 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.590
 the march of ink 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.160
 which of course takes a while to move to the end the components that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.240
 are these 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 that it can be like this or that way it is simply because we have thrown 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.610
 also aqua team we have salt 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.880
 and with salt moves better and that the more vivid components 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.440
 but you can also do for example 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.630
 the liquid 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.360
 green of a leaf 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.370
 and then we see that the chlorophyll is the final assault 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 in this case the leaf was a leaf 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 d a podium and then that the purple color of the school 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.510
 the green of the chlorophyll and the yellow of the matter rows in the case of the leaves 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.100
 the solvent also alcohol and to do it you do not need 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.890
 do more than catch it a bunch of leaves and pressure the hours 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.860
 on paper once it is seen on paper and a color 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.250
 green is doing exactly the same 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 sancho 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.549
