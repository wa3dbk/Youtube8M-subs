you<00:00:15.059> got<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.540> style<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.920> idea

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
you got in your style but this is idea

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.490 
you got in your style but this is idea
of<00:00:17.520> how<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> use<00:00:18.119> some<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> thingy<00:00:19.050> moves

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
of how to use some of the thingy moves

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.670 
of how to use some of the thingy moves
the<00:00:19.680> basic<00:00:20.130> way<00:00:20.310> they'd<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.550> applied<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the basic way they'd be applied so this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
the basic way they'd be applied so this
one<00:00:22.890> they<00:00:23.010> call<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.279> overcome<00:00:24.000> form<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
one they call the overcome form it's the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.689 
one they call the overcome form it's the
five<00:00:25.710> element<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.730> already<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.519> have

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
five element so already this will have

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
five element so already this will have
to<00:00:29.880> modify<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.449> little<00:00:30.689> when<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
to modify a little when you have

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
to modify a little when you have
somebody<00:00:31.439> different<00:00:32.040> size<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
somebody different size but this is the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
somebody different size but this is the
general<00:00:33.390> gist<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.790> we're<00:00:36.000> doing

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
general gist of it so see we're doing

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.440 
general gist of it so see we're doing
coughing<00:00:36.809> metal<00:00:37.230> okay<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:38.670> I'll<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
coughing metal okay then I'll do to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.590 
coughing metal okay then I'll do to
crushing<00:00:39.809> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> wood<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.829> metal<00:00:41.399> cap<00:00:42.270> wood

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
crushing which is wood so metal cap wood

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.979 
crushing which is wood so metal cap wood
one<00:00:43.469> tooth<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> second<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.510> cut

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
one tooth and the second one you cut

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
one tooth and the second one you cut
this<00:00:46.559> could<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.910> know

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this could be a lot of things you know

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.479 
this could be a lot of things you know
elbow<00:00:48.510> trapper<00:00:48.840> grab<00:00:49.170> before<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> form<00:00:49.890> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
elbow trapper grab before the form you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.029 
elbow trapper grab before the form you
sink<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.360> neutralize<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.739> then

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
sink down to neutralize this and then

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.180 
sink down to neutralize this and then
turn<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.960> he<00:00:55.170> sets<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.890> girl

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
see cuz I attempted a fire so he has to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.910 
see cuz I attempted a fire so he has to
drill<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.609> he<00:00:59.760> switches<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.710> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
drill then he switches and then I have

drill then he switches and then I have
to<00:01:02.070> step<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.750> close

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to step back because this is too close

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
to step back because this is too close
but<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.199> stand<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.589> might<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.670> step

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
but I stand here might get it so I step

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
but I stand here might get it so I step
back<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.510> cross<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.830> exactly<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

you neutralize when you feel like you'd
being<00:01:30.360> pulled<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
being pulled you go with it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:42.520 
being pulled you go with it
so<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> spring<00:01:32.790> back

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.499 

see<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.549> fills<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.090> there's<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
see then this also fills up there's like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.929 
see then this also fills up there's like
a<00:01:45.570> push<00:01:45.899> pankaj<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.500> sticking<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.700> stay

a push pankaj is sticking and you stay

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
a push pankaj is sticking and you stay
close<00:01:48.299> even<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> front<00:01:49.140> rub<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> stop<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
close even the front rub you stop it you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
close even the front rub you stop it you
don't<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.000> too<00:01:51.210> far<00:01:51.509> away<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.710> always

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
don't get too far away and you always

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.310 
don't get too far away and you always
constantly<00:01:53.369> keep<00:01:53.880> spiral<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.140> how<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
constantly keep spiral and see how the

constantly keep spiral and see how the
heart<00:01:55.619> attorney<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> build<00:01:57.929> up

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
heart attorney and then you build up

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.649 
heart attorney and then you build up
your<00:01:58.110> timing<00:01:58.830> like<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.220> so<00:02:00.060> that's<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> move

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
your timing like that so that's the move

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.310 
your timing like that so that's the move
you<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.770> practice<00:02:02.250> fast<00:02:02.549> slow<00:02:03.320> dip

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you do your practice fast slow dip

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
you do your practice fast slow dip
besides<00:02:04.710> sometimes<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.729> gravel

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
besides sometimes they get the gravel
