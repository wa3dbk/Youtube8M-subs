grams<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.260> there<00:01:20.160> are<00:01:20.280> things<00:01:20.490> we

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
grams because there are things we

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.030

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
measuring grams in this country like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.780 
measuring grams in this country like
sugar<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.180> never<00:01:24.510> know<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> gram<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
sugar that we never know what a gram is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.980 
sugar that we never know what a gram is
because<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.119> don't<00:01:27.300> use<00:01:27.450> grams<00:01:27.750> for

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
because they don't use grams for

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.010 
because they don't use grams for
anything<00:01:28.320> else<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.340> nutrition<00:01:29.940> labels<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
anything else but nutrition labels so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.490 
anything else but nutrition labels so
okay<00:01:31.440> now<00:01:31.790> take<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> salt<00:01:33.300> pour<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> salt<00:01:34.259> off

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.310 

you'll<00:01:42.700> find<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.060> corners<00:01:43.479> make<00:01:43.689> it<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.899> easy

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
you'll find the corners make it a easy

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.660 
you'll find the corners make it a easy
easy<00:01:44.920> thing<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.549> you<00:01:45.969> know<00:01:46.000> we<00:01:46.509> pile<00:01:47.259> okay<00:01:47.890> now

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:15.270 

put<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.729> hand

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:25.970 

I<00:02:15.450> gotta<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> tool<00:02:16.900> for<00:02:16.930> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.550 

level<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.099> off<00:02:27.250> yep<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.239> if<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.079> shake<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.349> it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
level it off yep and if you shake it it

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.830 
level it off yep and if you shake it it
levels<00:02:29.920> off<00:02:30.040> yeah<00:02:30.340> now<00:02:30.909> put<00:02:30.969> that<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.629> palm

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
levels off yeah now put that in the palm

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.630 
levels off yeah now put that in the palm
of<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:32.049> left<00:02:32.170> hand<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:35.739> see<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> difference

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
of your left hand you see the difference

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.050 
of your left hand you see the difference
that's<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.569> teaspoon<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:42.189> if<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.489> recipe<00:02:42.700> calls

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
that's a teaspoon so if a recipe calls

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.059 
that's a teaspoon so if a recipe calls
for<00:02:43.150> teaspoon<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.959> salt<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.470> know<00:02:44.709> exactly

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
for teaspoon of salt you know exactly

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.520 
for teaspoon of salt you know exactly
how<00:02:45.340> much<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.970> right<00:02:46.180> measure<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.349> on

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
how much it is now right measure that on

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.280 
how much it is now right measure that on
the<00:02:47.650> scale<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:50.909> should<00:02:51.909> have<00:02:52.030> made<00:02:52.180> sure<00:02:52.290> see

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the scale I should have made sure see

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.379 
the scale I should have made sure see
how<00:02:53.530> many<00:02:53.739> teaspoons<00:02:54.810> make<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> tablespoon<00:03:00.389> so

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
how many teaspoons make a tablespoon so

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.429 
how many teaspoons make a tablespoon so
you're<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.689> measure<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.049> rest<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.379> the

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
you're going to measure the rest of the

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.849 
you're going to measure the rest of the
salt<00:03:02.709> into<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> teaspoons<00:03:03.639> to<00:03:03.879> see<00:03:04.090> how<00:03:04.269> many

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
salt into the teaspoons to see how many

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:20.399 
salt into the teaspoons to see how many
teaspoons<00:03:05.859> make<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> tablespoon

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.229 

so<00:03:21.409> that's<00:03:21.920> how<00:03:22.159> many<00:03:22.400> teaspoons<00:03:22.700> we're<00:03:23.120> going

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
so that's how many teaspoons we're going

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.089 
so that's how many teaspoons we're going
to<00:03:23.299> make<00:03:23.450> them<00:03:23.629> do<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:24.049> home<00:03:24.200> themselves<00:03:24.980> to

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
to make them do it at home themselves to

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.399 
to make them do it at home themselves to
figure<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.489> out<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:26.239> got<00:03:26.390> 20<00:03:26.810> grams<00:03:27.080> again

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
figure it out but we got 20 grams again

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.930 
figure it out but we got 20 grams again
which<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.190> tablespoon<00:03:28.819> weight<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:30.019> salt

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
which is the tablespoon weight of salt

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940 
which is the tablespoon weight of salt
okay
