turn<00:00:33.620> on<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.460> take<00:00:34.610> two<00:00:34.790> things<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.360> you

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
turn on you take two things and you

turn on you take two things and you
smash<00:00:36.050> them<00:00:36.170> together<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:37.130> get<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.340> lot<00:00:37.520> of

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
stuff out of that collision and you try

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.709 
stuff out of that collision and you try
to<00:00:39.430> understand<00:00:40.430> that<00:00:40.730> stuff<00:00:41.000> could<00:00:41.570> be

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
to understand that stuff could be

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.229 
to understand that stuff could be
nothing<00:00:41.930> other<00:00:42.440> than<00:00:42.649> just<00:00:42.710> understanding

everything little did I know and I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.569 
everything little did I know and I
started<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.590> experiments<00:00:49.250> would<00:00:49.399> take

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
started that the experiments would take

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.479 
started that the experiments would take
30<00:00:49.910> years<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.570> Here<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.020> am<00:00:51.140> still<00:00:51.829> not<00:00:52.190> knowing
