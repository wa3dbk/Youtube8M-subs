our<00:00:10.080> computer<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.559> find<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> proper<00:00:11.190> firmware

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
our computer to find the proper firmware

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.549 
our computer to find the proper firmware
I<00:00:11.700> find<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> quickest<00:00:12.780> way<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.019> find<00:00:13.230> the
