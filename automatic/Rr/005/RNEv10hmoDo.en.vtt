00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
entry cone which is the second cone that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.119 
entry cone which is the second cone that
pops<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.140> mirror<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.969> there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
wheel which is one full turn back

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.630 
wheel which is one full turn back
towards<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> mirror<00:01:06.920> with<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.070> car<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.549> in

see that stick in that window right

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.670 
see that stick in that window right
there<00:01:23.570> now<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.080> parallel<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
there now we know we're parallel to that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160 
there now we know we're parallel to that
count<00:01:26.070> okay<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.509> we're<00:01:27.689> done<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
count okay now we're done with this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
count okay now we're done with this
mirror<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
mirror so now what we want to do is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.960 
mirror so now what we want to do is
switch<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.990> other<00:01:31.140> mirror<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> we're

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
switch to the other mirror and we're

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.609 
switch to the other mirror and we're
going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> make<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.540> full<00:01:33.750> turn<00:01:34.020> away<00:01:34.380> from

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
going to make one full turn away from

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
going to make one full turn away from
that<00:01:34.950> mirror<00:01:36.680> look<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.890> mirror<00:01:38.090> back<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that mirror look in that mirror back up

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
that mirror look in that mirror back up
until<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> find<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.229> gap<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.799> size<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
until you find a gap my size with the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.030 
until you find a gap my size with the
exit<00:01:41.759> cone<00:01:42.229> right<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.470> there

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
exit cone right about there

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.780 
exit cone right about there
stop<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> car<00:01:45.530> when<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> find<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> gap<00:01:47.310> now

entry gun sorry about there once you

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.509 
entry gun sorry about there once you
find<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.180> gap<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.540> stop<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.220> want<00:02:54.459> to

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
find that gap you stop now you want to

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.130 
find that gap you stop now you want to
straighten<00:02:54.700> up<00:02:54.970> by<00:02:55.150> making<00:02:55.510> one<00:02:55.690> full<00:02:55.900> turn

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
straighten up by making one full turn

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.210 
straighten up by making one full turn
back<00:02:56.500> towards<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.129> mirror<00:02:57.430> eye<00:02:58.829> back<00:02:59.829> all<00:03:00.040> the

way up until that back bumper is
parallel<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.200> cone<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.160> pivot

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
parallel to that cone that's your pivot

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.650 
parallel to that cone that's your pivot
point<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.079> right<00:03:05.079> about<00:03:05.290> here<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:07.480> you're

done<00:03:07.810> with<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.109> mirror<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.829> switch

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
done with this mirror so now you switch

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.030 
done with this mirror so now you switch
mirrors<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.989> make<00:03:11.139> wonderful<00:03:11.470> turn<00:03:11.829> away

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
mirrors and you make wonderful turn away

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
mirrors and you make wonderful turn away
from<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.519> mirror<00:03:15.389> look<00:03:16.389> in<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.600> mirror<00:03:16.660> back

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
from the mirror look in that mirror back

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.229 
from the mirror look in that mirror back
up<00:03:17.440> until<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.859> find<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.190> gap<00:03:18.400> my<00:03:18.639> size<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.090> the

up until you find a gap my size with the
exit<00:03:19.630> cone<00:03:20.790> right<00:03:21.790> about<00:03:22.090> there<00:03:22.680> stop<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.829> car

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
exit cone right about there stop the car

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.460 
exit cone right about there stop the car
now<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.180> want<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.510> straighten<00:03:25.720> up<00:03:25.989> by<00:03:26.260> making

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
one full turn back towards that mirror

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.659 
one full turn back towards that mirror
now<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.859> back<00:03:30.040> straight<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:32.609> that's<00:03:33.609> all

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
now you just back straight up that's all

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.970 
now you just back straight up that's all
you<00:03:33.790> got<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.030> do<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:35.319> all<00:03:35.410> about<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> gaps

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you got to do it's all about the gaps

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.660 
you got to do it's all about the gaps
gaps<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.060> pivot<00:03:37.329> points
