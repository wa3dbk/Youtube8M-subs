I<00:02:01.899> like<00:02:02.020> about<00:02:02.049> this<00:02:02.439> case<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.950> picture<00:02:03.130> this

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
I like about this case can picture this

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.310 
I like about this case can picture this
is<00:02:03.609> actually<00:02:04.090> probably<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.630> lighter<00:02:04.869> cases

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
is actually probably the lighter cases

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.210 
is actually probably the lighter cases
I've<00:02:05.469> used<00:02:05.859> in<00:02:06.130> charging<00:02:06.999> my<00:02:07.149> s4<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.950> not

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
I've used in charging my s4 it's not

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.040 
I've used in charging my s4 it's not
that<00:02:09.280> heavy<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:10.119> does<00:02:10.420> increase<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.869> way<00:02:10.989> this

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that heavy it does increase the way this

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.110 
that heavy it does increase the way this
was<00:02:11.409> very<00:02:11.739> light<00:02:12.099> device<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.819> does

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
was very light device but it does

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.530 
was very light device but it does
increase<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.870> weight<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
increase the weight of you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.929 
increase the weight of you
for<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.200> that's<00:02:15.799> something<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.129> note<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.819> it

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
for so that's something to note now it

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.789 
for so that's something to note now it
doesn't<00:02:17.209> cover<00:02:17.420> around<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.959> s4<00:02:18.379> total<00:02:18.709> you

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
doesn't cover around the s4 total you

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.099 
doesn't cover around the s4 total you
can<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.189> the<00:02:19.310> edges<00:02:19.640> are<00:02:19.730> open<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.659> literally

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
can see the edges are open so literally

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.280 
can see the edges are open so literally
does<00:02:21.409> clamps<00:02:21.799> on<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.980> two<00:02:22.219> top<00:02:22.459> corners<00:02:22.819> and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
does clamps on the two top corners and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.839 
does clamps on the two top corners and
fits<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.500> bottom<00:02:25.189> and<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:25.579> pretty

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
fits in the bottom and that's pretty

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.429 
fits in the bottom and that's pretty
much<00:02:25.969> it<00:02:26.090> they<00:02:26.629> don't<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.109> to<00:02:27.200> interfere

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
much it they don't want to interfere

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.339 
much it they don't want to interfere
with<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.980> casing<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> s4<00:02:29.359> so<00:02:30.109> your<00:02:30.230> ass

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
with the casing of the s4 so your ass

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.819 
with the casing of the s4 so your ass
for<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.920> solid<00:02:31.790> all<00:02:31.970> around<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:33.019> in<00:02:33.500> terms<00:02:33.560> of

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
for is solid all around now in terms of

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.149 
for is solid all around now in terms of
charging<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.609> had<00:02:34.909> a<00:02:35.530> fifty<00:02:36.530> percent<00:02:36.859> battery

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
charging I had a fifty percent battery

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.539 
charging I had a fifty percent battery
life<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> took<00:02:38.239> about<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:39.530> hour's<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.489> to

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
life and it took about an hour's so to

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.759 
life and it took about an hour's so to
get<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.909> filled<00:02:41.510> up<00:02:41.659> so<00:02:41.840> basically<00:02:42.290> about<00:02:42.560> two

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
get it filled up so basically about two

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.520 
get it filled up so basically about two
hours<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.129> fully<00:02:43.280> charge<00:02:43.629> us<00:02:44.629> for<00:02:44.659> which<00:02:45.170> isn't

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
hours to fully charge us for which isn't

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.979 
hours to fully charge us for which isn't
bad<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:46.069> actually<00:02:46.430> pretty<00:02:46.819> good<00:02:47.060> now<00:02:47.359> you<00:02:47.900> can

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
bad I actually pretty good now you can

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.020 
bad I actually pretty good now you can
see<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.319> red<00:02:48.470> indicator<00:02:48.980> there<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.639> show<00:02:49.970> you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
see the red indicator there and show you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.280 
see the red indicator there and show you
my<00:02:50.120> battery<00:02:50.569> life<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.019> see<00:02:51.139> it's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
my battery life you can see it's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.890 
my battery life you can see it's
charging<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.180> actually<00:02:53.329> charging

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
charging there so it's actually charging

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800 
charging there so it's actually charging
my<00:02:54.109> galaxy<00:02:54.590> s4<00:02:55.099> for<00:02:55.430> me<00:02:55.579> cuz<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.239> had<00:02:56.359> tapped<00:02:56.599> it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
my galaxy s4 for me cuz I had tapped it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.710 
my galaxy s4 for me cuz I had tapped it
and<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.079> can<00:02:57.230> see<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.859> does<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.700> very<00:02:59.419> simple

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
and you can see it does that very simple

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.679 
and you can see it does that very simple
now<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.069> test<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.430> case<00:03:01.669> out<00:03:01.909> in<00:03:02.239> general

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
now just to test the case out in general

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.619 
now just to test the case out in general
with<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.700> speaker<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.879> we<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.180> here<00:03:05.419> and

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
with the speaker that we have here and

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.979 
with the speaker that we have here and
see<00:03:05.930> what<00:03:06.079> we<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.349> here<00:03:06.909> where's<00:03:07.909> YouTube<00:03:08.750> Oh

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
see what we have here where's YouTube Oh

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
see what we have here where's YouTube Oh
actually<00:03:11.989> we<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.349> just<00:03:12.470> play<00:03:12.620> audio<00:03:13.510> play

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
actually we can just play audio play

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.360 
actually we can just play audio play
with<00:03:14.720> audio<00:03:15.049> here<00:03:15.260> for<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.799> give<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.250> an

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
with audio here for you give you an

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:30.089 
with audio here for you give you an
example<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.030> can<00:03:29.150> hear<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.479> quite<00:03:29.690> well

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
example so you can hear that quite well

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.580 
example so you can hear that quite well
and<00:03:31.510> that's<00:03:32.510> what<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> speakers<00:03:33.199> at<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.409> back

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and that's what the speakers at the back

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.369 
and that's what the speakers at the back
so<00:03:33.889> it<00:03:34.489> works<00:03:34.760> out<00:03:34.909> very<00:03:34.970> well<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.629> it's<00:03:36.139> still

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
so it works out very well and it's still

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.430 
so it works out very well and it's still
very<00:03:36.979> very<00:03:37.129> solid<00:03:37.729> overall<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.419> like<00:03:39.019> this<00:03:39.169> case

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
very very solid overall I like this case

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.319 
very very solid overall I like this case
it's<00:03:39.769> nice<00:03:40.010> it's<00:03:40.430> simple<00:03:40.849> is<00:03:40.909> portable<00:03:41.269> you

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
it's nice it's simple is portable you

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.469 
it's nice it's simple is portable you
can<00:03:41.510> get<00:03:41.720> at<00:03:41.900> nasty<00:03:42.409> calm<00:03:43.090> we'll<00:03:44.090> have<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.239> link

for<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.900> in<00:03:45.019> this<00:03:45.169> video<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.799> think<00:03:46.040> also

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
for you in this video and I think also

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.879 
for you in this video and I think also
they<00:03:46.699> do<00:03:46.970> sell<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.419> amazon<00:03:47.959> but<00:03:48.500> it's<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.709> cool

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
they do sell on amazon but it's a cool

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.759 
they do sell on amazon but it's a cool
case<00:03:49.099> very<00:03:49.639> simple<00:03:50.090> very<00:03:50.359> easy<00:03:50.720> use<00:03:51.319> comes<00:03:51.590> in

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
case very simple very easy use comes in

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.979 
case very simple very easy use comes in
black<00:03:51.919> or<00:03:51.979> white<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.239> scott<00:03:53.479> grips<00:03:53.810> on

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
black or white if you see scott grips on

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.689 
black or white if you see scott grips on
the<00:03:54.109> side<00:03:54.349> so<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.680> easy<00:03:54.919> it's<00:03:55.159> a<00:03:55.220> whole<00:03:55.400> us

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
the side so it's easy it's a whole us

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.960 
the side so it's easy it's a whole us
for<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.419> it's<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:56.810> smooth<00:03:57.199> as<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.349> center

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
for and it's not as smooth as the center

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.640 
for and it's not as smooth as the center
but<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> nice<00:03:59.150> case<00:03:59.449> again<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.229> doesn't

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
but a nice case again it doesn't

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.409 
but a nice case again it doesn't
interfere<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:01.220> your<00:04:01.310> galaxy<00:04:01.699> s4<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.209> does
