the one m9 has twenty and one thing I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
the one m9 has twenty and one thing I
noticed<00:00:30.119> between<00:00:30.449> these<00:00:30.599> photos<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
noticed between these photos is that the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.479 
noticed between these photos is that the
iPhone<00:00:32.279> 6<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> galaxy<00:00:33.660> s6<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.590> nice<00:00:34.980> high

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
iPhone 6 and the galaxy s6 has nice high

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.580 
iPhone 6 and the galaxy s6 has nice high
dynamic<00:00:35.969> range<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> blue

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
dynamic range so you can see the blue

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
dynamic range so you can see the blue
sky<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> HTC<00:00:39.120> One<00:00:39.480> m9<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> see

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
sky but on the HTC One m9 you can see

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
sky but on the HTC One m9 you can see
the<00:00:40.890> sky<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.340> blown<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.450> dynamic

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the sky is blown out so the dynamic

00:00:42.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the sky is blown out so the dynamic
range<00:00:43.079> isn't<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> other<00:00:44.489> two

camera and then we'll take a look at the
low-light<00:04:04.519> performances<00:04:05.209> all<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.049> this

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
low-light performances all right so this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.589 
low-light performances all right so this
is<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.439> front-facing<00:04:06.980> video<00:04:07.459> test<00:04:07.849> using<00:04:08.329> these

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.300 
6 and T Samsung Galaxy s6 the HTC One m9
has<00:04:17.449> a<00:04:17.479> lot<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.720> contrast<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:19.039> iPhone<00:04:19.280> 6

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
has a lot of contrast and the iPhone 6

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.089 
has a lot of contrast and the iPhone 6
had<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> nice<00:04:20.479> balanced<00:04:20.989> exposure<00:04:21.380> if<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.859> had<00:04:21.979> to

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
had a nice balanced exposure if I had to

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.529 
had a nice balanced exposure if I had to
choose<00:04:22.280> between<00:04:22.340> these<00:04:22.789> three<00:04:23.030> front-facing

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
choose between these three front-facing

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.330 
choose between these three front-facing
cameras<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.169> would<00:04:24.440> choose<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.889> Samsung

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
cameras I would choose the Samsung

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.760 
cameras I would choose the Samsung
Galaxy<00:04:25.490> s6<00:04:26.120> because<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.110> does<00:04:27.259> have<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> wider

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
Galaxy s6 because it does have a wider

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.439 
Galaxy s6 because it does have a wider
angle<00:04:28.160> lens<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.060> great<00:04:29.180> for<00:04:29.360> doing

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
angle lens so it's great for doing

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.450 
angle lens so it's great for doing
selfies<00:04:30.050> or<00:04:30.380> filming<00:04:30.770> yourself<00:04:30.830> talking<00:04:31.310> to

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
selfies or filming yourself talking to

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.189 
selfies or filming yourself talking to
the<00:04:31.610> camera<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.750> let<00:04:32.930> me<00:04:32.990> know<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.169> the

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
alright now let's take a look at the

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.920 
alright now let's take a look at the
low-light<00:04:37.250> performance<00:04:37.280> now<00:04:38.270> taking<00:04:38.630> photos

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
low-light performance now taking photos

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.589 
low-light performance now taking photos
at<00:04:39.110> low-light<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.800> noticed<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.580> m9<00:04:41.060> it's

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
at low-light I noticed that the m9 it's

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.960 
at low-light I noticed that the m9 it's
just<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.080> bit<00:04:42.229> slow<00:04:42.590> at<00:04:42.770> focusing<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.849> my

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
just a bit slow at focusing and my

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.400 
just a bit slow at focusing and my
favorite<00:04:44.330> camera<00:04:44.509> for<00:04:44.810> low-light<00:04:45.139> is

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
favorite camera for low-light is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.189 
favorite camera for low-light is
definitely<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.220> galaxy<00:04:46.699> s6<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.840> has<00:04:48.020> the

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
definitely the galaxy s6 it has the

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.409 
definitely the galaxy s6 it has the
least<00:04:48.349> amount<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.800> noise<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.909> photos<00:04:50.210> are

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
least amount of noise and the photos are

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.029 
least amount of noise and the photos are
still<00:04:50.720> really<00:04:51.020> sharp<00:04:51.260> even<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.830> low-light

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
still really sharp even in low-light

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.010 
still really sharp even in low-light
conditions<00:04:52.789> now<00:04:53.360> here<00:04:53.539> are<00:04:53.630> some<00:04:53.690> photos

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
conditions now here are some photos

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:03.450 
conditions now here are some photos
taken<00:04:54.530> with<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.949> LED<00:04:55.340> flash

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.860 

now<00:05:04.460> let's<00:05:04.640> move<00:05:04.760> on<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.090> some<00:05:05.420> lowlights

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
now let's move on to some lowlights

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:52.400 
now let's move on to some lowlights
videos

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.450 

all<00:05:53.410> right<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:53.680> here's<00:05:53.920> a<00:05:53.980> front-facing

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
all right so here's a front-facing

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.610 
all right so here's a front-facing
low-light<00:05:55.090> video<00:05:55.390> test<00:05:55.690> using<00:05:56.110> these<00:05:56.260> three

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
low-light video test using these three

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.090 
low-light video test using these three
smartphones<00:05:57.070> as<00:05:57.360> usual<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.480> HTC<00:05:59.080> one<00:05:59.350> has<00:05:59.710> a

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
smartphones as usual the HTC one has a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.070 
smartphones as usual the HTC one has a
really<00:06:00.580> high<00:06:00.820> exposure<00:06:01.210> so<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.600> can<00:06:01.780> see<00:06:01.960> the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
really high exposure so you can see the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.980 
really high exposure so you can see the
background<00:06:02.260> is<00:06:02.620> all<00:06:02.860> white<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:03.480> iPhone<00:06:04.480> 6<00:06:04.780> is

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
background is all white the iPhone 6 is

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.600 
background is all white the iPhone 6 is
just<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.350> bit<00:06:05.500> darker<00:06:05.680> compared<00:06:06.280> to<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.490> other

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
just a bit darker compared to the other

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.680 
just a bit darker compared to the other
two<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.930> s6<00:06:08.500> has<00:06:08.950> a<00:06:08.980> wider<00:06:09.520> angle<00:06:09.940> lens<00:06:09.970> in

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
two and the s6 has a wider angle lens in

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.110 
two and the s6 has a wider angle lens in
terms<00:06:11.470> of<00:06:11.650> noise<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:12.130> can't<00:06:12.370> really<00:06:12.550> tell<00:06:12.880> just

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
terms of noise I can't really tell just

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.570 
terms of noise I can't really tell just
by<00:06:13.570> looking<00:06:13.960> at<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.170> screens<00:06:14.470> here<00:06:14.680> so<00:06:15.010> you

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
by looking at the screens here so you

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.280 
by looking at the screens here so you
decide<00:06:15.940> which<00:06:16.150> front-facing<00:06:16.780> camera<00:06:17.170> you

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
decide which front-facing camera you

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.890 
decide which front-facing camera you
prefer<00:06:17.640> so<00:06:18.640> this<00:06:18.820> pretty<00:06:19.030> much<00:06:19.120> concludes<00:06:19.420> my

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
prefer so this pretty much concludes my

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.660 
prefer so this pretty much concludes my
camera<00:06:20.320> comparison<00:06:20.800> between<00:06:20.950> these<00:06:21.250> three

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
camera comparison between these three

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.400 
camera comparison between these three
