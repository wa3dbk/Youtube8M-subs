mascara wand if you come in real close
on<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:11.010> fibers

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
on it you can see all little fibers

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
on it you can see all little fibers
attached<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> looks<00:01:14.100> like

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
attached to it that's what it looks like

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
attached to it that's what it looks like
up<00:01:14.670> close<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.450> possible

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
up close and possible

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
up close and possible
the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.729> gonna<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.570> very

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the way that I'm gonna do this is very

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
the way that I'm gonna do this is very
similar<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.640> other

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
similar to how I would do it with other

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 
similar to how I would do it with other
fiber<00:01:21.270> mascara<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> curl

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fiber mascara so first I'm going to curl

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.780 
fiber mascara so first I'm going to curl
my<00:01:23.700> lashes<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:28.009> then<00:01:29.009> I'm<00:01:29.100> gonna<00:01:29.189> apply<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
my lashes and then I'm gonna apply a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.149 
my lashes and then I'm gonna apply a
waterproof<00:01:30.720> mascara<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
waterproof mascara and what this is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.819 
waterproof mascara and what this is
going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.790> hold<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.630> curl<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
going to do is hold the curl so that the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to do is hold the curl so that the
curl<00:01:35.159> doesn't<00:01:35.610> move<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> use<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
curl doesn't move when you use a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
curl doesn't move when you use a
waterproof<00:01:37.799> mascara

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
waterproof mascara

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
waterproof mascara
the<00:01:39.360> waterproof<00:01:39.840> formula<00:01:40.320> has<00:01:40.530> wax<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the waterproof formula has wax in the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.700 
the waterproof formula has wax in the
formula<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.159> keeps<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.909> curl

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
formula and that is what keeps your curl

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
formula and that is what keeps your curl
longer<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.159> you've<00:01:47.340> tried<00:01:47.670> traditional

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
longer so if you've tried traditional

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.289 
longer so if you've tried traditional
mascaras<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.250> waterproof<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mascaras that are not waterproof and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
mascaras that are not waterproof and
you've<00:01:51.509> noticed<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> curl<00:01:52.530> falls<00:01:52.979> flat

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you've noticed that the curl falls flat

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.429 
you've noticed that the curl falls flat
throughout<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> day<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.590> why<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.670> try<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
throughout the day that is why so try a

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.990 
throughout the day that is why so try a
waterproof<00:01:58.439> mascara<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.130> does<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> world

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
waterproof mascara it does make a world

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:26.500 
waterproof mascara it does make a world
of<00:02:00.329> difference

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
but it weighs the lashes down because it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.900 
but it weighs the lashes down because it
is<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.630> heavy<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:25.070> even<00:04:25.400> though<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.580> wear

a<00:04:25.940> waterproof<00:04:26.330> mascara<00:04:26.870> underneath<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.860> you

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
a waterproof mascara underneath and you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.950 
a waterproof mascara underneath and you
curl<00:04:28.160> your<00:04:28.340> lashes<00:04:28.430> beforehand<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
curl your lashes beforehand because the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.990 
curl your lashes beforehand because the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
formula is so heavy it ends up

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.090 
formula is so heavy it ends up
dispersing<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.990> curl<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.800> they<00:04:33.920> kind

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
dispersing that curl so that they kind

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.340 
dispersing that curl so that they kind
of<00:04:34.220> flatten<00:04:34.790> out<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.390> then<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:35.900> lose<00:04:36.140> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350
