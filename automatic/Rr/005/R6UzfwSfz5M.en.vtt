00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
I've ghosts hardened and I think

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.690 
I've ghosts hardened and I think
tactical<00:02:45.810> mask<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.709> run<00:02:47.069> over<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
tactical mask on so I run over to a I

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.180 
tactical mask on so I run over to a I
don't<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.180> anybody<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.650> decide<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.920> go<00:02:50.069> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
don't see anybody so I decide to go in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
don't see anybody so I decide to go in
and<00:02:50.280> plant<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> plant<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.530> then<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:54.140> I'm

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
and plant so I plant it and then as I'm

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.199 
and plant so I plant it and then as I'm
running<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.739> because<00:02:56.190> i<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.970> people

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
running back because i think that people

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.520 
running back because i think that people
are<00:02:57.390> coming<00:02:57.659> in<00:02:57.750> from<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.989> right<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.319> really

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
are coming in from the right but really

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.479 
are coming in from the right but really
they're<00:02:58.680> going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:58.950> coming<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.280> from<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
they're going to be coming in from the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.740 
they're going to be coming in from the
left<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.819> this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.390> way<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.569> play

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
left so this is really not a way to play

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.020 
left so this is really not a way to play
search<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> left<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.940> I'm

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
search so I go to the left think I'm

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.190 
search so I go to the left think I'm
gonna<00:03:03.150> flank<00:03:03.420> him<00:03:03.540> off<00:03:03.690> when<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:03.959> come<00:03:04.080> over

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
route I don't see anybody coming this is

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:46.820 
route I don't see anybody coming this is
a<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:45.959> good<00:03:46.110> rad<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.379> you're<00:03:46.500> playing<00:03:46.650> on

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
a really good rad if you're playing on

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.699 
a really good rad if you're playing on
snap<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.150> see<00:03:48.330> nobody<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> left<00:03:49.140> now

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
snap and I see nobody on the left now

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.199 
snap and I see nobody on the left now
I'm<00:03:49.890> thinking<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.310> they're<00:03:50.549> all<00:03:50.700> coming<00:03:51.030> in

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
I'm thinking that they're all coming in

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.850 
I'm thinking that they're all coming in
from<00:03:51.330> over<00:03:51.510> here<00:03:51.540> or<00:03:52.110> camping<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:52.680> least

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
from over here or camping at least

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.429 
from over here or camping at least
because<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.909> suspiciously<00:03:54.599> fast<00:03:54.900> so

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
because this is suspiciously fast so

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.809 
because this is suspiciously fast so
somebody<00:03:55.739> must<00:03:55.769> have<00:03:55.980> didn't<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.670> kill

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
somebody must have didn't want to kill

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.420 
somebody must have didn't want to kill
me<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.030> waited<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.769> start<00:03:59.010> planted

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
me and waited and so I start planted

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.699 
me and waited and so I start planted
because<00:03:59.819> I<00:03:59.909> planted<00:04:00.330> as<00:04:00.480> soon<00:04:01.080> as<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.319> run<00:04:01.530> back

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
because I planted as soon as I run back

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.229 
because I planted as soon as I run back
apparently<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.489> guy<00:04:02.610> did<00:04:02.760> not<00:04:02.879> want<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.090> kill

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
