00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:09.029
 how about people very good good days 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.029
 afternoon the purpose of this tutorial is 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.530
 transform an idea source to a source 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.530
 Exactly in days gone by I came across what 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.190
 I needed an exact source for a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.790
 computer and nothing else had a source 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.790
 connections and 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.790
 so 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.350
 I learned to transform it to make a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.180
 I work girl, not what we call her here 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.630
 Mexico 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.460
 gypsy work but that works at 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.840
 100 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.900
 Well the first thing I did was 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.579
 from a holy source that no longer serves 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.390
 was getting 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 in this case by the connection true 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.540
 the following 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.760
 here I have two connections 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.760
 from source the exact source 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.540
 the next thing is to get a source and from 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.420
 good condition 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.420
 ok the first thing that is done is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.850
 fight the wires the short 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.540
 from where you want 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.010
 from the source of the idea source we are going to 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.000
 have that we're going to have four wires 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.040
 I always start with yellow 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.280
 if you realize right away it's a cable 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.280
 black 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.970
 a third wire follows 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.300
 black and the fourth wire is a wire 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.300
 Red 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.409
 but it turns out that in the exact source 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.110
 because they are 4 removed because the first 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 it's a yellow wire the second is 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.190
 black the third is red and the fourth is 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.820
 black 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.890
 then who with whom good the first 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.200
 step is simple I always start by 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.190
 the yellow wire as he had told them 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 yellow stick with yellow 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.030
 this connection regularly brings five 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.630
 wires 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 we are going to discard the fifth wire 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.300
 the exact source after five wires that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.690
 it is clear the fifth wire we are going to 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.000
 discard ok the source and detracts four 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.170
 wires are the ones that we will use 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.660
 then as I had mentioned before 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.819
 let's let's start with the cable 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.819
 yellow 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.700
 in the sequence of the two of the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.980
 two connections in the sequence the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.010
 second wire is black up here 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.440
 we go 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.640
 very well 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.970
 then we put together black cables 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.700
 I repeat the first one is yellow 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.880
 the second one is black here is where 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.630
 can confuse a little bit because the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.830
 third wire from the source of the source 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.380
 and it is black and the sata connection is 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.420
 red but here so easy is so simple 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.060
 as as the two wires that are us 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.000
 leftover pasting red with red and black with 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.970
 black 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.950
 they will cross but it does not matter if it is red 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.950
 with red black with black 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.580
 and as I had mentioned before 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.990
 fifth alawrito 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.060
 of the connection sata ssd 6 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.060
 although we hit this whole thing 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:02.160
 we put our our respective 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.660
 in black so that no 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.190
 no short 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.430
 if they want to load the source 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.110
 if you are working what I recommend 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.110
 is to make a bridge 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.739
 is going to take in this way the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.639
 the connection 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.070
 in the fourth and fifth side of the clip 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:38.340
 this this clip is the insurance so that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.340
 it appears from the motherboard 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.180
 let's take it this way in the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.100
 fourth and the fifth is where we should 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.440
 make our 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.440
 our bridge we put a wire 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.529
 we make a bridge we connect our 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.709
 source 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:03.459
 here we connect our hard drive or 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:06.129
 we connect our mistakes and dry in 

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:09.539
 this case would be better than drying here with 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:13.329
 a cd-rom if the rom site turns on and opens 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.749
 well everything is correctly I hope they 

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.749
 I have served
