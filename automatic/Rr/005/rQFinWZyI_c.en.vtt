on with no music or anything you could

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.390 
on with no music or anything you could
tell<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.440> difference<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.920> it's<00:05:50.190> noise

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
tell the difference that it's noise

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.950 
tell the difference that it's noise
cancellation<00:05:51.060> now<00:05:51.690> both<00:05:52.530> of<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.860> logos<00:05:53.310> are
