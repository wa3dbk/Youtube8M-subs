00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.729
 information we are live these tv

 news center edition we thank you 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:13.150
 always your preference about 200,000 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.950
 drivers that work within the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.349
 businesses in the region lambayeque are going to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.789
 have to be trained to be able 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.669
 get the license to transport 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.669
 material and hazardous waste 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.620
 the comprehensive drivers school the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.420
 Amauta becomes the only entity 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 of training in the management of 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.110
 hazardous materials and waste 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.340
 authorized and accredited by the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.680
 Ministry of Transport and 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.270
 communications as required by law 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 which regulates this type of transfer 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.400
 terrestrial at least 200 thousand drivers 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.720
 who work within various companies 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.330
 they should be trained to obtain 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.640
 this special drivers license 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.460
 a minimum of 200 thousand is estimated 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.680
 drivers a minimum but I guess that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.370
 it must be something of 25 percent of the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.510
 national level 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.280
 level across the region does not go the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320
 cost will be directly related 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.030
 the classification of the groups according to 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 law from January next year 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.940
 must comply with what is ordered by the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.680
 norm so unfailingly 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.050
 they must take the courses of 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.940
 specialized basic training and their 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.830
 respective updates and the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 resolution of the ministry that does not give 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.159
 difference of a drivers school 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 that the course is dictated in the same 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.330
 school here there is no flexibility because 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.580
 because the company can not stop its 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.590
 activities imagine sending your 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.730
 drivers lose four days of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.320
 work is pecuniaryly that difficult 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.760
 then we go to his 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 mining camp its platform 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.740
 oil in the end we go if not 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 there is a problem courteous gutierrez indicated 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.730
 that your represented is oriented to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.430
 perform in the same companies said 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.680
 training whose cost fluctuates between 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 number of existing workers are 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.530
 two day of course and the third day we have 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.260
 certificates 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.580
 how I say depends a lot on the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.610
 number of students that there are two groups 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.860
 or a thousand soles the least I calculate is like 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.660
 I say they are referential prisoners, no, 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.270
 it's about training more 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.270
 people without abusing pocket no
