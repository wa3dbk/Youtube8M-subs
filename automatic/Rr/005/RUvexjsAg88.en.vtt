00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
and just woke up to it well man we were

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.359 
and just woke up to it well man we were
hoping<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.350> was<00:01:11.530> going<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.710> be<00:01:11.770> no<00:01:11.800> doubt<00:01:12.130> we

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
hoping that was going to be no doubt we

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.990 
hoping that was going to be no doubt we
were<00:01:12.430> going<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.640> pass<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:13.119> but

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
were going to pass it but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.550 
were going to pass it but
I<00:01:14.090> think<00:01:14.660> to<00:01:14.780> get<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.050> weight<00:01:15.200> off<00:01:15.230> our

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
I think to get the weight off our

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.720 
I think to get the weight off our
shoulders<00:01:15.620> and<00:01:16.010> now<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.490> look

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
shoulders and now we can just look

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.310 
shoulders and now we can just look
forward<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.240> get<00:01:17.570> on<00:01:17.720> with<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.990> month<00:01:18.170> I

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
forward and get on with the month I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.690 
forward and get on with the month I
think<00:01:18.350> that's<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.740> biggest<00:01:18.920> thing<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.370> of

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
think that's the biggest thing and of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.010 
think that's the biggest thing and of
course<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.180> feels<00:01:20.360> good<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:20.870> pretty

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
next steps on the car but it's a long

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.710 
next steps on the car but it's a long
month<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.460> I'm<00:02:35.180> used<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.420> getting<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
month so I'm used to getting to a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.570 
month so I'm used to getting to a
racetrack<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:37.100> into<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.490> and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
racetrack and get into it and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.610 
racetrack and get into it and
and<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.330> trying<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.960> get<00:02:41.020> every<00:02:41.200> last<00:02:41.320> drop

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
and and trying to get every last drop

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
and and trying to get every last drop
out<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> car<00:02:42.160> right<00:02:42.370> away<00:02:42.460> but<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
out of the car right away but here you

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.260 
out of the car right away but here you
can't<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.610> got<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:45.940> take<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
can't do that so you got to just take it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.630 
can't do that so you got to just take it
step<00:02:46.360> by<00:02:46.480> step
