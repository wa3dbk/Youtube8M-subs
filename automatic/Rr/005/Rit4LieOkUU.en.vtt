hi<00:00:00.719> everybody<00:00:01.020> here's<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.890> look<00:00:02.129> at<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.399> repair

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi everybody here's a look at a repair

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.829 
hi everybody here's a look at a repair
slash<00:00:03.419> mod<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.830> did<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.359> used<00:00:06.629> these

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
slash mod that I did and I used these

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.049 
slash mod that I did and I used these
current-limiting<00:00:07.410> diodes<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.340> really<00:00:08.820> came

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
current-limiting diodes that really came

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.959 
current-limiting diodes that really came
in<00:00:09.240> handy<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.929> did<00:00:10.260> another<00:00:10.590> video<00:00:10.920> about<00:00:11.519> these

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
in handy I did another video about these

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
in handy I did another video about these
where<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> put<00:00:12.540> them<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> curve<00:00:13.170> tracer<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
where I put them on the curve tracer and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.439 
where I put them on the curve tracer and
you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.770> I'll<00:00:16.770> link<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.279> into<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.029> video

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
you can I'll link that into this video

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.310 
you can I'll link that into this video
but<00:00:19.350> basically<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.369> whole<00:00:20.550> project<00:00:21.320> started

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
but basically the whole project started

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
but basically the whole project started
when<00:00:22.880> when<00:00:23.880> somebody<00:00:24.420> came<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
when when somebody came to me with a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480 
when when somebody came to me with a
broken<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> burnt-out<00:00:27.990> light<00:00:28.769> bulb<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
broken or a burnt-out light bulb that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.250 
broken or a burnt-out light bulb that
was<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.179> back<00:00:30.480> light<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.769> his<00:00:32.099> car<00:00:32.550> stereo

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
was the back light for his car stereo

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.130 
was the back light for his car stereo
LCD<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.550> said<00:00:35.550> yeah<00:00:35.790> sure<00:00:36.059> no<00:00:36.300> problem<00:00:36.600> hey<00:00:36.960> how

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
LCD I said yeah sure no problem hey how

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.770 
LCD I said yeah sure no problem hey how
about<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.460> blue<00:00:38.730> LEDs<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.570> there

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
about I put some blue LEDs in there

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.360 
about I put some blue LEDs in there
instead<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.160> have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
instead so you can you know have

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.130 
instead so you can you know have
something<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.180> interesting<00:00:42.960> than

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
something a little more interesting than

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
something a little more interesting than
boring<00:00:44.040> old<00:00:44.190> light<00:00:44.430> bulb<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.969> said<00:00:45.239> sure

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
boring old light bulb and he said sure

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.130 
boring old light bulb and he said sure
so<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.440> started<00:00:47.190> looking<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.960> here's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so I started looking at it see here's

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.250 
so I started looking at it see here's
the<00:00:49.230> front<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> there's<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.260> there

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the front and there's the back and there

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.150 
the front and there's the back and there
was<00:00:52.730> my<00:00:53.730> first<00:00:54.239> problem<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> ran<00:00:55.110> into<00:00:55.800> was

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
was my first problem that I ran into was

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.000 
was my first problem that I ran into was
that<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.399> had<00:00:56.730> no<00:00:57.420> idea<00:00:57.559> what<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.739> positive

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that I had no idea what was positive

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.910 
that I had no idea what was positive
what<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.550> negative<00:00:59.699> there's<00:01:00.390> no<00:01:00.920> polarized

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what was negative there's no polarized

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.960 
what was negative there's no polarized
caps<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.210> no<00:01:04.159> LEDs<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> either

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
caps on it there's no LEDs on and either

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.420 
caps on it there's no LEDs on and either
and<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.600> fact<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.950> green

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and in fact all these little green

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.969 
and in fact all these little green
surface<00:01:09.030> mount<00:01:09.270> things<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> front<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
surface mount things on the front you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.210 
surface mount things on the front you
think<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.490> LEDs<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.270> they're<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:13.220> just

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
think they're LEDs but they're not just

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
think they're LEDs but they're not just
look<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> close-up<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.500> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
look at a close-up here and you can see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
look at a close-up here and you can see
the<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.850> filament<00:01:18.479> inside<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.170> light<00:01:19.530> bulb

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the the filament inside a light bulb

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.690 
the the filament inside a light bulb
that's<00:01:20.580> inside<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> green<00:01:22.409> silicon<00:01:23.369> rubber

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that's inside of a green silicon rubber

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.260 
that's inside of a green silicon rubber
cover<00:01:24.590> very<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:26.009> interesting<00:01:26.700> even<00:01:27.090> though

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
cover very very interesting even though

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.399 
cover very very interesting even though
this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.659> from<00:01:28.369> 1994<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.960> surprised

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this is from 1994 I was really surprised

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
this is from 1994 I was really surprised
that<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.369> using<00:01:32.549> light<00:01:32.880> bulbs

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that they would be using light bulbs

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
that they would be using light bulbs
instead<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.689> green<00:01:33.930> LEDs<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.850> certainly

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
instead of green LEDs which certainly

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
instead of green LEDs which certainly
did<00:01:36.180> exist<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:36.900> maybe<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:37.890> green

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
did exist back then maybe these green

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
did exist back then maybe these green
LEDs<00:01:38.970> were<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:39.600> expensive<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.409> too

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
LEDs were just too expensive or too

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730 
LEDs were just too expensive or too
unreliable<00:01:41.060> I'm<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.990> sure<00:01:43.259> why<00:01:43.500> they

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
unreliable I'm really not sure why they

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
unreliable I'm really not sure why they
would<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.159> light<00:01:44.399> bulbs<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> anyway<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
would go with light bulbs but anyway of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.639 
would go with light bulbs but anyway of
course<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.979> I'm<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:48.350> replacing<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
course if I'm gonna be replacing the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.789 
course if I'm gonna be replacing the
back<00:01:50.369> light<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> blue<00:01:51.750> LED<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.619> need

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
back light with a blue LED then I need

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
back light with a blue LED then I need
to<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.220> polarity<00:01:53.729> since<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> didn't<00:01:55.049> know

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to know the polarity since I didn't know

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
to know the polarity since I didn't know
that<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.740> threw<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:58.040> very<00:01:59.040> tiny<00:01:59.509> full<00:02:00.509> way

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that I threw in a very tiny full way

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.800 
that I threw in a very tiny full way
bridge<00:02:01.049> rectifier<00:02:02.060> little<00:02:03.060> tiny<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.600> made

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
bridge rectifier little tiny thing made

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.649 
bridge rectifier little tiny thing made
by<00:02:03.990> Motorola<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> ran<00:02:06.240> into<00:02:06.540> another

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
by Motorola but then I ran into another

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.040 
by Motorola but then I ran into another
problem<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> didn't<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
problem and that is I didn't know the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
problem and that is I didn't know the
original<00:02:10.830> voltage<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:11.970> applied<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
original voltage that was applied to the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.740 
original voltage that was applied to the
the<00:02:13.439> backlight<00:02:13.950> light<00:02:14.489> bulb<00:02:14.819> couldn't<00:02:15.629> see

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the backlight light bulb couldn't see

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.990 
the backlight light bulb couldn't see
any<00:02:15.930> markings<00:02:16.409> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> board<00:02:16.980> anywhere<00:02:17.609> that

any markings on the board anywhere that
hinted<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.810> voltage<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.319> mean<00:02:19.469> of<00:02:19.590> course<00:02:19.829> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
hinted at the voltage I mean of course I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.670 
hinted at the voltage I mean of course I
would<00:02:20.189> assume<00:02:20.489> 12<00:02:20.909> volts<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.329> begin<00:02:21.689> with<00:02:21.900> but

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
would assume 12 volts to begin with but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.209 
would assume 12 volts to begin with but
when<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.980> only<00:02:23.340> applied<00:02:23.849> 5<00:02:24.209> volts<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> these

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
when I only applied 5 volts to these

green<00:02:26.219> coded<00:02:27.090> light<00:02:27.299> bulbs<00:02:27.750> they<00:02:28.019> they<00:02:28.560> seemed

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
green coded light bulbs they they seemed

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.500 
green coded light bulbs they they seemed
to<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.040> very<00:02:29.129> bright<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:29.939> didn't<00:02:30.239> want<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
to be very bright and I didn't want to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.509 
to be very bright and I didn't want to
apply<00:02:30.780> anymore<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.189> afraid<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
apply anymore because I was afraid of

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.849 
apply anymore because I was afraid of
burning<00:02:32.879> them<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.079> since<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.530> really

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
burning them out and so since I really

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.080 
burning them out and so since I really
didn't<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:35.430> any<00:02:35.790> concrete<00:02:36.569> idea<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
didn't have any concrete idea of the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
didn't have any concrete idea of the
voltage<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> would<00:02:39.569> be<00:02:39.810> applied<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
voltage that would be applied to the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.839 
voltage that would be applied to the
backlight<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.560> didn't<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.730> to

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
backlight and I really didn't want to

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.289 
backlight and I really didn't want to
just<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.370> resistor<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.639> series<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
just have a resistor in series with the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.110 
just have a resistor in series with the
LED<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.260> LED<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:50.010> vary<00:02:50.879> in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
LED because the LED would vary in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.059 
LED because the LED would vary in
brightness<00:02:51.299> according<00:02:52.169> to<00:02:52.319> whatever<00:02:52.500> voltage

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
brightness according to whatever voltage

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.099 
brightness according to whatever voltage
gets<00:02:53.280> applied<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.870> come

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
gets applied to it that's where we come

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.349 
gets applied to it that's where we come

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
to these current limiting diodes I used

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.500 
to these current limiting diodes I used
the<00:02:57.540> 1n<00:02:58.220> 5305<00:02:59.780> I<00:03:00.780> use<00:03:01.079> 4<00:03:01.439> of<00:03:01.560> them<00:03:01.680> -<00:03:02.150> 2<00:03:03.150> pairs

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the 1n 5305 I use 4 of them - 2 pairs

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.690 
the 1n 5305 I use 4 of them - 2 pairs
one<00:03:04.409> pair<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.099> each<00:03:05.370> blue<00:03:06.239> LED<00:03:06.810> here's<00:03:07.409> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
one pair for each blue LED here's the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.479 
one pair for each blue LED here's the
circuit<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.879> schematic<00:03:09.419> just<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.799> two

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
circuit the schematic just got the two

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.509 
circuit the schematic just got the two
input<00:03:11.970> terminals<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.799> they<00:03:13.799> go<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.310> full

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
input terminals and they go to the full

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.830 
input terminals and they go to the full
wave<00:03:14.700> bridge<00:03:14.730> rectifier<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.870> then<00:03:16.159> output<00:03:17.159> to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
wave bridge rectifier and then output to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.250 
wave bridge rectifier and then output to
two<00:03:18.840> branches<00:03:19.470> each<00:03:19.739> one<00:03:20.069> with<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> couple<00:03:21.060> of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
two branches each one with a couple of

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.050 
two branches each one with a couple of
current<00:03:22.260> limiting<00:03:22.560> diodes<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.250> LED<00:03:23.699> so

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
current limiting diodes and the LED so

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.800 
current limiting diodes and the LED so
each<00:03:24.299> LED<00:03:24.810> gets<00:03:25.639> 4<00:03:26.639> milliamps<00:03:27.389> flowing

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
each LED gets 4 milliamps flowing

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.589 
each LED gets 4 milliamps flowing
through<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.229> and<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:29.340> reason<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.699> use<00:03:29.879> 2<00:03:30.150> LEDs

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
through it and the reason I use 2 LEDs

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.170 
through it and the reason I use 2 LEDs
in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> first<00:03:31.109> place<00:03:31.409> is<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.430> was<00:03:32.699> was

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
in the first place is because I was was

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.000 
in the first place is because I was was
not<00:03:33.209> satisfied<00:03:34.049> with<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.349> brightness

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
not satisfied with the brightness

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.110 
not satisfied with the brightness
acquired<00:03:35.519> by<00:03:35.790> only<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.389> LED<00:03:37.310> also<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.579> didn't

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
acquired by only one LED also I didn't

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.360 
acquired by only one LED also I didn't
have<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> lot<00:03:39.569> of<00:03:39.599> space<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.290> work<00:03:40.590> with<00:03:40.919> so<00:03:41.340> I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
have a lot of space to work with so I

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.059 
have a lot of space to work with so I
had<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.909> file<00:03:42.239> down<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.989> plastic<00:03:43.229> winds<00:03:43.709> of

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
had to file down the plastic winds of

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.670 
had to file down the plastic winds of
these<00:03:44.299> LEDs<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.329> little<00:03:45.750> bit<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.079> flatten<00:03:46.530> them

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
these LEDs a little bit and flatten them

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.899 
these LEDs a little bit and flatten them
out<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.159> then<00:03:48.120> mount<00:03:49.079> them<00:03:49.379> on<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.220> thing<00:03:50.519> so

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
out and then mount them on the thing so

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.539 
out and then mount them on the thing so
that<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.419> light<00:03:51.780> shines<00:03:51.810> directly<00:03:52.680> into<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
that the light shines directly into the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.759 
that the light shines directly into the
the<00:03:53.970> plastic<00:03:54.239> wedge<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.139> goes<00:03:55.379> underneath

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
the plastic wedge that goes underneath

board<00:03:58.979> we've<00:03:59.669> got<00:03:59.879> all<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.180> parts<00:04:00.389> here

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
board we've got all the parts here

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.559 
board we've got all the parts here
there's<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.500> full<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> bridge<00:04:02.970> on<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.359> left

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
there's the full a bridge on the left

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.469 
there's the full a bridge on the left
and<00:04:03.840> then<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.169> 2<00:04:04.379> pairs<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:05.479> the

and then the 2 pairs of the
current-limiting<00:04:06.900> diodes<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.949> I<00:04:08.250> did<00:04:08.489> put

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
current-limiting diodes and I did put

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.449 
current-limiting diodes and I did put
some<00:04:08.939> insulation<00:04:09.739> underneath<00:04:10.739> these<00:04:11.129> things

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
some insulation underneath these things

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.429 
some insulation underneath these things
once<00:04:11.759> I<00:04:11.939> finished<00:04:12.389> just<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.930> make<00:04:13.109> sure<00:04:13.259> that

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
once I finished just to make sure that

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.990 
once I finished just to make sure that
those<00:04:13.590> wires<00:04:13.889> don't<00:04:14.189> touch<00:04:14.519> any<00:04:14.729> of<00:04:14.819> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
those wires don't touch any of the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.589 
those wires don't touch any of the
surface<00:04:15.239> mount<00:04:15.540> resistors<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.880> once<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.449> was

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
surface mount resistors but once it was

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.550 
surface mount resistors but once it was
finished<00:04:18.810> then<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:20.370> LEDs<00:04:20.880> shine<00:04:21.570> very<00:04:21.930> very

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
finished then the LEDs shine very very

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.830 
finished then the LEDs shine very very
well<00:04:22.830> also<00:04:23.400> hook<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.760> up<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.029> 12<00:04:24.300> volts<00:04:24.659> and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
well also hook it up to 12 volts and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120

these<00:04:25.830> two<00:04:26.070> pictures<00:04:26.340> show

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
these two pictures show

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.760 
these two pictures show
that<00:04:27.430> no<00:04:28.240> matter<00:04:28.450> what<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> polarity<00:04:29.500> whether

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
that no matter what the polarity whether

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.600 
that no matter what the polarity whether
it's<00:04:30.070> one<00:04:30.400> way<00:04:30.670> or<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.510> other<00:04:31.810> way<00:04:32.250> they<00:04:33.250> still

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
it's one way or the other way they still

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's one way or the other way they still
light<00:04:33.880> up<00:04:33.910> doesn't<00:04:34.480> matter<00:04:34.660> which<00:04:35.380> way<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
light up doesn't matter which way the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.600 
light up doesn't matter which way the
polarity<00:04:36.190> goes<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:38.100> here's<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.280> finished

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
polarity goes and here's the finished

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.270 
polarity goes and here's the finished
product<00:04:39.880> with<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:41.080> original<00:04:41.260> cover<00:04:41.800> put

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
product with the the original cover put

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.750 
product with the the original cover put
back<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.900> with<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.930> LEDs<00:04:44.380> inside<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.890> put<00:04:45.100> hot

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
back on with the LEDs inside I put hot

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.000 
back on with the LEDs inside I put hot
glue<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.240> LEDs<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.470> hold<00:04:47.680> them<00:04:47.830> in

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
glue on the LEDs to just to hold them in

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.540 
glue on the LEDs to just to hold them in
place

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
place

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.090 
place
and<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.750> gave<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.380> guy<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.860> it

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
and I gave it to the guy and it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.100 
and I gave it to the guy and it
apparently<00:04:51.910> works<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.420> haven't<00:04:52.750> heard<00:04:52.960> from

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
apparently works I haven't heard from

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.110 
apparently works I haven't heard from
him<00:04:53.260> since<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.830> guess<00:04:54.130> everything's<00:04:54.580> okay

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
him since so I guess everything's okay

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.540 
him since so I guess everything's okay
I<00:04:55.170> made<00:04:56.170> some<00:04:56.380> cash<00:04:56.590> off<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:57.040> this<00:04:57.130> repair<00:04:57.520> a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
I made some cash off of this repair a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.970 
I made some cash off of this repair a
job<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.420> and<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.230> these<00:04:59.410> little<00:04:59.740> tiny

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
job and I and I have these little tiny

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.190 
job and I and I have these little tiny
vintage<00:05:00.520> components<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.300> think<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.810> can<00:05:01.990> see

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
vintage components to think you can see

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.460 
vintage components to think you can see
the<00:05:02.410> one<00:05:03.000> diode<00:05:04.000> here<00:05:04.420> one<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:05.020> them<00:05:05.170> on<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
the one diode here one of them on the

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.660 
the one diode here one of them on the
right<00:05:05.620> side<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.220> dated<00:05:06.700> from<00:05:07.530> 1978<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:09.460> these

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
right side is dated from 1978 so these

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.640 
right side is dated from 1978 so these
things<00:05:09.910> have<00:05:10.120> been<00:05:10.210> sitting<00:05:10.480> around<00:05:10.630> for<00:05:10.930> 35

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
things have been sitting around for 35

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.130 
things have been sitting around for 35
years<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.190> finally<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:13.090> used<00:05:13.480> four<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.990> them

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
years and finally I used four of them

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.490 
years and finally I used four of them
for<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:14.790> particular<00:05:15.790> job<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:17.050> there<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.350> go

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
for this particular job so there you go

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.320 
for this particular job so there you go
that's<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.860> perfect<00:05:18.220> example<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.790> what<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.030> like

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
that's a perfect example of what I like

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.920 
that's a perfect example of what I like
to<00:05:19.480> call<00:05:19.540> design<00:05:20.200> for<00:05:20.620> ambiguity<00:05:21.420> because<00:05:22.420> I

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
to call design for ambiguity because I

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.780 
to call design for ambiguity because I
really<00:05:23.320> didn't<00:05:23.680> really<00:05:24.130> had<00:05:24.280> very<00:05:24.310> little

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
really didn't really had very little

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.090 
really didn't really had very little
information<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.900> go<00:05:26.080> by<00:05:26.290> with<00:05:26.590> this<00:05:26.740> thing<00:05:26.980> I

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
information to go by with this thing I

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.940 
information to go by with this thing I
had<00:05:27.400> no<00:05:27.640> idea<00:05:27.790> what<00:05:28.300> what<00:05:29.230> kind<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.740> make

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
had no idea what what kind of make

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.600 
had no idea what what kind of make
remodel<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.760> radio<00:05:31.090> was<00:05:31.450> and<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:33.310> really

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
remodel the radio was and I and I really

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.760 
remodel the radio was and I and I really
didn't<00:05:33.940> didn't<00:05:34.660> really<00:05:34.840> need<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.290> because<00:05:35.530> I

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
didn't didn't really need to because I

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.300 
didn't didn't really need to because I
was<00:05:36.160> able<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:38.110> design<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.560> circuit<00:05:38.860> that

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
was able to to design a circuit that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.390 
was able to to design a circuit that
worked<00:05:39.970> under<00:05:40.330> almost<00:05:40.510> any<00:05:41.400> circumstances

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
worked under almost any circumstances
