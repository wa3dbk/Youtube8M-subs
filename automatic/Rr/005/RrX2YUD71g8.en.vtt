over<00:00:13.660> 22<00:00:14.230> part<00:00:14.589> 2<00:00:14.919> and<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.359> previous<00:00:16.570> video

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
over 22 part 2 and in the previous video

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.480 
over 22 part 2 and in the previous video
we<00:00:17.020> looked<00:00:17.140> at<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.529> inbuilt<00:00:17.920> flush<00:00:18.220> or<00:00:18.400> at

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
we looked at the inbuilt flush or at

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.970 
we looked at the inbuilt flush or at
least<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.759> menus<00:00:19.090> for<00:00:19.300> it<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.650> what<00:00:20.949> I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
least the menus for it and so what I

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.810 
least the menus for it and so what I
want<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.220> call<00:00:21.340> it<00:00:21.369> is<00:00:21.550> some<00:00:21.700> of<00:00:21.759> the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
want to call it is some of the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.790 
want to call it is some of the
fundamentals<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.539> flash<00:00:22.930> exposure<00:00:23.320> and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
fundamentals of flash exposure and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.409 
fundamentals of flash exposure and
before<00:00:24.430> we<00:00:24.460> go<00:00:24.550> to<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:24.849> next<00:00:24.970> part<00:00:25.270> of<00:00:25.300> the

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
before we go to the next part of the

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.560 
before we go to the next part of the
video<00:00:25.509> also<00:00:25.900> in<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.560> next<00:00:26.939> video<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.300> with

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
video also in the next video and with

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.140 
video also in the next video and with
for<00:00:28.900> video<00:00:29.140> 22<00:00:29.679> and<00:00:30.609> when<00:00:30.849> i'm<00:00:30.939> going<00:00:31.089> to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
for video 22 and when i'm going to

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150 
for video 22 and when i'm going to
shooting<00:00:31.480> portraits<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:32.259> head<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:32.890> shoulder

look at the menus last time i mentioned

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200 
look at the menus last time i mentioned
also<00:00:47.559> lost<00:00:47.920> time<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.489> you<00:00:48.670> have<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.910> maximum

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
also lost time that you have a maximum

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.729 
also lost time that you have a maximum
shutter<00:00:49.600> speed<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.260> use<00:00:50.440> with

cameras are consumer high shutter speed
some<00:01:00.399> only<00:01:00.670> lord<00:01:01.359> so<00:01:02.260> we're<00:01:02.859> limited<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
some only lord so we're limited to that

ok<00:01:07.420> now<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.259> flash<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.369> fully

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
ok now the flash in this is fully

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.389 
ok now the flash in this is fully

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
what flash exposure is required based on

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.669 
what flash exposure is required based on

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
and the distance to the subject so just

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.249 
and the distance to the subject so just
to<00:01:24.039> clarify<00:01:24.190> on<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.819> normally<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.929> exposure

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
to clarify on that normally for exposure

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.800 
to clarify on that normally for exposure
we<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.619> shutter<00:01:26.830> speed<00:01:27.160> aperture<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.179> ISO

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
we have shutter speed aperture and ISO

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.260 
we have shutter speed aperture and ISO
and<00:01:29.099> that<00:01:30.099> will<00:01:30.220> be<00:01:30.310> for<00:01:30.459> any<00:01:30.670> am<00:01:30.910> beyond<00:01:31.149> my

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
and that will be for any am beyond my

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.630

aperture the more like gets through the
smaller<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.399> aperture<00:02:06.849> then<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.179> last

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
smaller for the aperture then the last

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.029 
smaller for the aperture then the last
light<00:02:07.629> gets<00:02:07.869> through<00:02:08.080> or<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.349> smaller<00:02:08.649> window

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
light gets through or the smaller window

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.030 
light gets through or the smaller window
is<00:02:09.220> now<00:02:09.459> your<00:02:10.390> ISO<00:02:10.869> remember<00:02:11.379> increases<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
is now your ISO remember increases the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.580 
is now your ISO remember increases the

sensitivity of the camera to any given

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890 
sensitivity of the camera to any given
might<00:02:14.800> be<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:15.940> within<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.480> ambien

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
might be that right within your ambien

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.970 
might be that right within your ambien
location<00:02:17.770> indoors<00:02:18.700> outdoors<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.709> or<00:02:20.709> your

location indoors outdoors and or your
flash<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.299> could<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:22.689> be<00:02:22.810> using<00:02:23.170> unmute

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
flash and you could well be using unmute

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920 
flash and you could well be using unmute
light<00:02:24.159> and<00:02:24.370> flush<00:02:24.760> together

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
light and flush together

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.709 
light and flush together
your<00:02:26.109> ISO<00:02:26.530> will<00:02:26.799> affect<00:02:27.069> both<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.489> those<00:02:27.719> but

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
your ISO will affect both of those but

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.059 
your ISO will affect both of those but
what<00:02:28.930> actually<00:02:29.019> affects<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.739> flash

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
what actually affects your flash

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.119 
what actually affects your flash
exposure<00:02:30.870> okay<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.019> have<00:02:32.200> an<00:02:32.349> automatic<00:02:32.680> flush

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
exposure okay we have an automatic flush

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.429 
exposure okay we have an automatic flush
in<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.209> larger<00:02:34.840> flash<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
in this and the larger flash is that you

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.500 
in this and the larger flash is that you
can<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.739> for<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.129> camera<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.239> canon

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
can get for your camera like the canon

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.229 
can get for your camera like the canon
430ex<00:02:37.750> two<00:02:38.560> will<00:02:39.040> run<00:02:39.189> in<00:02:39.340> ettl<00:02:39.939> as<00:02:40.090> well

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
430ex two will run in ettl as well

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.420 
430ex two will run in ettl as well
that's<00:02:40.450> automatic<00:02:41.019> but<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.769> can<00:02:41.890> also<00:02:41.980> want

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
that's automatic but it can also want

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.229 
that's automatic but it can also want
manual<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:44.409> we<00:02:45.219> can<00:02:45.459> actually<00:02:45.639> set<00:02:45.969> flash

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
manual so we can actually set flash

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.000 
manual so we can actually set flash
power<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.689> is<00:02:46.840> one<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.139> one<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.799> main

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
power that is one of the one of the main

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.520 
power that is one of the one of the main
variables<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.819> flash<00:02:49.090> exposure<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.319> flash

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
variables of flash exposure is the flash

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.009 
variables of flash exposure is the flash
power<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.489> camera<00:02:51.819> determines<00:02:52.389> that<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:52.810> us

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
power the camera determines that for us

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.860 
power the camera determines that for us
because<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.650> automatic<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.750> were

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
because this is automatic if we were

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.009 
because this is automatic if we were
running<00:02:56.079> manual<00:02:56.560> flush<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.629> we<00:02:58.720> say

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
running manual flush and if we say

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.080 
running manual flush and if we say
mounted<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.439> 430ex<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.310> put<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.609> into<00:03:00.790> manual

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
mounted the 430ex to put it into manual

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.909 
mounted the 430ex to put it into manual
then<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:01.900> could<00:03:02.049> choose<00:03:02.290> what<00:03:02.530> power<00:03:02.739> we

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
then we could choose what power we

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.099 
then we could choose what power we
wanted<00:03:03.310> be<00:03:03.939> that<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.329> sixty-fourth<00:03:04.900> power

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
wanted be that one sixty-fourth power

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.750 
wanted be that one sixty-fourth power
core<00:03:05.439> of<00:03:05.560> our<00:03:05.680> half<00:03:05.950> power<00:03:06.250> full<00:03:06.549> power

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
core of our half power full power

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.720 
core of our half power full power
whatever<00:03:07.620> okay<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.040> only<00:03:09.250> other<00:03:09.370> things

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
whatever okay so the only other things

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.909 
whatever okay so the only other things
really<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.150> we<00:03:10.419> need<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.569> consider<00:03:10.919> okay

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
really that we need to consider okay

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.319 
really that we need to consider okay
because<00:03:12.159> we<00:03:12.310> can't<00:03:12.549> really<00:03:12.790> control<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
because we can't really control the

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.839 
because we can't really control the
output<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.049> other<00:03:14.769> than<00:03:14.980> adding<00:03:15.519> flash

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
output of this other than adding flash

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.520 
output of this other than adding flash
exposure<00:03:16.209> compensation<00:03:16.540> which<00:03:17.230> isn't<00:03:17.469> really

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
exposure compensation which isn't really

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.699 
exposure compensation which isn't really
telling<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.159> fire<00:03:18.459> at<00:03:18.760> half<00:03:19.510> power<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:20.560> was

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
telling it to fire at half power it was

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.619 
telling it to fire at half power it was
telling<00:03:21.069> I<00:03:21.189> want<00:03:21.459> one<00:03:21.700> more<00:03:21.849> stop<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.239> light<00:03:22.419> or

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
telling I want one more stop of light or

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.050 
telling I want one more stop of light or
one<00:03:22.930> less<00:03:23.139> stop<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.530> line<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.849> only<00:03:24.969> other

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
one less stop of line so the only other

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.099 
one less stop of line so the only other
elements<00:03:25.510> are<00:03:25.659> your<00:03:25.840> aperture<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.500> your<00:03:27.310> ISO

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
elements are your aperture and your ISO

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.240 
elements are your aperture and your ISO
okay<00:03:29.109> your<00:03:29.290> aperture<00:03:29.500> remember<00:03:30.099> is<00:03:30.220> that

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
okay your aperture remember is that

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.550 
okay your aperture remember is that
opening<00:03:30.790> within<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.090> lens<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.540> if<00:03:31.690> it's<00:03:31.840> 1.8

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
opening within the lens so if it's 1.8

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.159 
opening within the lens so if it's 1.8
we<00:03:32.889> are<00:03:33.010> we<00:03:33.099> at<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.190> moment<00:03:33.549> 1.8<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.389> big

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
we are we at the moment 1.8 on this big

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.539 
we are we at the moment 1.8 on this big
wide<00:03:35.379> window<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.889> going<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.099> let<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> ton<00:03:36.519> of

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
wide window is going to let a ton of

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.219 
wide window is going to let a ton of
light<00:03:36.819> through<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.349> your<00:03:38.349> ISO<00:03:38.949> okay<00:03:39.909> well<00:03:40.750> as

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
light through and your ISO okay well as

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.929 
light through and your ISO okay well as
we<00:03:41.500> increase<00:03:41.919> it<00:03:42.129> increases<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.669> sensitivity

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
we increase it increases the sensitivity

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.569 
we increase it increases the sensitivity
to<00:03:43.629> light<00:03:43.750> as<00:03:43.989> well<00:03:44.199> what<00:03:45.069> are<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.250> thing<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
to light as well what are the thing to

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.179 
to light as well what are the thing to
remember<00:03:45.720> as<00:03:46.720> well<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.319> if<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:47.680> move<00:03:48.010> this

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
remember as well is if we move this

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.039 
remember as well is if we move this
flush<00:03:48.549> remember<00:03:49.299> this<00:03:49.389> is<00:03:49.569> a<00:03:49.599> line<00:03:49.840> source

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
flush remember this is a line source

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.740 
flush remember this is a line source
closer<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:51.519> your<00:03:51.699> subject<00:03:51.879> then<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.659> gets

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
closer to your subject then it gets

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.319 
closer to your subject then it gets
brighter<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.609> move<00:03:54.699> it<00:03:54.849> further<00:03:55.060> away

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
brighter as you can move it further away

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.809 
brighter as you can move it further away
it<00:03:55.659> will<00:03:56.049> get<00:03:56.229> darker<00:03:56.709> now<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.579> will

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
it will get darker now this will

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.089 
it will get darker now this will
actually<00:03:58.000> meter<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.229> set<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.889> flash

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
actually meter and set the flash

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.610 
actually meter and set the flash
exposure<00:04:00.659> ultimately<00:04:01.659> if<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.199> were<00:04:02.409> running

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
exposure ultimately if we were running

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.259 
exposure ultimately if we were running
manual<00:04:03.159> flash<00:04:03.370> then<00:04:03.579> we<00:04:03.669> will<00:04:03.790> have<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:04.090> either

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
manual flash then we will have to either

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.649 
manual flash then we will have to either
increase<00:04:04.599> or<00:04:04.959> decrease<00:04:05.199> the<00:04:05.680> power<00:04:05.859> and

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
increase or decrease the power and

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.159 
increase or decrease the power and
accordingly<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.709> your<00:04:09.069> aperture<00:04:10.169> ISO

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
accordingly so we have your aperture ISO

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.189 
accordingly so we have your aperture ISO
and<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:12.129> distance<00:04:13.120> between<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.629> flush<00:04:13.959> or

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
and the distance between the flush or

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.620 
and the distance between the flush or
light<00:04:14.470> source<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:15.159> your<00:04:15.310> subjects<00:04:15.879> which

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
light source to your subjects which

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.259 
light source to your subjects which
determine<00:04:17.169> our<00:04:17.320> flash<00:04:17.590> exposure<00:04:17.970> yes<00:04:18.970> flash

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
determine our flash exposure yes flash

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.300 
determine our flash exposure yes flash
power<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.720> part<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.500> we<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.859> no<00:04:21.070> say

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
power is part of that but we have no say

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.670 
power is part of that but we have no say
on<00:04:21.519> what<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.449> does<00:04:22.630> flash<00:04:22.900> power<00:04:23.139> rise<00:04:23.349> other

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
on what this does flash power rise other

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.060 
on what this does flash power rise other
than<00:04:23.889> adding<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.280> bit<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.460> compensation<00:04:26.070> okay

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
than adding a bit of compensation okay

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.909 
than adding a bit of compensation okay
so<00:04:27.130> what<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.639> wanted<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.880> make<00:04:28.090> sure<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:29.710> this

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
so what I wanted to make sure is in this

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.339 
so what I wanted to make sure is in this
video<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.750> following<00:04:31.750> on<00:04:31.810> from<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> last<00:04:32.229> one

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
video and following on from the last one

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.570 
video and following on from the last one
is<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> understood<00:04:33.190> some<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.430> these

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
is that you understood some of these

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300 
is that you understood some of these
basics<00:04:34.120> before<00:04:34.960> we<00:04:35.260> go<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.620> next<00:04:35.710> part<00:04:36.010> of

basics before we go to the next part of

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.560 
basics before we go to the next part of
the<00:04:36.580> video<00:04:36.669> which<00:04:36.969> is<00:04:37.000> going<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.300> be<00:04:37.389> on

next video what can be done with this
and<00:04:51.950> this<00:04:52.820> limitations<00:04:53.540> is<00:04:53.660> well<00:04:53.870> given<00:04:54.230> its

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
and this limitations is well given its

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.970 
and this limitations is well given its
size<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.860> its<00:04:55.450> power<00:04:56.450> limit<00:04:56.930> obviously<00:04:57.860> you

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
size and its power limit obviously you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.010 
size and its power limit obviously you
can<00:04:58.190> fit<00:04:58.520> all<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.820> external<00:04:59.240> flashes<00:04:59.780> on<00:04:59.900> to

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
can fit all the external flashes on to

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.330 
can fit all the external flashes on to
your<00:05:00.140> camera<00:05:00.410> which<00:05:00.500> have<00:05:00.680> more<00:05:00.860> power<00:05:01.100> and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
your camera which have more power and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.460 
your camera which have more power and
they<00:05:02.270> also<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:02.750> heads<00:05:03.020> which<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:03.320> can

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
they also have heads which you can

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.430 
they also have heads which you can
rotate<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.040> turn<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.550> can<00:05:04.700> bounce<00:05:04.880> light<00:05:05.440> and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
rotate and turn you can bounce light and

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.170 
rotate and turn you can bounce light and
then<00:05:06.950> you<00:05:06.980> can<00:05:07.190> go<00:05:07.220> nuts<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.790> you<00:05:07.880> can<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.060> it's

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
then you can go nuts and you can go it's

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.600 
then you can go nuts and you can go it's
off<00:05:08.360> camera<00:05:08.630> lighting<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.770> now<00:05:10.400> for

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
off camera lighting and now for

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.580 
off camera lighting and now for
off-camera<00:05:10.970> lighting<00:05:11.030> stuff<00:05:11.540> i<00:05:11.840> will

off-camera lighting stuff i will

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.660 
off-camera lighting stuff i will

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
probably cover a little bit of it for

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.210 
probably cover a little bit of it for
the<00:05:16.820> 500<00:05:17.330> d<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.720> but<00:05:18.530> really<00:05:18.920> i'm<00:05:19.010> going<00:05:19.160> to
