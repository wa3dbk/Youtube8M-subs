00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
much better that he would have that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
much better that he would have that
advantage<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.409> happened<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.890> those

five<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> six<00:02:02.579> years<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.600> know

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
five to six years I think we we all know

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
five to six years I think we we all know
that<00:02:03.750> both<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.320> fighters<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.009> they

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that both of the fighters you know they

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
that both of the fighters you know they
gotten<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.579> bit<00:02:05.790> older<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
gotten a little bit older and with that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.150 
gotten a little bit older and with that
they've<00:02:06.960> lost<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.680> there's<00:02:07.890> been<00:02:08.009> some

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they've lost you know there's been some

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.650 
they've lost you know there's been some
slippage<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.700> sort<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.970> their<00:02:09.119> strengths<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
slippage and sort of their strengths and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
slippage and sort of their strengths and
where<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.200> stand<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.250> money<00:02:11.280> right

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
where they stand but for my money right

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.710 
where they stand but for my money right
now<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:11.910> Mayweather

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
now I think Mayweather

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840 
now I think Mayweather
which<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.020> more<00:02:13.290> physically<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.100> fight<00:02:14.340> are

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
which is more physically this fight are

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.610 
which is more physically this fight are
related<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> promotion<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.350> sort

related to the promotion and that sort

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.840 
related to the promotion and that sort
of<00:02:16.680> surprising<00:02:17.070> given<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.460> we're<00:02:17.700> now

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
of surprising given that we're now

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.610 
of surprising given that we're now
getting<00:02:18.330> pretty<00:02:18.690> close<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.080> fight<00:02:19.320> yeah

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620

this is for you has a better shot now
than<00:02:33.000> he<00:02:33.090> would<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.300> five<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:33.810> six<00:02:33.960> years<00:02:34.020> ago

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
than he would have five or six years ago

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.080 
than he would have five or six years ago
well<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:34.950> he<00:02:35.040> does<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> timing<00:02:35.850> in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
well of what he does with the timing in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.780 
well of what he does with the timing in
the<00:02:36.120> speed<00:02:36.510> has<00:02:36.900> slipped<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.770> bit<00:02:38.010> or<00:02:38.430> many

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the speed has slipped just a bit or many

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.210 
the speed has slipped just a bit or many
the<00:02:39.030> slippage<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.630> me<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.930> more<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.860> way<00:02:41.010> he

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
the slippage to me is more of the way he

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.070 
the slippage to me is more of the way he
sets<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:42.060> we're<00:02:42.240> fighting<00:02:42.480> looks<00:02:42.810> at<00:02:42.960> it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
sets up if we're fighting looks at it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480 
sets up if we're fighting looks at it
than<00:02:43.290> necessarily<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.950> physically<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.460> I

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
than necessarily the physically and I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.220 
than necessarily the physically and I
think<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> transition<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.110> his

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
think it's more of a transition of his

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.840 
think it's more of a transition of his
mindset<00:02:46.620> he's<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.310> hurricane

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
mindset he's not that hurricane

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.250 
mindset he's not that hurricane
offensive<00:02:48.480> fighter<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.840> came<00:02:48.990> into<00:02:49.170> your

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
in the fight right now than he ever

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.500 
in the fight right now than he ever

would have had and I think that's going
to<00:03:51.570> be<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> key<00:03:52.019> because<00:03:52.440> I've<00:03:52.560> said<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> lot<00:03:52.920> of

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
to be the key because I've said a lot of

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.280 
to be the key because I've said a lot of
times<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:53.850> seen<00:03:54.180> Floyd<00:03:54.450> faced<00:03:55.170> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
times when have we seen Floyd faced a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.960 
times when have we seen Floyd faced a
guy<00:03:55.410> with<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> how<00:03:55.890> many<00:03:56.070> their<00:03:56.340> primes<00:03:56.640> has

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
guy with the how many their primes has

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.210 
guy with the how many their primes has
eroded<00:03:57.299> at<00:03:57.570> least<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.900> little<00:03:58.049> bit<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.010> at

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
eroded at least a little bit and so at

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.830 
eroded at least a little bit and so at
the<00:03:59.340> highest<00:03:59.580> level<00:04:00.030> if<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.269> erodes<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.750> a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the highest level if it erodes just a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.900 
the highest level if it erodes just a
little<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.830> may<00:04:02.010> force<00:04:02.070> them<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.580> stand

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
little bit that may force them to stand

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.940 
little bit that may force them to stand
closer<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.750> little<00:04:04.019> bit<00:04:04.290> longer<00:04:04.500> than<00:04:04.860> maybe

was ridiculous and and Pacquiao's
offense<00:04:09.120> was<00:04:09.500> unbelievable<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.650> we<00:04:10.799> just

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.890 
offense was unbelievable but we just
need<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.549> little<00:04:11.640> bit<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:11.880> erosion<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.480> might

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
need a little bit of erosion it might

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.570 
need a little bit of erosion it might
lend<00:04:13.080> itself<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.500> more<00:04:13.739> fan-friendly<00:04:14.010> fight<00:04:14.549> I

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
lend itself to more fan-friendly fight I

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.610 
lend itself to more fan-friendly fight I
also<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.510> now<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:15.989> were<00:04:16.260> five<00:04:16.470> or

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
also think that now that were five or

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.770 
also think that now that were five or
six<00:04:16.799> years<00:04:16.859> down<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.700> line<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.150> their

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
six years down the line and their

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.990 
six years down the line and their
legacies<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.560> more<00:04:19.979> clearly<00:04:20.340> established

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
legacies are more clearly established

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.550 
legacies are more clearly established
now<00:04:21.150> than<00:04:21.359> they<00:04:21.450> were<00:04:21.479> five<00:04:21.900> or<00:04:22.080> six<00:04:22.229> years<00:04:22.289> ago

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
now than they were five or six years ago

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.740 
now than they were five or six years ago
it<00:04:23.010> becomes<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.669> much<00:04:23.729> more<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.360> big<00:04:24.539> fight

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it becomes that much more of a big fight

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.210 
it becomes that much more of a big fight
in<00:04:24.960> each<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.289> Republicans

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
in each of Republicans

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.110 
in each of Republicans
all<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> different<00:04:26.640> things<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.910> they're

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
all the different things that they're

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.670 
all the different things that they're
being<00:04:27.240> asked<00:04:27.540> about<00:04:27.570> interviews<00:04:28.050> but<00:04:28.500> make

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
being asked about interviews but make

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.980 
being asked about interviews but make
absolutely<00:04:29.130> no<00:04:29.220> mistake<00:04:29.640> this<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.780> legacy

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
absolutely no mistake this is the legacy

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.170 
absolutely no mistake this is the legacy
fight<00:04:31.440> period<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.220> they<00:04:32.610> know<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.090> they

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
fight period and they know it and they

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.000 
fight period and they know it and they
have<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.810> desire<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.200> win<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.650> more<00:04:34.830> than

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
have the desire to win it more than

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.410 
have the desire to win it more than
probably<00:04:35.310> any<00:04:35.550> other<00:04:35.640> fight<00:04:36.030> they've<00:04:36.210> ever

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
probably any other fight they've ever

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.240 
probably any other fight they've ever
been<00:04:36.630> associated<00:04:36.900> with<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.800> think<00:04:38.040> that's

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
been associated with and I think that's

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.100 
been associated with and I think that's
going<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.520> mean<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:38.910> come<00:04:39.450> fight<00:04:39.690> night<00:04:39.720> they

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
going to mean that come fight night they

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.930 
going to mean that come fight night they
will<00:04:40.290> have<00:04:40.410> no<00:04:40.590> choice<00:04:40.860> but<00:04:40.920> they<00:04:41.640> will<00:04:41.760> have

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
will have no choice but they will have

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.400 
will have no choice but they will have
to<00:04:42.090> let<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.240> all<00:04:42.420> hang<00:04:42.660> out<00:04:42.810> if<00:04:43.020> they<00:04:43.140> want<00:04:43.350> to

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
to let it all hang out if they want to

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.470 
to let it all hang out if they want to
win<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.860> could<00:04:44.070> produce<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.700> better

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
win and that could produce a better

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.060 
win and that could produce a better
fight<00:04:45.780> than<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.050> think<00:04:46.260> some<00:04:46.440> people<00:04:46.740> think<00:04:46.890> it

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
fight than I think some people think it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.070 
fight than I think some people think it
might<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.610> hope<00:04:47.970> that's<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.300> case<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.810> can't

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
might be I hope that's the case I can't

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.600 
might be I hope that's the case I can't
wait<00:04:49.260> if<00:04:49.440> they<00:04:49.620> if<00:04:49.890> they<00:04:50.100> lay<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.580> line

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
wait if they if they lay it on the line

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.240 
wait if they if they lay it on the line
we<00:04:50.910> could<00:04:51.120> get
