barefooted<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.710> prefer<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> wear<00:01:32.430> them

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
barefooted I just prefer to wear them

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.590 
barefooted I just prefer to wear them
with<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> sock<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:34.200> feet<00:01:34.409> sweat<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.600> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
with a sock because my feet sweat and I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
with a sock because my feet sweat and I
need<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> absorb<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> sweat<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
need something to absorb the sweat and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.289 
need something to absorb the sweat and
so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> wear<00:01:40.530> socks<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> they're<00:01:42.150> pretty

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so I wear socks and they're pretty

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
so I wear socks and they're pretty
comfortable<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.680> believe<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> probably

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
comfortable I believe it probably

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
comfortable I believe it probably
reduces<00:01:45.149> any<00:01:45.930> friction<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
reduces any friction if I got that I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
reduces any friction if I got that I
don't<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:48.299> shoes<00:01:48.570> fit<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:49.110> snug

more fat walking you guys got any

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.800 
more fat walking you guys got any
feedback<00:04:01.280> on<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.699> I'm<00:04:02.359> going<00:04:02.479> to<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.659> some

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
feedback on that I'm going to do some

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.599 
feedback on that I'm going to do some
research<00:04:02.959> on<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.349> but<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:03.769> just<00:04:03.919> I<00:04:04.099> saw

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
research on that but it's just I saw

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.339 
research on that but it's just I saw
something<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.030> said<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.810> could<00:04:05.959> burn<00:04:06.169> it

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
something that said you could burn it

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.309 
something that said you could burn it
even<00:04:06.650> as<00:04:06.799> much<00:04:07.159> fat<00:04:07.549> walking<00:04:08.239> as<00:04:08.419> you<00:04:09.169> do

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
even as much fat walking as you do

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.949 
even as much fat walking as you do
running<00:04:09.650> or<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.209> burn<00:04:11.359> more<00:04:11.659> fat

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
running or that you burn more fat

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.929 
running or that you burn more fat
because<00:04:12.199> when<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.620> walk<00:04:13.159> is<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.639> slow

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
because when you walk is like a slow

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.029 
because when you walk is like a slow
burn<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.449> you're<00:04:14.540> using<00:04:14.750> fat<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.500> when<00:04:15.919> you

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
burn and you're using fat and when you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.550 
burn and you're using fat and when you
run<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.459> you're<00:04:16.789> losing<00:04:17.150> using<00:04:17.840> more

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
run you you're losing using more

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.719 
run you you're losing using more
glycogen<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.209> I'll<00:04:21.169> research<00:04:21.739> that<00:04:21.950> out<00:04:22.130> but

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
glycogen so I'll research that out but

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.910 
glycogen so I'll research that out but
