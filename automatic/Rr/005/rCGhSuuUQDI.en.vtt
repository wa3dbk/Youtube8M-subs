00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.110
 this time it is not a fan package but 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.839
 a manufacturer has sent me something 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.430
 cube energy are just starting to look new 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.410
 to appear on the market 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 and they do not let themselves be lumped 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 just a complete palette out 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 So that's what I think is real, of course 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 I'll say that time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.050

 philosophy behind the product well that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 Of course it is clear that they think 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 They all have to get involved 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.439
 a bit off the ground but what 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.689

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.049
 directly to new varieties 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.619
 but you do not see what that is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.100
 could 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.580

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.410
