00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
been working on this really lame project

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.380 
been working on this really lame project
it's<00:00:16.440> actually<00:00:16.710> yeah<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> wouldn't<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.060> if

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it's actually yeah I wouldn't know if

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
it's actually yeah I wouldn't know if
I'd<00:00:18.539> call<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.810> lame<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.859> anyway<00:00:20.100> so

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
I'd call it lame or not but anyway so

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.670 
I'd call it lame or not but anyway so
this<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:22.369> it<00:00:23.369> works<00:00:24.260> with<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> game<00:00:25.500> key

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this thing it works with a game key

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.550 
this thing it works with a game key
right<00:00:26.180> well<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.390> decided<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.869> make<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> GameCube

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
right well I decided to make a GameCube

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
right well I decided to make a GameCube
a<00:00:28.619> little<00:00:28.830> cooler<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.260> an<00:00:31.529> LED

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
a little cooler and to make it an LED

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.180 
a little cooler and to make it an LED
cue<00:00:32.149> but<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.530> how<00:00:34.530> many<00:00:34.680> games<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
cue but you know how many games can you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.400 
cue but you know how many games can you
play<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.399> 15<00:00:35.850> LED<00:00:36.180> cue<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> button

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
play with 15 LED cue it's got a button

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.690 
play with 15 LED cue it's got a button
though<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.950> pretty<00:00:38.160> sweet

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
though that's pretty sweet

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.979 
though that's pretty sweet
but<00:00:39.210> still<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> cool<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
but still like it's not that cool and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
but still like it's not that cool and
it's<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> wires<00:00:43.770> underneath<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it's got a lot of wires underneath it so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's got a lot of wires underneath it so
I<00:00:45.629> decided<00:00:46.559> wire<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.180> snakes<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
I decided wire is kind of like snakes so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
I decided wire is kind of like snakes so
why<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> snake<00:00:50.820> game<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.809> not

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
why don't make a snake game that's not

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
why don't make a snake game that's not
true<00:00:52.230> actually<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.739> made<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.160> right

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
true actually I just made that up right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.560 
true actually I just made that up right
now<00:00:53.430> anyway

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
now anyway

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
now anyway

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
let me show you how the snake game works

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
let me show you how the snake game works
it's<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.539> fascinating<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.930> what

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
happens is you've got this cube of LEDs

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.789 
happens is you've got this cube of LEDs
how<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:09.119> too<00:01:09.299> bad

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
button and the game starts you see I've

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
button and the game starts you see I've
got<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.520> snake<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.990> there

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
to get that foot I don't know well it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
to get that foot I don't know well it
just<00:01:25.200> moved<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.710> let's<00:01:26.220> play<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
just moved so let's play this game and

triple snake or something and let's see

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:51.190 
triple snake or something and let's see
if<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:48.829> I've<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.000> this

if I can get more I've got what is this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
if I can get more I've got what is this
this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.409> five<00:01:53.689> yeah<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> bet<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> never

what's technology coming to these days I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.310 
what's technology coming to these days I
know<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.990> crazy<00:02:01.290> stuff<00:02:01.619> oh<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> missed<00:02:02.759> it
