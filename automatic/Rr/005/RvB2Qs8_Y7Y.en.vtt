another<00:01:30.250> mega<00:01:30.520> man<00:01:30.730> I<00:01:30.909> think<00:01:31.630> people<00:01:31.900> would<00:01:31.990> be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
another mega man I think people would be

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.420 
another mega man I think people would be
pretty<00:01:32.380> darn<00:01:32.500> happy<00:01:32.650> so<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:32.980> think<00:01:33.190> that'd<00:01:33.280> be<00:01:33.400> a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
pretty darn happy so I think that'd be a

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.310 
pretty darn happy so I think that'd be a
good<00:01:33.490> idea<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.480> any<00:01:34.630> ip's<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.140> you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
good idea but is there any ip's that you

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.080
