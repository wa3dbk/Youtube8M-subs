I<00:01:14.259> think<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:15.380> position<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.009> rather

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
I think this position is rather

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.200 
I think this position is rather
beautiful<00:01:16.399> because<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.600> showing<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.259> many

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
beautiful because it is showing you many

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.870 
beautiful because it is showing you many
geometrical<00:01:20.210> patterns<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:22.100> curiosity

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
geometrical patterns and the curiosity

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.139 
geometrical patterns and the curiosity
of<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.390> consists<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.619> fits<00:01:25.159> then<00:01:25.520> actually

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
of it consists that fits then actually

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.899 
of it consists that fits then actually
doesn't<00:01:26.539> see<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.110> move<00:01:27.319> oki<00:01:28.009> one<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:28.429> I<00:01:28.610> think

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
doesn't see the move oki one and I think

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.600 
doesn't see the move oki one and I think
that<00:01:29.179> in<00:01:29.869> our<00:01:30.049> silicon<00:01:30.740> error<00:01:31.069> this<00:01:31.189> is

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
that in our silicon error this is

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.779 
that in our silicon error this is
actually<00:01:32.329> very<00:01:32.360> funny<00:01:33.219> this<00:01:34.219> position

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
actually very funny this position

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.169 
actually very funny this position
actually<00:01:35.299> illustrates<00:01:36.229> very<00:01:36.380> well<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:37.179> very

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179
