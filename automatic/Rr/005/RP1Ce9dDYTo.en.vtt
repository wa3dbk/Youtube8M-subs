00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that I use for cycling hiking as well

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.130 
that I use for cycling hiking as well
and<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:24.000> dog<00:00:24.230> Tyson<00:00:25.230> he's<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.279> old

whenever<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.559> track<00:01:04.799> hey<00:01:05.689> this<00:01:06.689> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
whenever we get to the track hey this is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
whenever we get to the track hey this is
my<00:01:06.930> friend<00:01:07.140> Cheney<00:01:07.619> today's<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.310> my

my friend Cheney today's gonna be my

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.440 
my friend Cheney today's gonna be my
first<00:01:08.970> day<00:01:09.720> ever<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.229> try<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.950> run<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
first day ever gonna try and run so a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
first day ever gonna try and run so a
minimum<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> mile<00:01:14.070> here's<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
minimum I want to do a mile here's the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
minimum I want to do a mile here's the
brace<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.110> carbon<00:01:16.560> fiber<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.189> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
brace and this is carbon fiber and it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.600 
brace and this is carbon fiber and it's
made<00:01:17.520> by<00:01:17.700> kinetic<00:01:18.500> research<00:01:19.500> they've<00:01:20.340> never

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
made by kinetic research they've never

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
made by kinetic research they've never
had<00:01:20.850> an<00:01:20.909> athlete<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.630> far<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.110> I've<00:01:22.259> been<00:01:22.290> told

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
had an athlete as far as I've been told

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830 
had an athlete as far as I've been told
use<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.220> brace<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> new

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
use their brace so and this is a new

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
use their brace so and this is a new
design<00:01:25.320> carbon<00:01:26.189> fiber<00:01:26.400> goes<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> way

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
design carbon fiber goes all the way

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
design carbon fiber goes all the way
down<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.080> carbon<00:01:28.439> fiber<00:01:28.619> plate

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
down and then the carbon fiber plate

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
down and then the carbon fiber plate
comes<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.520> way<00:01:29.700> across<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
comes all the way across so now I have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.399 
comes all the way across so now I have
the<00:01:31.860> ability<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> push<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.810> toes<00:01:34.079> which

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the ability to push from my toes which

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.840 
the ability to push from my toes which
is<00:01:34.560> weird<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.860> me<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
is weird for me because I'm actually you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.870 
is weird for me because I'm actually you
still<00:01:36.060> walking<00:01:36.320> like<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.619> dragging<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.700> now

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
still walking like this dragging but now

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.899 
still walking like this dragging but now
I<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> ability<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.110> push<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.759> have

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I get the ability to push off but I have

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.780 
I get the ability to push off but I have
to<00:01:42.540> learn<00:01:42.810> how<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.549> don't

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to learn how to do that i don't i don't

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.139 
to learn how to do that i don't i don't
know<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.320> problem<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
know how is the problem so this will be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
know how is the problem so this will be
really<00:01:48.540> exciting<00:01:49.079> oh<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.829> there's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really exciting oh and then there's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.289 
really exciting oh and then there's
carbon<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> front<00:01:50.790> oh<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.119> one's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
carbon right in the front oh this one's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.859 
carbon right in the front oh this one's
cool<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.100> my<00:01:53.100> muscles<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.820> growing<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
cool so my muscles will be growing the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.240 
cool so my muscles will be growing the
my<00:01:54.990> cafes<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.770> muscle

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
my cafes you can see I have muscle

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.670 
my cafes you can see I have muscle
atrophy<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.390> measured<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.439> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
atrophy and I measured this this is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.170 
atrophy and I measured this this is
eight<00:01:58.920> inches<00:01:59.750> in<00:02:00.750> diameter<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.340> as<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.759> muscle

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
eight inches in diameter so as my muscle

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.340 
eight inches in diameter so as my muscle
Bros<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.939> carbon<00:02:05.939> fiber<00:02:06.119> plate<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.750> be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Bros this carbon fiber plate can be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.130 
Bros this carbon fiber plate can be
and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.340> adjust<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.569> muscles<00:02:09.959> stars

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and then adjust it as my muscles stars

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then adjust it as my muscles stars
