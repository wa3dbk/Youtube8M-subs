the big flat flat face ones and i

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
the big flat flat face ones and i
thought<00:00:52.020> else<00:00:52.199> racing<00:00:52.440> um<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.730 
homework i'm setting them up on my own
wood<00:01:19.500> um<00:01:20.100> here's<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.700> g<00:01:20.850> 60<00:01:21.150> s<00:01:21.210> 4<00:01:21.299> 32g<00:01:21.630> 7<00:01:21.869> z's<00:01:22.290> no

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
wood um here's my g 60 s 4 32g 7 z's no

bungee<00:01:23.100> seven<00:01:23.340> seas<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.850> full

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bungee seven seas are a little bit full

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
bungee seven seas are a little bit full
like<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.479> their<00:01:24.930> closer<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.830> basically

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like they have their closer so basically

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
like they have their closer so basically
difference<00:01:26.490> between<00:01:26.670> 376<00:01:27.270> izinski<00:01:27.450> seven

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
difference between 376 izinski seven

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
difference between 376 izinski seven
times<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.619> no<00:01:28.710> backing<00:01:28.890> intro<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
times a back like no backing intro so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859 
times a back like no backing intro so
barring<00:01:29.579> rubbing<00:01:29.850> against<00:01:30.060> rock<00:01:30.390> metal<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
barring rubbing against rock metal so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
barring rubbing against rock metal so
there's<00:01:31.079> less<00:01:31.140> friction<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> stuff<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there's less friction and stuff so it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
there's less friction and stuff so it
gives<00:01:32.670> an<00:01:32.790> overall<00:01:33.030> better<00:01:33.150> performance<00:01:33.600> now

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
gives an overall better performance now

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
gives an overall better performance now
for<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.439> reason<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.740> van<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.450> even

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
for some reason this van just not even

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100 
for some reason this van just not even
coming<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> i<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.810> these<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.960> gonna<00:01:40.020> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
coming on so i think these are gonna be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
coming on so i think these are gonna be
really<00:01:40.259> sick<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.560> set<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> cool
