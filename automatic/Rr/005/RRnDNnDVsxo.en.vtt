we're<00:00:01.640> in<00:00:01.820> a<00:00:01.910> crown<00:00:02.450> molding<00:00:02.900> project<00:00:03.290> um<00:00:04.870> I

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
we're in a crown molding project um I

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.509 
we're in a crown molding project um I
decided<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.499> make<00:00:06.620> a<00:00:06.649> little<00:00:06.829> video<00:00:07.069> of<00:00:07.339> this

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
decided to make a little video of this

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.259 
decided to make a little video of this
one<00:00:07.759> and<00:00:07.970> teach<00:00:08.509> smashes<00:00:09.379> I<00:00:09.849> mean<00:00:10.849> I<00:00:10.940> can<00:00:11.120> teach

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
one and teach smashes I mean I can teach

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.850 
one and teach smashes I mean I can teach
about<00:00:11.599> it<00:00:11.780> which<00:00:12.019> is<00:00:12.049> sometimes<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.830> little

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
about it which is sometimes a little

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.320 
about it which is sometimes a little
hard<00:00:13.040> because<00:00:13.219> it<00:00:13.429> demands<00:00:13.700> practice<00:00:14.150> but

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
hard because it demands practice but

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.820 
hard because it demands practice but
there<00:00:14.929> are<00:00:14.990> some<00:00:15.110> principle<00:00:15.559> that<00:00:15.620> you<00:00:15.709> need

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
there are some principle that you need

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.760 
there are some principle that you need
to<00:00:15.950> understand<00:00:16.370> crown<00:00:17.240> molding<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:18.260> mold<00:00:18.620> in

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
to understand crown molding is a mold in

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.880 
to understand crown molding is a mold in
the<00:00:18.890> goes<00:00:20.020> against<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.170> wall<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:21.680> the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
the goes against the wall and the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.920 
the goes against the wall and the
ceiling<00:00:21.920> at<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.340> same<00:00:22.580> time<00:00:22.790> so<00:00:23.540> the<00:00:23.660> crown

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
ceiling at the same time so the crown

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.550 
ceiling at the same time so the crown
molding<00:00:24.610> crumbled<00:00:25.610> in<00:00:25.790> to<00:00:26.000> make<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.180> look

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
molding crumbled in to make a look

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440 
molding crumbled in to make a look
fairly<00:00:27.560> nice

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
fairly nice

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.820 
fairly nice
you<00:00:29.450> have<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.810> follow<00:00:30.020> some<00:00:30.500> sort<00:00:30.680> of

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
you have to follow some sort of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.250 
you have to follow some sort of
techniques<00:00:31.520> that<00:00:31.970> through<00:00:32.240> all<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.630> time<00:00:32.900> you

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
techniques that through all the time you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.220 
techniques that through all the time you
know<00:00:33.380> some<00:00:33.560> people<00:00:33.740> have<00:00:34.670> been<00:00:35.230> perfectioning

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
know some people have been perfectioning

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.810 
know some people have been perfectioning
with<00:00:36.560> different<00:00:37.130> tools<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.610> there<00:00:37.730> are

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
with different tools and there are

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.640 
with different tools and there are
different<00:00:38.210> methods<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.840> actually<00:00:39.350> doing

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
different methods of actually doing

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.940 
different methods of actually doing
another<00:00:40.250> tissue<00:00:40.490> one<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.090> them<00:00:41.270> which<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.950> with

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
another tissue one of them which is with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.040 
another tissue one of them which is with
straight<00:00:43.430> cuts<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.090> know<00:00:44.120> some<00:00:44.420> people<00:00:44.750> will

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
straight cuts you know some people will

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.590 
straight cuts you know some people will
do<00:00:45.380> something<00:00:45.650> that's<00:00:45.980> called<00:00:46.250> copying<00:00:46.820> which

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
do something that's called copying which

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.040 
do something that's called copying which
are<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.350> know<00:00:48.500> cuts<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.370> then<00:00:49.880> are<00:00:50.570> followed

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
are you know cuts that then are followed

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.830 
are you know cuts that then are followed
with<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.320> contouring<00:00:52.220> salt<00:00:53.180> which<00:00:53.450> is<00:00:53.600> called

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
with a contouring salt which is called

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.720 
with a contouring salt which is called
as<00:00:53.930> cutting<00:00:54.290> so<00:00:54.620> I'm<00:00:54.800> gonna<00:00:55.070> do<00:00:55.250> that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
as cutting so I'm gonna do that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.370 
as cutting so I'm gonna do that
you<00:00:56.060> can<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.480> one<00:00:56.660> as<00:00:56.780> well<00:00:56.810> it's<00:00:57.200> not<00:00:57.260> a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
you can do that one as well it's not a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.410 
you can do that one as well it's not a
problem<00:00:57.530> sometimes<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.370> when<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:58.700> when

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
problem sometimes it is when you when

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.380 
problem sometimes it is when you when
you<00:00:59.480> have<00:00:59.660> some<00:00:59.809> natural<00:01:00.399> finish<00:01:01.399> or<00:01:01.700> what<00:01:02.270> you

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you have some natural finish or what you

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.649 
you have some natural finish or what you
want<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.809> paint<00:01:03.260> your<00:01:03.649> build<00:01:04.519> your<00:01:04.819> mold<00:01:05.030> your

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
want to paint your build your mold your

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.459 
want to paint your build your mold your
crown<00:01:05.840> mold<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:06.200> now<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:07.159> are<00:01:07.280> some<00:01:08.469> basics

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
crown mold it now here are some basics

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.389 
crown mold it now here are some basics
the<00:01:09.889> first<00:01:10.159> one<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:11.979> no<00:01:12.979> matter<00:01:13.159> what

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
the first one is that no matter what

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.709 
the first one is that no matter what
type<00:01:13.579> of<00:01:13.609> crumble<00:01:14.149> you're<00:01:14.329> going<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.539> put<00:01:14.630> you

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
type of crumble you're going to put you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.080 
type of crumble you're going to put you
have<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.990> determine<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:15.649> is<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.429> height<00:01:16.789> of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
have to determine what is the height of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.449 
have to determine what is the height of
the<00:01:17.420> crown<00:01:17.659> molding<00:01:18.049> against<00:01:18.499> the<00:01:19.189> ceiling

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
the crown molding against the ceiling

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.419 
the crown molding against the ceiling
and<00:01:19.810> then<00:01:20.810> I'm<00:01:20.929> going<00:01:21.079> to<00:01:21.139> tell<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.409> why<00:01:21.619> if

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
and then I'm going to tell you why if

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.569 
and then I'm going to tell you why if
you<00:01:22.520> notice<00:01:22.819> if<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.899> press<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.100> mold<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.429> this

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
you notice if I press the mold in this

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.940 
you notice if I press the mold in this
is<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.759> fun<00:01:25.939> part<00:01:26.079> if<00:01:27.079> I<00:01:27.229> press<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.499> hold<00:01:27.799> it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
is the fun part if I press and hold it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.669 
is the fun part if I press and hold it
it's<00:01:28.939> going<00:01:29.149> to<00:01:29.209> determine<00:01:29.420> what<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.529> the

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
it's going to determine what is the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.489 
it's going to determine what is the
height<00:01:30.889> so<00:01:31.399> I<00:01:31.429> mean<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:31.999> can<00:01:32.179> do<00:01:32.479> either<00:01:32.689> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
height so I mean you can do either the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.609 
height so I mean you can do either the
tin<00:01:33.709> you<00:01:33.859> can<00:01:33.889> actually<00:01:34.130> get<00:01:34.789> out<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:35.469> like<00:01:36.469> in

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
tin you can actually get out on like in

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.739 
tin you can actually get out on like in
this<00:01:36.740> case<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:37.850> make<00:01:37.999> a<00:01:38.029> little<00:01:38.240> line<00:01:38.479> in

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
this case you can make a little line in

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.539 
this case you can make a little line in
the<00:01:38.899> bottom<00:01:39.139> should<00:01:39.859> you<00:01:39.979> make<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.159> little<00:01:40.369> line

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the bottom should you make a little line

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.719 
the bottom should you make a little line
and<00:01:40.819> locate<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.569> wall<00:01:41.779> so<00:01:41.990> from<00:01:42.139> robot<00:01:42.729> so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
and locate this wall so from robot so

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.099 
and locate this wall so from robot so
you<00:01:44.119> put<00:01:44.389> this<00:01:44.539> molding<00:01:45.139> over<00:01:45.289> here<00:01:45.529> right

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
you put this molding over here right

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.919 
you put this molding over here right
then<00:01:48.109> your<00:01:48.259> foot<00:01:48.439> on<00:01:49.119> squared<00:01:50.119> rather<00:01:50.779> the

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
then your foot on squared rather the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.940 
then your foot on squared rather the
other<00:01:51.049> way<00:01:51.729> then<00:01:52.729> remark<00:01:54.939> more<00:01:55.939> like<00:01:56.149> not<00:01:57.020> that

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
other way then remark more like not that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.179 
other way then remark more like not that
line<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.579> line<00:01:58.880> W<00:01:59.569> from<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.079> ceiling<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:01.159> the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
line is a line W from the ceiling to the

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.940 
line is a line W from the ceiling to the
battle<00:02:01.639> in<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.719> family<00:02:03.200> I'm<00:02:03.319> shaking<00:02:03.770> right

now that will give you the idea that you

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.410 
now that will give you the idea that you
need<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.930> go<00:02:30.109> always<00:02:31.010> contain<00:02:31.970> yourself

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
need to go always contain yourself

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.080 
need to go always contain yourself
around<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.959> height<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.220> sometimes<00:02:34.700> what

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
around the height and sometimes what

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.460 
around the height and sometimes what
happens<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.659> when<00:02:35.810> people<00:02:36.109> don't<00:02:36.290> do

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
happens is that when people don't do

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.740 
happens is that when people don't do
that<00:02:36.680> they<00:02:37.340> start<00:02:37.730> working<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.359> then<00:02:38.629> they

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that they start working and then they

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.270 
that they start working and then they
start<00:02:39.019> twisting<00:02:39.500> when<00:02:39.709> they<00:02:39.829> get<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.129> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
start twisting when they get to the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.429 
start twisting when they get to the
corners<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.790> standing<00:02:41.540> there<00:02:41.720> there's<00:02:42.349> a

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
corners and standing there there's a

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.649 
corners and standing there there's a
harder<00:02:42.799> prescription<00:02:43.400> we'll<00:02:44.180> see<00:02:44.329> how<00:02:44.480> they

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
harder prescription we'll see how they

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.710 
harder prescription we'll see how they
do<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.379> I<00:02:45.530> might<00:02:45.739> kind<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.159> lining<00:02:46.459> up

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
do all this I might kind of lining up

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.220 
do all this I might kind of lining up
orders<00:02:47.720> or<00:02:48.500> whatever<00:02:48.889> unless<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.900> long

know<00:03:51.049> will<00:03:51.440> determine

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
know will determine

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.149 
know will determine
yeah<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.400> found<00:03:53.090> some<00:03:53.329> people<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.159> that's

yeah I found some people that that's

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.800 
yeah I found some people that that's
kind<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.400> slappy<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.849> mean<00:03:56.030> looks<00:03:56.269> really<00:03:56.599> bad

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
kind of slappy I mean looks really bad

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.050 
kind of slappy I mean looks really bad
it's<00:03:57.109> hard<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.439> work<00:03:57.590> with<00:03:57.799> anyway<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:58.849> one

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
it's hard to work with anyway this one

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.670 
it's hard to work with anyway this one
is<00:03:59.180> meant<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.419> go<00:03:59.629> that<00:03:59.810> way<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.379> can<00:04:00.560> actually

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
is meant to go that way you can actually

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.740 
is meant to go that way you can actually
check<00:04:01.099> sometimes<00:04:01.370> when<00:04:01.699> you<00:04:01.760> buy<00:04:01.939> it<00:04:02.000> at<00:04:02.689> a

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
check sometimes when you buy it at a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.710 
check sometimes when you buy it at a
store<00:04:02.930> how<00:04:03.769> high<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.180> thing<00:04:05.419> you<00:04:05.689> know

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
store how high is this thing you know

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.270 
store how high is this thing you know
you<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.079> see<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.290> little<00:04:06.439> specifications

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
you can see the little specifications

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.249 
you can see the little specifications
that<00:04:07.489> are<00:04:08.060> there<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:08.870> know<00:04:08.959> on<00:04:09.079> there

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:09.259 
that are there you you know on there

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.229 
that are there you you know on there
schematic<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.859> tell<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.549> how<00:04:10.669> high<00:04:10.879> it<00:04:10.939> is<00:04:11.060> so

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
schematic and tell you how high it is so

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.119 
schematic and tell you how high it is so
you<00:04:11.359> keep<00:04:11.750> remembering<00:04:12.139> you<00:04:12.530> know<00:04:12.709> remember

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
that measurement and take it back home

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.479 
that measurement and take it back home
I'm<00:04:15.739> going<00:04:15.829> to<00:04:15.889> show<00:04:16.009> you<00:04:16.039> in<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.190> moment<00:04:16.310> how

I'm going to show you in a moment how
you<00:04:16.940> can<00:04:17.180> cut<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.849> here<00:04:19.849> we<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.239> on<00:04:20.560> inner

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you can cut so here we have on inner

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.580 
you can cut so here we have on inner
corner<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:23.539> a<00:04:23.570> long<00:04:23.930> piece<00:04:24.380> of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
corner and we have a long piece of

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.180 
corner and we have a long piece of
caramel

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
caramel

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.770 
caramel

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
and I went all the way to the corner

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.810 
and I went all the way to the corner
over<00:04:26.870> there<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.410> it's<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.530> about<00:04:27.740> 14<00:04:28.280> feet<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
over there so it's like about 14 feet I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.010 
over there so it's like about 14 feet I
got<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.810> 16<00:04:30.290> feet<00:04:30.560> long<00:04:30.770> pieces<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.910> he<00:04:32.780> saves

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
got the 16 feet long pieces and he saves

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320 
got the 16 feet long pieces and he saves
you<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.230> lot<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.590> cuts<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.280> when<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.030> get<00:04:35.180> over

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
you a lot of cuts so when you get over

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.480 
you a lot of cuts so when you get over
here<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.600> wanna<00:04:36.200> show<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.650> few<00:04:37.040> little<00:04:37.310> lines

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
here I wanna show you few little lines

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.490 
here I wanna show you few little lines
that<00:04:37.610> are<00:04:37.790> over<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.120> those<00:04:38.810> lines<00:04:39.080> are<00:04:39.320> the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
that are over there those lines are the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.080 
that are over there those lines are the
ones<00:04:39.530> market<00:04:40.160> two<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.720> three<00:04:42.470> sixteenths<00:04:43.090> if

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
ones market two and three sixteenths if

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
ones market two and three sixteenths if
you<00:04:44.450> notice<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.170> mean<00:04:45.410> we<00:04:45.620> don't<00:04:45.950> know<00:04:46.070> we're

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you notice I mean we don't know we're

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.860 
you notice I mean we don't know we're
going<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.670> you<00:04:46.940> know<00:04:46.970> just<00:04:47.270> add<00:04:47.420> up<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.720> little

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
going to you know just add up a little

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.330 
going to you know just add up a little
bit<00:04:48.020> more<00:04:48.170> with<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.350> little<00:04:48.380> shim<00:04:48.770> over<00:04:49.040> here

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
bit more with a little shim over here

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.670 
bit more with a little shim over here
but<00:04:50.150> that's<00:04:50.360> just<00:04:50.600> that's<00:04:50.870> where<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.290> goes<00:04:51.440> I

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
but that's just that's where it goes I

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.050 
but that's just that's where it goes I
mean<00:04:51.800> not<00:04:52.040> all<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.250> corners<00:04:52.700> are<00:04:52.790> going<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.000> be

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
mean not all the corners are going to be

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.910 
mean not all the corners are going to be
fine<00:04:53.270> because<00:04:53.540> remember<00:04:54.050> there<00:04:54.290> is<00:04:54.380> plaster

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
fine because remember there is plaster

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.620 
fine because remember there is plaster
and<00:04:55.100> drywall<00:04:55.580> compound<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.240> all<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.420> stuff

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
and drywall compound and all the stuff

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.840 
and drywall compound and all the stuff
but<00:04:57.410> that's<00:04:57.770> pretty<00:04:57.920> much<00:04:58.040> what<00:04:58.310> happens<00:04:58.700> how

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
but that's pretty much what happens how

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.570 
but that's pretty much what happens how
as<00:04:59.120> as<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.510> as<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.900> go<00:05:00.110> along<00:05:00.430> you're<00:05:01.430> gonna

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
as as you as you go along you're gonna

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.980 
as as you as you go along you're gonna
find<00:05:01.850> our<00:05:02.180> pieces<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.120> mean<00:05:05.390> you

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
find our pieces and that that I mean you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.700 
find our pieces and that that I mean you
know<00:05:06.020> really<00:05:06.620> long<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:08.620> recommend<00:05:09.620> you

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
know really long and I recommend you

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.650 
know really long and I recommend you
always<00:05:09.860> tune<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.550> kind<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.820> fasten<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:11.480> and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
always tune to kind of fasten it up and

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.780 
always tune to kind of fasten it up and
not<00:05:11.810> not<00:05:12.290> not<00:05:12.590> all<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.040> way<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.400> corners

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
not not not all the way to the corners

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.480 
not not not all the way to the corners
because<00:05:14.740> sometimes<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.860> corners<00:05:16.250> are<00:05:16.460> a

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
because sometimes the corners are a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.190 
because sometimes the corners are a
little<00:05:16.730> tricky<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.240> work<00:05:17.390> with<00:05:17.450> so<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:17.990> want

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
little tricky to work with so you want

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.110 
little tricky to work with so you want
to<00:05:18.290> have<00:05:18.470> them<00:05:18.620> if<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.340> notice<00:05:19.670> you<00:05:19.880> know<00:05:19.970> like

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
to have them if you notice you know like

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.690 
to have them if you notice you know like
I<00:05:20.150> already<00:05:20.330> put<00:05:20.690> some<00:05:21.160> some<00:05:22.160> caulking<00:05:22.400> over

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
I already put some some caulking over

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.080 
I already put some some caulking over
there

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
there

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.630 
there
but<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.750> didn't<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.260> didn't<00:05:24.530> finish<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.920> up<00:05:25.040> all

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
but I didn't I didn't finish it up all

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.460 
but I didn't I didn't finish it up all
the<00:05:25.700> way<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.150> corner<00:05:26.450> so<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.660> can<00:05:26.960> just<00:05:27.290> kind

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
the way to the corner so I can just kind

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.650 
the way to the corner so I can just kind
of<00:05:27.530> play<00:05:28.070> around<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.520> little<00:05:28.670> with<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.090> with<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
of play around a little with it with the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.360 
of play around a little with it with the
mold<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.050> will<00:05:30.200> get<00:05:30.320> up<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:30.650> down<00:05:30.770> until<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.130> get

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
mold it will get up and down until I get

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.060 
mold it will get up and down until I get
that<00:05:31.520> that<00:05:32.120> angle<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.650> know<00:05:33.740> close

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
that that angle that that you know close

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.190 
that that angle that that you know close
that<00:05:34.280> gap<00:05:34.460> as<00:05:34.790> much<00:05:35.030> as<00:05:35.210> possible<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:36.169> you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
that gap as much as possible so you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.140 
that gap as much as possible so you
don't<00:05:36.290> have<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.710> big<00:05:36.980> you<00:05:37.490> know<00:05:37.520> caulking

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
don't have this big you know caulking

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.760 
don't have this big you know caulking
lines<00:05:38.360> or<00:05:38.540> whatever<00:05:38.780> so<00:05:39.320> that's<00:05:39.470> pretty<00:05:39.620> much

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
lines or whatever so that's pretty much

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.940 
lines or whatever so that's pretty much
the<00:05:39.950> principle<00:05:40.430> how<00:05:40.640> you<00:05:40.700> do<00:05:40.910> okay<00:05:41.770> here<00:05:42.770> is

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
the principle how you do okay here is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.610 
the principle how you do okay here is
the<00:05:43.100> miter<00:05:43.700> saw<00:05:44.000> this<00:05:44.870> is<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.350> or<00:05:45.530> the

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
lighting lasers whatever but I'm not

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.909 
lighting lasers whatever but I'm not
going<00:06:02.450> to<00:06:02.480> go<00:06:02.600> through<00:06:02.780> that<00:06:02.930> stuff<00:06:03.200> I'm<00:06:03.770> gonna

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
going to go through that stuff I'm gonna

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.740 
going to go through that stuff I'm gonna
go<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.100> to<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.970> what<00:06:05.210> we're<00:06:05.360> doing<00:06:05.390> right<00:06:05.690> now

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
go to to to what we're doing right now

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.200 
go to to to what we're doing right now
so<00:06:06.320> what<00:06:07.100> happens<00:06:07.430> is<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.580> once<00:06:07.910> you<00:06:08.030> know

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
so what happens is that once you know

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.930 
so what happens is that once you know
that<00:06:08.240> let's<00:06:08.840> say<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:08.990> have<00:06:09.230> two<00:06:10.070> inches<00:06:10.550> in

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
that let's say you have two inches in

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.730 
that let's say you have two inches in
3/16<00:06:11.630> of<00:06:11.690> an<00:06:11.780> inch<00:06:12.010> and<00:06:13.010> 3/16<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.640> an<00:06:13.730> e<00:06:13.820> um<00:06:14.740> do

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
3/16 of an inch and 3/16 of an e um do

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.800 
3/16 of an inch and 3/16 of an e um do
you<00:06:15.919> take<00:06:16.100> it<00:06:16.250> back<00:06:16.400> to<00:06:16.610> to<00:06:17.000> upside-down<00:06:17.419> you

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
you take it back to to upside-down you

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.390 
you take it back to to upside-down you
take<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:18.080> back<00:06:18.200> to<00:06:18.350> your<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.860> your<00:06:18.890> to<00:06:19.370> your

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
take it back to your to your to your

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.159 
take it back to your to your to your
miter<00:06:19.730> saw<00:06:19.970> whatever<00:06:20.240> small<00:06:20.660> deep<00:06:20.870> whatever

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
miter saw whatever small deep whatever

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.700 
miter saw whatever small deep whatever
and<00:06:21.410> then<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.980> use<00:06:22.130> you<00:06:22.730> know<00:06:22.880> mark

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
and then you use you know mark

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.270 
and then you use you know mark
and<00:06:25.360> place<00:06:26.360> it<00:06:26.570> you<00:06:27.500> know<00:06:27.620> Trey's<00:06:27.919> a<00:06:27.949> little

and place it you know Trey's a little

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.360 
and place it you know Trey's a little
line<00:06:28.460> and<00:06:29.169> you<00:06:30.169> know<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.500> always<00:06:30.979> whenever

line and you know that always whenever
you're<00:06:31.520> gonna<00:06:31.639> cut<00:06:31.970> this<00:06:32.120> molding<00:06:32.509> upside

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
you're gonna cut this molding upside

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.159 
you're gonna cut this molding upside
down<00:06:33.020> oh<00:06:33.289> you're<00:06:34.160> gonna<00:06:34.250> have<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.990> line

down oh you're gonna have that line

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:37.390 
down oh you're gonna have that line
you're<00:06:36.350> going<00:06:36.470> to<00:06:36.530> be<00:06:36.620> respecting<00:06:37.190> that<00:06:37.220> I

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
you're going to be respecting that I
