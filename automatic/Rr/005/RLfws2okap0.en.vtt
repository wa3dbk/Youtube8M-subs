he hasn't got good heading so you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
he hasn't got good heading so you
wouldn't<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.890> he'd<00:01:02.129> make<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.730> good

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
wouldn't think he'd make a very good

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.050 
wouldn't think he'd make a very good
target<00:01:03.390> man<00:01:04.070> first<00:01:05.070> couple<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> clips<00:01:05.820> you'll

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
target man first couple of clips you'll

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
target man first couple of clips you'll
see<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> he's<00:01:06.720> quite<00:01:07.049> strong<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
see that he's quite strong and this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.830 
see that he's quite strong and this
means<00:01:08.549> he<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.820> drug<00:01:09.060> after<00:01:09.210> finders<00:01:09.630> pretty

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
means he get drug after finders pretty

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
means he get drug after finders pretty
easily<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.340> means<00:01:11.670> he's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
easily and it also actually means he's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
easily and it also actually means he's
pretty<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> air<00:01:12.950> compared<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> with

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pretty good in the air compared to with

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
pretty good in the air compared to with
74<00:01:14.640> headings<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:15.780> went<00:01:16.049> quite

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
74 headings that he actually went quite

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.460 
74 headings that he actually went quite
a<00:01:16.409> lot<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> headers<00:01:18.049> which<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.200> quite

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
a lot of headers which is quite

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.399 
a lot of headers which is quite
surprising<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.939> despite<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.479> he's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
surprising but despite this he's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
surprising but despite this he's
definitely<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> ideal<00:01:23.670> target<00:01:24.150> man

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
definitely not the ideal target man

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.230 
definitely not the ideal target man
because<00:01:24.720> he<00:01:24.869> doesn't<00:01:25.049> win<00:01:25.320> everything<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
because he doesn't win everything and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
because he doesn't win everything and
he's<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.570> tall<00:01:28.369> however<00:01:29.369> his<00:01:29.520> shooting

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
he's not that tall however his shooting

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.740 
he's not that tall however his shooting
is<00:01:30.150> pretty<00:01:30.900> dang<00:01:31.560> good<00:01:32.150> his<00:01:33.150> finished<00:01:33.540> shots

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is pretty dang good his finished shots

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
is pretty dang good his finished shots
are<00:01:33.990> pretty<00:01:34.320> good<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.860> didn't<00:01:35.250> score<00:01:35.460> any

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
are pretty good I didn't score any

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.859 
are pretty good I didn't score any
long-range<00:01:35.790> shot<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.689> mainly

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
long-range shot but that was mainly

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
long-range shot but that was mainly
because<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.350> midfield<00:01:37.770> were<00:01:37.950> taking<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because my midfield were taking out the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.899 
because my midfield were taking out the
long<00:01:38.640> shots<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> he<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.220> has<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> pretty

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
long shots so he actually has a pretty

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.310 
long shots so he actually has a pretty
nice<00:01:42.180> finish<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.840> thing<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> does

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
nice finish on one thing that does

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.039 
nice finish on one thing that does
definitely<00:01:43.560> unbound<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.490> his<00:01:44.729> left<00:01:45.000> foot<00:01:45.240> he

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
definitely unbound is his left foot he

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.980 
definitely unbound is his left foot he
had<00:01:46.170> quite<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> few<00:01:46.500> chances<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.009> his<00:01:47.159> left<00:01:47.490> foot

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
had quite a few chances on his left foot

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
had quite a few chances on his left foot
when<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.200> playing<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.560> him<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.040> he

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
when I was playing with him and he

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
when I was playing with him and he
managed<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> miss<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.049> believe<00:01:52.320> or

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
managed to miss all of them I believe or

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.969 
managed to miss all of them I believe or
at<00:01:53.970> least<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.110> ones<00:01:55.710> weren't

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
at least all of the ones weren't

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.270 
at least all of the ones weren't
tappings<00:01:56.750> yeah<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:58.049> left-footed<00:01:58.619> shots<00:01:58.950> were

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
tappings yeah his left-footed shots were

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.539 
tappings yeah his left-footed shots were
not<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.850> good<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.740> does<00:02:01.950> say<00:02:02.219> he<00:02:02.430> has

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
not very good at all it does say he has

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
not very good at all it does say he has
forced<00:02:03.090> our<00:02:03.240> weak<00:02:03.420> foot<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.590> me

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
forced our weak foot but for me

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
forced our weak foot but for me
definitely<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:05.969> could<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.360> score<00:02:06.689> as<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
definitely not he could not score as a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.499 
definitely not he could not score as a
foot<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.530> his<00:02:08.399> right<00:02:08.700> foot<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.450> said

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
foot at all his right foot as I said

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960 
foot at all his right foot as I said
it's<00:02:09.869> vanessa<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.410> very<00:02:10.709> good<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> sign

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it's vanessa is very good just to sign

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
it's vanessa is very good just to sign
out<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.300> video's<00:02:12.780> when<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.200> sure

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
out on this video's when I'm sure

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.790 
out on this video's when I'm sure
gameplay<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:15.239> not<00:02:15.900> meant<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.590> some

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
gameplay it's not meant to be like some

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.949 
gameplay it's not meant to be like some
kind<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.190> compilation<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.000> goals<00:02:18.270> or<00:02:18.540> anything

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
kind of compilation of goals or anything

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.650 
kind of compilation of goals or anything
I<00:02:19.170> could<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.220> wanted<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.580> score<00:02:21.030> goals<00:02:21.090> with

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I could if I wanted to score goals with

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.880 
I could if I wanted to score goals with
him<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.900> could<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.230> stick<00:02:22.380> them<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> bronze

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
him I could just stick them in a bronze

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
him I could just stick them in a bronze
scene<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.540> show<00:02:24.900> off<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.410> like

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
scene and then just show off and be like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.059 
scene and then just show off and be like
yeah<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.670> guy<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:26.910> amazing<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.980> obviously<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
yeah this guy is amazing but obviously I

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.229 
yeah this guy is amazing but obviously I
don't<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.849> wouldn't<00:02:30.120> be

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
don't do that because that wouldn't be

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.449 
don't do that because that wouldn't be
an<00:02:30.330> accurate<00:02:30.569> review<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.739> players<00:02:32.040> so

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
an accurate review of the players so

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.170 
an accurate review of the players so
that's<00:02:32.730> why<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.239> show<00:02:34.050> mrs.<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:35.030> dribbles<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that's why I show mrs. and dribbles and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.589 
that's why I show mrs. and dribbles and
stuff<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.690> too<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> yeah<00:02:38.610> he<00:02:39.450> was

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
stuff like that too so yeah he was

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.570 
stuff like that too so yeah he was
actually<00:02:39.780> pretty<00:02:40.110> quick<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> agile<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.430> me

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
actually pretty quick and agile for me

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.699 
actually pretty quick and agile for me
and<00:02:41.849> he<00:02:42.480> made<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> lot<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.170> decent<00:02:43.500> triples<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
and he made a lot of decent triples so I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.990 
and he made a lot of decent triples so I
reckon<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.830> guy<00:02:46.980> might<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.340> slightly<00:02:47.700> better

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
reckon this guy might be slightly better

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500 
reckon this guy might be slightly better
in<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.840> two-strike<00:02:49.350> ER<00:02:49.470> formation<00:02:50.100> he<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
in a two-strike ER formation he is a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
in a two-strike ER formation he is a
little<00:02:51.840> slow<00:02:52.170> he<00:02:52.470> feels<00:02:52.709> faster<00:02:53.160> than<00:02:53.340> his

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
little slow he feels faster than his

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.570 
little slow he feels faster than his
stats<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> might<00:02:54.299> want<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.630> quick<00:02:54.959> striker

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
stats but you might want a quick striker

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.699 
stats but you might want a quick striker
beside<00:02:56.580> him<00:02:56.790> although<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.049> do<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.410> fast

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
beside him although if you do put a fast

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.080 
beside him although if you do put a fast
striker<00:02:58.980> beside<00:02:59.340> him<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.549> may<00:02:59.670> not<00:02:59.819> be<00:03:00.060> able

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
striker beside him you may not be able

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.449 
striker beside him you may not be able
to<00:03:00.330> put<00:03:00.510> Shaqiri<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.319> same<00:03:01.500> two<00:03:01.709> who<00:03:01.980> he

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
to put Shaqiri in the same two who he

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.009 
to put Shaqiri in the same two who he
gets<00:03:02.640> full<00:03:02.849> chemistry<00:03:03.299> with<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:03.810> they're

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
gets full chemistry with because they're

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.130 
gets full chemistry with because they're
from<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> same<00:03:04.410> club<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.920> nationality<00:03:06.140> as

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
from the same club and nationality as

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.410 
from the same club and nationality as
for<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.440> league<00:03:07.650> he's<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.250> stuff<00:03:08.819> he's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
for the league he's in and stuff he's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.320 
for the league he's in and stuff he's
probably<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.110> best<00:03:10.290> team<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.970> Swiss

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
probably in the best team in the Swiss

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.520 
probably in the best team in the Swiss
League<00:03:12.799> Swiss<00:03:13.799> Lee<00:03:14.010> isn't<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:15.390> popular<00:03:15.690> it's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
League Swiss Lee isn't that popular it's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.670 
League Swiss Lee isn't that popular it's
not<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.830> badly<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:17.730> Silver's<00:03:18.180> i<00:03:18.420> think<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:18.900> in

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
not a badly for Silver's i think but in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.490 
not a badly for Silver's i think but in
terms<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.070> gold<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.940> somewhat<00:03:21.420> lacking<00:03:21.690> so

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
terms of gold it's somewhat lacking so

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.750 
terms of gold it's somewhat lacking so
if<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.709> want<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> build<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.250> team<00:03:23.400> around<00:03:23.430> him

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
if you want to build a team around him

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.340 
if you want to build a team around him
you<00:03:23.880> probably<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.359> go<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.690> hybrid<00:03:25.140> and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
you probably have to go for a hybrid and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.380 
you probably have to go for a hybrid and
as<00:03:25.950> i<00:03:26.100> said<00:03:26.160> before<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.060> link<00:03:27.239> him

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
as i said before you can just link him

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.360 
as i said before you can just link him
up<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:27.690> Shaqiri<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.530> they<00:03:28.650> will<00:03:28.769> both<00:03:28.920> get<00:03:29.100> 9

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
up with Shaqiri and they will both get 9

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.750 
up with Shaqiri and they will both get 9
chemistry<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.209> pretty<00:03:30.690> much<00:03:30.750> any<00:03:31.109> formation

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
chemistry and pretty much any formation

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080 
chemistry and pretty much any formation
except<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.970> maybe<00:03:33.120> four<00:03:33.569> 4<00:03:33.900> 11<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.549> think<00:03:35.549> so

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
except for maybe four 4 11 I think so

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.610 
except for maybe four 4 11 I think so
yeah<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.329> hope<00:03:36.420> you've<00:03:36.840> enjoyed<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.440> review

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
and i think i'll be bringing out another

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.170 
and i think i'll be bringing out another
one<00:03:40.829> tomorrow<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.299> all<00:03:42.450> talk<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.079> you
