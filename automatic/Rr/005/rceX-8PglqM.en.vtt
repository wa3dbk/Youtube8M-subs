 sweets 29 after eating they wash 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 immediately instinctively to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.270
 although it was always thought that they can not 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.520
 distinguish colors recent studies 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.879
 they showed that they can see red on 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.460
 green and blue 24 as their bodies do not 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.350
 they are hairs are 24 nerve endings 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 grouped four by four that you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 They serve to measure distances and how 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.340
 air detectors 22 both the tricolor 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.570
 like red and white are exclusive to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.460
 the females 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.090
 if you see them in a male, it's something like 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 a genetic anomaly 21 cats believe 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 that are the home owners not the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 humans 20 castration can extend 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.409
 the life of a cat between 2 or 3 years 19 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 cats can not only smell with the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 nose but also with the call 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.040
 jacobson cavity located inside of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.330

 17 different cats relax their stress 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.050
 scratching a vertical object therefore 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 There is nothing better than a good post 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.890

 cats obey more women 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.479
 because they perceive the sharp sounds better 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.580

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.910
 humans in the dark as their 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.640
 easy for a cat to survive a large

 blue are deaf 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.780

 deaf on that side 03 for cats the
