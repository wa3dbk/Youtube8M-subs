00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.770 
today we're making some homemade
applesauce<00:00:06.109> with<00:00:06.529> what<00:00:07.279> are<00:00:07.370> these<00:00:07.780> apples

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
applesauce with what are these apples

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.410 
applesauce with what are these apples
apples<00:00:09.440> lots<00:00:10.280> of<00:00:10.400> apples<00:00:10.639> purchasing<00:00:11.389> a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
apples lots of apples purchasing a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.150 
apples lots of apples purchasing a
variety<00:00:11.929> of<00:00:11.959> apples<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.410> different<00:00:12.770> flavors

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
variety of apples and different flavors

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.769 
variety of apples and different flavors
I<00:00:13.279> think<00:00:13.520> it<00:00:13.760> makes<00:00:13.879> the<00:00:14.029> applesauce<00:00:14.420> a<00:00:14.480> little

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
I think it makes the applesauce a little

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.960 
I think it makes the applesauce a little
more<00:00:14.900> interesting<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.460> don't<00:00:16.640> like<00:00:16.789> do

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
more interesting and I don't like do

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.450 
more interesting and I don't like do
sugar<00:00:17.359> I<00:00:17.689> don't<00:00:18.170> use<00:00:18.350> sugar<00:00:18.619> in<00:00:18.980> my<00:00:19.160> applesauce

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
sugar I don't use sugar in my applesauce

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.150 
sugar I don't use sugar in my applesauce
so<00:00:20.360> it<00:00:20.869> kind<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.170> changes<00:00:21.530> the<00:00:21.590> flavor<00:00:21.830> up<00:00:22.039> a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
so it kind of changes the flavor up a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.130 
so it kind of changes the flavor up a
little<00:00:22.340> bit<00:00:22.550> first<00:00:23.030> thing<00:00:23.570> we're<00:00:23.690> gonna<00:00:23.750> do<00:00:23.990> is
