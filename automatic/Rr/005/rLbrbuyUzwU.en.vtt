00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
few videos on how to install bearings

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.900 
few videos on how to install bearings
but<00:00:06.950> I'm<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.250> make<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> video<00:00:08.580> anyway

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
but I'm going to make a video anyway

just because I kind of wanted to show
off<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> awesome<00:00:10.769> board<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.190> got<00:00:11.969> some<00:00:12.150> sector

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
off this awesome board I got some sector

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.269 
off this awesome board I got some sector
nine<00:00:13.519> there<00:00:14.519> 66<00:00:14.880> millimeter<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.890> DA<00:00:16.890> which

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
nine there 66 millimeter a DA which

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.590 
nine there 66 millimeter a DA which
means<00:00:17.520> are<00:00:17.670> fairly<00:00:18.150> soft<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> same

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
means are fairly soft but at the same

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240 
means are fairly soft but at the same
time<00:00:21.779> they're<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.350> spongy<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.010> where<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
time they're not to spongy to where you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490 
time they're not to spongy to where you
can<00:00:23.400> actually<00:00:23.970> ride<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.260> good

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
can actually ride them to really good

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
can actually ride them to really good
ride<00:00:25.939> smooth<00:00:26.990> I'm<00:00:27.990> also<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> put<00:00:28.500> on

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
ride smooth I'm also going to put on

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.870 
ride smooth I'm also going to put on
some<00:00:28.830> risers<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> do

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
some risers here but I'm going to do

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.770 
some risers here but I'm going to do
that<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> later<00:00:30.269> video<00:00:32.420> right<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.600> got

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
that in a later video right here I got
some<00:00:33.960> bones<00:00:34.950> reds<00:00:36.469> these<00:00:37.469> are<00:00:37.649> super<00:00:38.100> fast

some bones reds these are super fast
they're<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.120> durable<00:00:39.540> they're<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> good

price i would highly recommend them I'm
just<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> should<00:00:43.469> show<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
just going to how you should show you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.400 
just going to how you should show you
how<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> install<00:00:44.460> bearings<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.840> mean<00:00:46.260> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
how to install bearings so I mean it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
how to install bearings so I mean it's
super<00:00:46.800> easy<00:00:46.829> trained<00:00:47.820> monkey<00:00:48.149> could<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
super easy trained monkey could do this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.090 
super easy trained monkey could do this
all<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> grab<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.570> wheel

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
all right so you grab your your wheel

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
all right so you grab your your wheel
and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> take<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> bearing<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and you take the bearing and you got to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
and you take the bearing and you got to
make<00:00:54.270> sure<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.980> especially<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.039> their<00:00:56.160> bones

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
make sure that especially if their bones

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
make sure that especially if their bones
like<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> red<00:00:57.360> side<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.140> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
like this that the red side is up this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.959 
like this that the red side is up this
is<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.719> like<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> rubber<00:01:01.590> sheath<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.760> on

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
is like a like a rubber sheath that's on

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
is like a like a rubber sheath that's on
there<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.780> protects<00:01:04.350> your

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
there that actually protects your

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
there that actually protects your
bearings<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
bearings and you can take this off to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
bearings and you can take this off to
clean<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> when<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:09.060> going

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
clean them so when you when you're going

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.690 
clean them so when you when you're going
to<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> push

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
to put them in and then when you push

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
to put them in and then when you push
you<00:01:11.700> might<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.180> use<00:01:12.299> two<00:01:12.570> hands<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you might want to use two hands that I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.120 
you might want to use two hands that I
can't<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.740> I'm<00:01:13.830> holding<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
can't right now because I'm holding the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
can't right now because I'm holding the
camera<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> basically<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.420> like

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
camera and you basically just take like

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
camera and you basically just take like
both<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.770> thumbs<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.490> push<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
both your thumbs and push them on the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
both your thumbs and push them on the
side<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.759> sure

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
side like this but you got to make sure

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
side like this but you got to make sure
its<00:01:21.030> seat<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.540> sets<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.259> right

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
its seat that sets in there right

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
its seat that sets in there right
because<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> push<00:01:23.280> too<00:01:23.310> hard<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:23.909> side

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
because if you push too hard on one side

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
because if you push too hard on one side
of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.840> bearing<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of the other the bearing will go in like

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
of the other the bearing will go in like
lopsided<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> got<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> dig<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
lopsided then you got to dig it out and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.740 
lopsided then you got to dig it out and
start<00:01:28.170> over<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.729> take<00:01:30.450> both

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
start over again so you just take both

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
start over again so you just take both
thumbs<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> push<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:36.409> in<00:01:37.409> its<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.220> helps

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
thumbs and you push down in its it helps

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.710 
thumbs and you push down in its it helps
if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.390> knee<00:01:39.540> or

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
if you do it like on your knee or

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.850 
if you do it like on your knee or
something<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
something but I'm just going to do it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.130 
something but I'm just going to do it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
like this so you can see it push down in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 
like this so you can see it push down in
and<00:01:43.500> you'll<00:01:43.860> hear<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.310> click<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.820> pop<00:01:45.030> as

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it goes into the wheel I do try to make

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.510 
it goes into the wheel I do try to make
sure<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.030> seated<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.810> there

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
sure it's seated all the way in there

just run your finger on the rim and you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
just run your finger on the rim and you
can<00:01:55.920> feel<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> bearing<00:01:56.880> spin<00:01:57.180> oh<00:01:57.390> look<00:01:57.899> these

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
can feel the bearing spin oh look these

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.420 
can feel the bearing spin oh look these
are<00:01:58.110> still<00:01:58.439> spinning<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> those

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
are still spinning like that those

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
are still spinning like that those
things<00:01:59.640> been<00:01:59.880> forever<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
things been forever and then you do the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.459 
things been forever and then you do the
same<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.790> other<00:02:02.880> side<00:02:03.439> what<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
same thing for the other side what I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.350 
same thing for the other side what I
would<00:02:04.710> recommend<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.340> getting<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.119> old

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
would recommend is getting like an old

would recommend is getting like an old
shirt<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:06.990> something<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.649> you're<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:07.950> strong

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
enough to like push them in all the way

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.020 
enough to like push them in all the way
like<00:02:10.229> an<00:02:10.349> old<00:02:10.500> shirt<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.860> put<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> over<00:02:11.520> the

just<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.230> protect<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.340> take

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
just to protect it and then you can take

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.390 
just to protect it and then you can take

do<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.120> got<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.300> make<00:02:24.420> sure<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.780> it's

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
do that you got to make sure that it's

do that you got to make sure that it's
seated<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.350> there<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.740> way<00:02:25.890> because

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
seated in there the right way because

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.100 
seated in there the right way because
you'll<00:02:26.580> push<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.330> you'll<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.630> lift<00:02:27.960> up

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you'll push and then you'll like lift up

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
you'll push and then you'll like lift up
the<00:02:28.230> shirt<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.620> it'll<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.980> there<00:02:29.100> all

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the shirt and it'll be in there all

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.800 
the shirt and it'll be in there all
screwed<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.450> got<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> make<00:02:30.750> sure

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
screwed up so you just got to make sure

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.410 
screwed up so you just got to make sure
it<00:02:30.990> goes<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> right<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.680> um<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:33.300> then

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it goes in the right way um and then

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.120 
it goes in the right way um and then
once<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.170> all<00:02:34.260> done<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.830> put<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
once you get it all done and you put it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.600 
once you get it all done and you put it
on<00:02:35.250> spin<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.240> before<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.660> put<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.490> see<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
on spin it before you put the see you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.420 
on spin it before you put the see you
can<00:02:38.760> hear<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.740> because<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.890> didn't<00:02:41.130> spin<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
can hear that because I didn't spin it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
can hear that because I didn't spin it
before<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> put<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.080> means<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:43.440> of

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
before I put it on so that means one of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.600 
before I put it on so that means one of
the<00:02:43.590> bearings<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.310> probably

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the bearings in there is probably

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.030 
the bearings in there is probably
lopsided<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.020> got<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> take<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.590> wheel<00:02:46.800> off

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
lopsided so I got to take this wheel off

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.530 
lopsided so I got to take this wheel off
again<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.459> fix<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.360> don't

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
again and fix it because I really don't

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.910 
again and fix it because I really don't
want<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> hear<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> whole<00:02:49.350> time<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> ride

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
want to hear that the whole time I ride

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.460 
want to hear that the whole time I ride
and<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.209> probably<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.990> good<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.410> your

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and it's probably not good for your

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
and it's probably not good for your
bearings<00:02:52.860> at<00:02:52.950> all<00:02:53.660> i'm<00:02:54.660> going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:54.990> another

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
bearings at all i'm going to do another

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.370 
bearings at all i'm going to do another
video<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.590> show<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.770> how<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> put<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.190> risers
