is not too big why does it pop right

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.249 
is not too big why does it pop right
back<00:00:17.090> out<00:00:17.390> because<00:00:17.749> I've<00:00:17.869> got<00:00:18.050> weather

same<00:00:40.190> thing<00:00:40.370> right<00:00:40.520> here<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:41.650> used<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:43.060> drill

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
same thing right here I used a drill

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.600 
same thing right here I used a drill
method<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:48.440> means<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.070> drilled<00:00:49.460> a

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
method that means is that I drilled a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.790 
method that means is that I drilled a
hole<00:00:49.720> see<00:00:50.720> if<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.930> can<00:00:51.020> get<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.200> some<00:00:51.380> better

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
hole see if I can get you some better

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.820 
hole see if I can get you some better
light

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.790 

I<00:00:58.860> drilled<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.310> hole<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.730> back<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.060> here

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.440 

and<00:01:04.670> then<00:01:04.850> fed<00:01:05.150> my<00:01:05.720> wire<00:01:05.960> through<00:01:06.680> here<00:01:06.710> and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
and then fed my wire through here and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.190 
and then fed my wire through here and
back<00:01:08.450> behind<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.670> -<00:01:10.880> insert<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.760> move<00:01:13.970> up

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
back behind the - insert as I move up

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.560 
back behind the - insert as I move up
you<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.039> barely<00:01:16.219> see<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.579> light<00:01:16.759> tube<00:01:17.000> that's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
you can barely see the light tube that's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.209 
you can barely see the light tube that's
going<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.869> happen

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.679 

but<00:01:21.219> still<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:22.149> gap<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.630> minimal

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.709 

again<00:01:27.520> barely<00:01:28.520> push<00:01:28.729> on<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.090> comes<00:01:29.390> right<00:01:29.600> back

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
again barely push on it comes right back

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.230 
again barely push on it comes right back
out<00:01:30.249> there's<00:01:31.249> no<00:01:31.460> light<00:01:31.640> coming<00:01:31.969> out<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
out there's no light coming out of the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.539 
out there's no light coming out of the
end<00:01:32.390> because<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:32.899> have<00:01:33.109> put<00:01:33.439> electrical<00:01:34.340> tape

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
end because I have put electrical tape

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.050 
end because I have put electrical tape
over<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.869> edge<00:01:36.049> of<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.920> light<00:01:37.100> tube<00:01:37.369> right<00:01:37.909> in

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
over the edge of the light tube right in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.940 
over the edge of the light tube right in
here

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
here

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.800 
here
it's<00:01:40.490> very<00:01:40.670> difficult<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.210> see<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:41.570> there's<00:01:41.750> a

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's very difficult to see but there's a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.719 
it's very difficult to see but there's a
little<00:01:41.930> piece<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.290> electrical<00:01:42.770> tape<00:01:42.830> right<00:01:43.550> in

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
little piece of electrical tape right in

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.469 
little piece of electrical tape right in
there<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.950> light<00:01:46.190> tube<00:01:46.430> actually<00:01:46.670> sits<00:01:47.330> on

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
there the light tube actually sits on

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.810 
there the light tube actually sits on
top<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.830> small<00:01:49.159> piece<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.640> weather

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
top of a small piece of weather

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.890 
top of a small piece of weather
stripping<00:01:50.409> probably<00:01:51.409> about

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.600 

that<00:01:54.530> long<00:01:55.930> from<00:01:56.930> right<00:01:57.110> there<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:57.650> nice

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that long from right there to there nice

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.300 
that long from right there to there nice
little<00:01:58.910> piece<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.180> weather<00:01:59.360> stripping<00:02:00.310> just

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
little piece of weather stripping just

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.390 
little piece of weather stripping just
play<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.550> takes<00:02:02.540> time<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.440> get<00:02:03.620> exactly<00:02:04.190> where

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
play it takes time to get exactly where

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.550 
play it takes time to get exactly where
you<00:02:04.520> want<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.690> will<00:02:05.780> eventually<00:02:05.960> end

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you want it but you will eventually end

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.900 
you want it but you will eventually end
up<00:02:06.680> with<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.400> perfect<00:02:07.760> line

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.780 

again<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:13.500> barely<00:02:13.710> tap<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.220> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
again just barely tap on it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.880 
again just barely tap on it
then<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:16.719> goes<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:17.019> back<00:02:17.079> into<00:02:17.409> position

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
then it goes right back into position

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.040 
then it goes right back into position
because<00:02:18.189> of<00:02:18.219> the<00:02:18.340> weather<00:02:18.549> stripping

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
because of the weather stripping

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.170 
because of the weather stripping
and<00:02:20.800> there<00:02:20.980> goes<00:02:21.160> my<00:02:21.870> lights<00:02:23.880> anyway<00:02:24.880> that's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and there goes my lights anyway that's

and there goes my lights anyway that's
how<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> ABL<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> driver<00:02:26.800> side

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
how you do the ABL on the driver side

you guys might want to see actually this
is<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> way<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> goes<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.300> right<00:02:52.450> there

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
is the way that it goes in right there

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.160 
is the way that it goes in right there
so<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> way<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.490> it<00:02:54.580> fits<00:02:54.700> in

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
so that's the way that it fits in

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.060 
so that's the way that it fits in
there's<00:02:56.170> your<00:02:56.350> weather<00:02:56.500> stripping<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
there's your weather stripping on the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.090 
there's your weather stripping on the
back<00:02:57.250> also<00:02:58.230> look<00:02:59.230> how<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.410> shave<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.830> park

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
back also look how I shave this park

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.990 
back also look how I shave this park
down<00:03:00.250> right<00:03:00.460> here<00:03:00.640> see<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.400> part<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.850> did

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
down right here see that this part I did

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570 
down right here see that this part I did
not<00:03:04.120> mess<00:03:04.300> with<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.660> all<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.560> part<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.130> used<00:03:06.460> a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
not mess with it all this part I used a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.290 
not mess with it all this part I used a
dremel<00:03:06.730> tool<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:09.550> shaved<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> all<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.210> way

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.809 

and<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.409> see<00:03:14.530> how<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.890> can<00:03:15.040> see<00:03:15.219> the<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
and you can see how you can see the the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.229 
and you can see how you can see the the
curvature<00:03:16.209> right<00:03:16.329> there<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
curvature right there in the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.890 
curvature right there in the
weatherstripping<00:03:19.239> from<00:03:19.510> that's<00:03:19.629> where<00:03:19.840> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
weatherstripping from that's where the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.449 
weatherstripping from that's where the
light<00:03:20.079> tube<00:03:20.260> sits<00:03:20.499> on<00:03:20.680> top<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:21.040> maybe<00:03:21.219> I<00:03:21.280> use

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
light tube sits on top so maybe I use

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.649 
light tube sits on top so maybe I use
the<00:03:21.579> journal<00:03:21.879> just<00:03:21.969> a<00:03:22.060> little<00:03:22.239> bit<00:03:22.329> too<00:03:22.420> far

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
the journal just a little bit too far

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.809 
the journal just a little bit too far
but<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.799> how<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.040> light<00:03:24.249> tubes<00:03:24.430> gonna<00:03:24.639> sit

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
but that's how the light tubes gonna sit

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.299 
but that's how the light tubes gonna sit
back<00:03:24.969> behind<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.329> okay<00:03:27.180> good<00:03:28.180> luck
