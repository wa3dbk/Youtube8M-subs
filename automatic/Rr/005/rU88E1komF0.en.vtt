00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 under the rubric wow addons that honors us 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.500
 itself is so good after installing 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 as ready for use 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 You can talk or dance directly 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170
 visit or play pvp 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.969
 it starts right away but still exists 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 a few settings and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 tips that I would like to show you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
 yes, as soon as there is always a change 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.800
 folder is according to the game a presses 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 escape goes to interface and then on 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.680
 an ic here there is a dots in general 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.969
 font and exposure in general 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.550
 pretty easy at the first check mark in the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.379
 first box must be in there text 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 Automatically adapts we also leave 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.660
 show cool and spiral you can 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.670
 Test yourself if you like it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.330
 to do that away and a cool 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.700
 use my example here below 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.200
 Accident to death you see, it will not be 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.689
 grayed out so you can see already a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 Timers are off about when I am here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.990
 then show cool and spiral 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 you can see in the background of this 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 play just all this is grayed out and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 over time, the whole changes color 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.960
 again bee clock so now there is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 Graduation effect can me 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 choose alert pulse sparkle or nothing 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.210
 I have it in there then that looks about 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.430
 so if you put it in the middle of the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.960
 displays my cook's screen cook 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 then you have to sign here in the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.159
 symbol come there it is that means 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 that just my two abstaining death 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.439
 is ready again as I said there is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.759
 just a few other options 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.500
 Maturity testing could of course do that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.570
 then see through it yourself 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820
 yes with sales on display tags 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.630
 Let's take 50 smallest text 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.909
 display 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 it is so that some are more just 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 some things if only six 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.549
 have a second cooldown 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 which will be at 30 seconds now 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.170
 that is not set to 30 seconds 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730
 displayed 30 seconds is so everything 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.780
 less than three seconds will not 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.090
 displayed everything 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.760
 has is displayed quite simply smallest 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.470
 duration four tenths of a second we need 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360
 not necessarily what he wants it can 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.450
 have title seconds are each for 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 me personally irrelevant and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.890
 uninteresting smallest to text than 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 minute and second to show as well 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.340
 self- determined up to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.590
 which remaining duration in cool then 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.650
 is displayed in minutes seconds 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.660
 Harvey by default you could do it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.989
 also to two minutes means means 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.160
 everything under two minutes is now 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.269
 with minutes our customers indicated 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.430
 smallest therefore conclusion effects 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.430
 also show the same everything under 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.739
 30 seconds get no graduation 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.340
 Effect everything over 30 seconds gets 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.530
 a yes, then we can pass right now 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.420
 to font font itself too 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 Explicably I can choose there 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.800
 it finds quite a lot of it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.900
 again a font will tell him 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.459
 I like color and size too 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.590
 interesting under an hour at the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.049
 cd is lasting under an hour 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.360
 speak the numbers are white under one 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.220
 minute yellow and when they run out the same 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.620
 speak another ten or five seconds 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.930
 are left over then they are red you can see 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.790
 be also very nice and cheap 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.770
 so let's just let that be 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.470
 have good and perfect 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.520
 font size I use now 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.520
 few cds 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.840
 it is very big that looks 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.450
 very unschick from looked after as I go 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 as simply with the indication after 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.950
 below 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.870
 20 seconds 20 is perfect at the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 font size the classic font 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.720
 contour 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.340
 that means frame signature one 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.569
 I see a black frame here 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.470
 make the font size is better 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.020
 looks around here has a black one 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.110
 You can also make culture thinner 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.400
 or even turn it off I also read 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.030
 it then with music on thin sees that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.970
 pretty good but on 20 and the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.140
 last point above text position you can 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.020
 also choose 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.790
 I really like to be right in the center 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.350
 Middle sees it always very well 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.340
 out and down here with xy you can still 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.210
 change the axes 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.220
 I have before because now some 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.740
 played around we make that easy 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.240
 to zero 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.669
 that means we picked something up there 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.090
 have top top rider button top 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.160
 center 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.620
 then everything down to zero should be down here 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.870
 otherwise you have somehow there 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.070
 Stupid are together and that fits 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.330
 not all that was his big whole 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.780
 already play a little with the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.620
 parents 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.780
 Uses the commentary tells me 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.930
 Bitterness was otherwise possible 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.930
 have fun and have a nice day later
