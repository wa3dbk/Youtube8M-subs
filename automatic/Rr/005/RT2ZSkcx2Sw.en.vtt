the NC ten which is a bit of a shame but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.610 
the NC ten which is a bit of a shame but
then<00:03:39.740> again<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.640> machine<00:03:41.180> doesn't<00:03:42.110> really

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
then again this machine doesn't really

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.160 
then again this machine doesn't really
look<00:03:43.460> like<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:44.180> would<00:03:44.300> get<00:03:44.480> scratched<00:03:44.930> easily

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170

quite<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> good<00:04:31.460> idea<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.880> protect<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
quite a good idea to protect is the

really<00:05:31.310> well<00:05:31.490> laid<00:05:32.480> out<00:05:32.510> I<00:05:32.930> can<00:05:33.260> sort<00:05:33.500> of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
really well laid out I can sort of

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.320 
really well laid out I can sort of
already<00:05:33.740> tell<00:05:34.220> that<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.490> will<00:05:34.610> be<00:05:34.700> quite

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
already tell that it will be quite

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.050 
already tell that it will be quite
comfortable<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:35.870> type<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.820> sort<00:05:38.030> of

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
comfortable to type like to sort of

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.060 
comfortable to type like to sort of
compare<00:05:38.420> it<00:05:38.480> to<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> NC<00:05:39.320> 10<00:05:39.680> which<00:05:39.890> I've

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
compare it to the NC 10 which I've

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.470 
compare it to the NC 10 which I've
gotten<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.580> look<00:05:40.880> at<00:05:41.000> that

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
gotten a look at that

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.290 
gotten a look at that
further<00:05:41.840> videos<00:05:42.200> also<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.490> trackpad<00:05:43.790> just

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
further videos also the trackpad just

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.850 
further videos also the trackpad just
looking<00:05:44.570> at<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:44.840> here<00:05:45.020> actually<00:05:45.470> looks<00:05:45.740> a

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
looking at it here actually looks a

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.000 
looking at it here actually looks a
little<00:05:45.890> bit<00:05:46.190> bigger<00:05:46.780> again<00:05:47.780> we'll<00:05:48.650> have<00:05:48.800> to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
little bit bigger again we'll have to

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.890 
little bit bigger again we'll have to
test<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.340> out<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.760> I'll<00:05:49.880> let<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.210> know<00:05:50.330> what

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
test that out and I'll let you know what

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.490 
test that out and I'll let you know what
I<00:05:50.930> think<00:05:51.050> of<00:05:51.290> that

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
I think of that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.770 
I think of that
just<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.430> compare<00:05:52.910> it<00:05:53.090> I've<00:05:53.240> got<00:05:53.390> an<00:05:53.480> Apple

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
just to compare it I've got an Apple

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020 
just to compare it I've got an Apple
keyboard<00:05:54.140> here<00:05:54.320> from<00:05:54.560> my<00:05:54.710> iMac<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.550> you<00:05:55.820> can

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
keyboard here from my iMac and you can

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.940 
keyboard here from my iMac and you can
see<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.480> keyboard<00:05:56.660> design<00:05:57.170> is<00:05:57.350> very<00:05:57.620> very

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
see the keyboard design is very very

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.400 
see the keyboard design is very very
similar<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.940> sort<00:05:59.150> of<00:05:59.210> space<00:05:59.570> that<00:05:59.810> Lawson's

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
similar the sort of space that Lawson's

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.340 
similar the sort of space that Lawson's
type<00:06:00.830> keyboard<00:06:01.450> which<00:06:02.450> I've<00:06:02.690> really<00:06:02.870> got<00:06:03.080> used

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
type keyboard which I've really got used

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.490 
type keyboard which I've really got used
to<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.710> find<00:06:03.980> very<00:06:04.190> easy<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.640> use<00:06:04.850> so

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
to and find very easy to use so

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.900 
to and find very easy to use so
hopefully<00:06:06.500> this<00:06:06.710> laptop<00:06:06.950> or<00:06:07.490> this<00:06:07.640> netbook

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
hopefully this laptop or this netbook

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.820 
hopefully this laptop or this netbook
will<00:06:08.300> actually<00:06:08.600> be<00:06:08.720> a<00:06:08.750> much<00:06:09.230> much<00:06:09.440> easier<00:06:09.500> to

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
will actually be a much much easier to

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.500 
will actually be a much much easier to
use<00:06:09.980> typing<00:06:10.730> wise<00:06:10.910> if<00:06:11.120> you're<00:06:11.240> going<00:06:11.360> to<00:06:11.420> use

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
use typing wise if you're going to use

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.980 
use typing wise if you're going to use
it<00:06:11.660> for<00:06:11.780> any<00:06:11.900> period<00:06:12.530> of<00:06:12.710> time<00:06:13.450> okay<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:14.510> that

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
it for any period of time okay so that

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.230 
it for any period of time okay so that
was<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.140> unboxing<00:06:15.380> of<00:06:16.040> the<00:06:16.310> NC<00:06:17.300> sorry<00:06:18.020> n3<00:06:18.830> 10
