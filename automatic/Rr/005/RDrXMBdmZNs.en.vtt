00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.960
 I'm mister petit pinto graffiti and I do 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.820
 stars and I started in graffiti to 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.630
 finals of 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.390
 at the end of 2002 2003 with influence 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.500
 of my brother who was a tattooist had 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.710
 many tattoos and low rider magazines 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.619
 of that type of magazines there were many 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.739
 Graffiti items from that era 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.010
 from New York as the company is asked 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.700
 you painted graffiti when I entered the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.800
 high school 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.570
 I started my brother takes me to a store 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.380
 from here the center is called typical 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.090
 he checks me and two soles of lemons 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.450
 then start going out into the streets 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:59.680
 to paint you're basically with friends 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.129
 my neighborhood and my school 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.330
 suddenly active always here goes the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.580
 school true stickers posters and then 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.030
 I really did not have anything I did not know 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 nothing about that issue not to neglect the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.820
 know until I gradually 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.650
 knowing several who were engaged in 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.690
 study 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.050
 and from there I came up as well as the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.270
 idea of ​​painting so many bombs away from me 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.640
 little bit of that and get more ideas a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.360
 little bit more complex and I started with the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.110
 characters and I started painting basically 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.520
 characters because as I say I had 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.190
 influence of my brother who was 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.760
 tattooist and in a tattoo magazine 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.120
 I sold a story about francs and that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.240
 is an American illustrator then of 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.850
 there I really liked his style that was 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.060
 basically illustrations of dolls 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.180
 and well, I started like that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 a little bit and then virtually 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.489
 turn it into a style trying 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.760
 to manage my own characters based 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 of that let's say of his good influence 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.819
 pinto pinto of all illegal illegal pinto 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.920
 Sometimes I get to paint bombs I do not know 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.319
 as a taste that always stayed with me 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.459
 since I started painting taxi bombs 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.280
 illegal is something that stays and I think that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.090
 I will never leave it yes yes a commercial 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.530
 of online engine 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.989
 in 2011 everything started because I started 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.690
 go to exhibitions to show my work 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.510

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.440
 in the center by mister flight that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.440
 because he basically invited me to the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 expressions until a good day in a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.580

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:56.260
 neurotic a good day on my twitter it 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.239

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.000

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.900
 Czech that asked me for my pages and 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.659
 then he invited me to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.540
 expose here with love and diamonds is a 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:17.470
 is to plant the idea of good the question 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.680
 of what is true happiness the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.600
 love and diamonds is that is how to look 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.000
 really what makes you happy and my 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.660
 characters are like victims of their 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.360
 desires and their desires that they have I do not know 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.330
 some seek love others seek money and 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.540
 it's basically the idea of ​​planting and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.430
 sow in the viewer the idea of 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.340
 that they reflect on what is 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.670
 the most important thing if the happiness of 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.210
 love or money 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.280
 or both I would like to continue if I have the 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.740
 opportunity to continue exposing what I'm going 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.910
 to do but what of the street I think 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.570
 what I like the most is like something 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.580
 that is always as it is a very space 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.650
 Open too blank to follow 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.390
 experimenting on the street I think 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.000
 experience a little more in large 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.190
 formats since I paint very little is 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.720
 like that characteristic and I think that 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.790
 all those who have painted with me have been 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.460
 realized that he painted very very very 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.160
 small then I want to experience a 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.040
 little bit more the big format and a little bit 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.290
 more make more posters and a little more 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.700
 of extension that is what I think what 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.190
 only thing that is missing in the only thing that I have not 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.880
