00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.330
 money makes happiness hard to be 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.730
 happy without having money is a question 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.519
 that many people do well 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.920
 attentive guys and girls because the 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.890
 creator of minecraft has talked about 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.600
 of this topic has opened his little heart to 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.480
 through your twitter account and the 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.990
 truth is that it personally gives me 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.270
 a lot of grief seems very sad to me 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.290
 it seems very sad what counts because 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.120
 a person who has right now 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.070
 So much money as can be the 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.450
 look what you had to do to 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.730
 through twitter and how it has been opened 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.220
 towards the whole world and the words that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.030
 he has left he is multimillionaire the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.880
 creator of minecraft marcus sold us 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.400
 minecraft to microsoft got a lot 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.550
 money and right now so look how it 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.850
 find because it says the following 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.160
 affirmed how good he spent the time in 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.260
 ibiza with a handful of friends recently 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.530
 and going partying with famous people capable 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.320
 to do whatever they want and 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.730
 that has never been felt in life 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 so isolated is 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.870
 totally isolated is not with people 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.150
 who really wants to be by far 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.910
 money you have set because you have done 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:21.820
 more things very interesting things for 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:24.130
 example says the following states that the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.420
 problem with getting everything is that you 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.000
 you are left without reasons to follow 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.280
 trying to do things says he tried to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.650
 save the world but that exposes you 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 back to the same kind of imbeciles that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 they made him sell minecraft in his 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.700
 moment you do not feel like doing anything 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.560
 more than when he sold the company one of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.150
 It was their best efforts to ensure 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.580
 that the employees stayed in good 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.440
 place and that now everyone hates him 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.390
 the truth 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.330
 I do not know how you see them guys and 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.530
 girls but the creator of minecraft the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.450
 which the truth is that you could get into 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.850
 make another type of projects another type 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 of things not because one thing that has 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.770
 devastated so much that it has triumphed so much 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.990
 that has come out of your mind in really 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 because it can not flourish otherwise 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.750
 because you can not start creating others 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.090
 games with the same mentality that had 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.220
 at the time of creating minecraft not so 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.460
 simply because he does not feel like 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.190
 nothing he says that when you have everything 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.960
 you do not want to do anything because you do not have 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.380
 illusion for doing nothing to do 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.810
 things 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.720
 I do not know how you see this, you guys and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.940
 girls because surely many will say 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.550
 Of course I would like to have the money that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.880
 have that is what I would like to have and 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.040
 I do not have as good there's that I 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.070
 the truth I believe that there is also 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.260
 put in its place obviously does not give me 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.510
 no grief the truth or be a person 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.730
 what 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.890
 that has so much money to me does not give me 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 I also absolutely no penalty 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.920
 I say one thing this man has money 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 because he has earned it because the idea 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.610
 it was yours the creation was yours and good 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.700
 they have proposed to buy that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.370
 let's say that franchise well then only 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.489
 for him not but good what do you think 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.640
 you the money of happiness or 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.730
 really for a lot of money you have if 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.470
 you are not happy you are not happy 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.959
 Well, you have to give that question to 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.269
 see what each one thinks and hopefully 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.920
 Mr. Marcus night, then, dedicate himself to 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.440
 investigate again to bring us a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.450
 new game not to see if it is again a 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.450
 success as minecraft was
