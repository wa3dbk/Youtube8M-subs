you're gonna have to look on the details
of<00:00:23.490> each<00:00:23.670> projector<00:00:24.359> now<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.590> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
of each projector now I really like this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
of each projector now I really like this
projector<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> cost<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.760> 600<00:00:27.660> pounds

as<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.460> full<00:00:35.670> 3d<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.600> 1080p

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
as well now this is full 3d with 1080p

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.030 
as well now this is full 3d with 1080p
I've<00:00:38.219> also<00:00:38.610> bought<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.510> glasses<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.800> were

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I've also bought some glasses which were

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
I've also bought some glasses which were
generic<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:42.000> China<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.629> they're<00:00:42.840> actually

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
generic from China and they're actually

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
generic from China and they're actually
pretty<00:00:43.379> good<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.149> every<00:00:45.149> now<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:45.510> they

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pretty good but every now and then they

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
pretty good but every now and then they
do<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.530> sync<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.760> see

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
do go out of sync and so you can see

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.380 
do go out of sync and so you can see
both<00:00:48.270> both<00:00:48.899> frames<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> basically<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
both both frames of it basically and to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.619 
both both frames of it basically and to
make<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> 3d<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> next<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
make up the 3d so next we have the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.459 
make up the 3d so next we have the
Pioneer<00:00:56.000> amplifier<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.109> need<00:00:58.320> an

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
Pioneer amplifier now you don't need an

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.770 
Pioneer amplifier now you don't need an
amplifier<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.550> wanted<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> full<00:01:00.270> speaker

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
amplifier but we wanted the full speaker

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.979 
amplifier but we wanted the full speaker
system<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.739> goes<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.430> 5.1<00:01:03.270> surround<00:01:03.570> sound

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
system that goes at 5.1 surround sound

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.149 
system that goes at 5.1 surround sound
now<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> capable<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.290> things<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.560> radio

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
now this is capable of things like radio

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
now this is capable of things like radio
tuner<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.090> has<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.830> multi<00:01:10.830> HDMI<00:01:11.430> inputs<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:13.380> also

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

thing<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.960> remember<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> say<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
thing to remember is that say if you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
thing to remember is that say if you
want<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> switch<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.719> input<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.649> way<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> do

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
want to switch your input the way to do

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
want to switch your input the way to do
it<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.579> switch<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.210> your<00:02:06.450> amplifier<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
it is to switch on your amplifier and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050 
it is to switch on your amplifier and
change<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> input<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.489> instead<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
change the input there instead of

room because it was my living room in
the<00:03:24.570> first<00:03:24.720> place<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.140> we<00:03:25.230> didn't<00:03:25.380> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the first place and we didn't really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
the first place and we didn't really
want<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.799> spend<00:03:25.920> much<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.700> anyway<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
want to spend much on it anyway now the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.800 
want to spend much on it anyway now the
way<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.709> cured<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.340> light<00:03:29.760> proofing<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.630> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
way we cured the light proofing is that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.069 
way we cured the light proofing is that
we<00:03:30.930> bought<00:03:31.109> these<00:03:31.350> blackout<00:03:31.890> blinds<00:03:32.160> which

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
we bought these blackout blinds which

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.970 
we bought these blackout blinds which
which<00:03:34.079> cost<00:03:34.320> me<00:03:34.470> about<00:03:35.160> 30<00:03:35.519> 40<00:03:35.880> quid<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:36.980> we

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
which cost me about 30 40 quid now we

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.039 
which cost me about 30 40 quid now we
wanted<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.760> get<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> suede<00:03:39.299> ones<00:03:39.630> with<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
wanted to get the suede ones with the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.470 
wanted to get the suede ones with the
chrome<00:03:40.410> railings<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.250> overall<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> think<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
chrome railings and overall I think the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.060 
chrome railings and overall I think the
finish<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.049> looks<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.410> lot<00:03:43.650> lot<00:03:43.859> better

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
finish of that looks a lot lot better

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.009 
finish of that looks a lot lot better
than<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:45.150> ones<00:03:45.299> without<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.660> chrome

than and the ones without the chrome
railings<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.100> them<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.880> suede<00:03:48.209> finish<00:03:48.570> also

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
railings on them the suede finish also

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.380 
railings on them the suede finish also
gives<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.230> nice<00:03:49.440> touch<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.430> makes<00:03:51.209> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
blinds before and they were they

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.360 
blinds before and they were they
basically<00:04:12.510> let<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:12.989> as<00:04:13.170> much<00:04:13.200> light<00:04:13.410> as<00:04:13.980> as

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
basically let in as much light as as

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.900 
basically let in as much light as as
possible<00:04:15.120> basically<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:17.250> these<00:04:17.459> blackout

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
possible basically and on these blackout

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.170 
possible basically and on these blackout
blinds<00:04:18.150> block<00:04:18.660> out<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.700> 99%<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> light

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
blinds block out like 99% of the light

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.839 
blinds block out like 99% of the light
and<00:04:21.450> therefore<00:04:22.049> say<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> daytime<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.700> can

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
and therefore say in the daytime you can

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.000 
and therefore say in the daytime you can
still<00:04:24.060> watch<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.539> projector<00:04:25.080> without<00:04:25.800> any

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
still watch you projector without any

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.879 
still watch you projector without any
problems

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889

the amp now if you wanted to minimize
the<00:04:42.099> number<00:04:42.219> of<00:04:42.370> remotes<00:04:42.759> you<00:04:43.090> can<00:04:43.330> get<00:04:43.479> an

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
the number of remotes you can get an

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.689 
the number of remotes you can get an
all-in-one<00:04:43.960> remote<00:04:44.110> however<00:04:44.710> they<00:04:45.009> do<00:04:45.069> they

all-in-one remote however they do they
are<00:04:45.729> quite<00:04:46.389> costly<00:04:46.689> they<00:04:47.259> do<00:04:47.560> range<00:04:47.889> from

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
are quite costly they do range from

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.929 
are quite costly they do range from
about<00:04:48.250> 100<00:04:48.759> pounds<00:04:48.939> upwards<00:04:49.689> so<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:51.370> didn't

well I've had no issues with it at all
the<00:05:23.469> postage<00:05:24.180> came<00:05:25.180> pretty<00:05:25.689> quick<00:05:25.900> actually

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
the postage came pretty quick actually

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.339 
the postage came pretty quick actually
and<00:05:26.590> fully<00:05:27.550> for<00:05:28.150> what<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.449> get<00:05:28.689> I<00:05:28.900> really

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
and fully for what you get I really

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.990 
and fully for what you get I really
think<00:05:29.560> it's<00:05:29.800> really<00:05:30.189> worth<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:30.669> get<00:05:30.909> an

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
think it's really worth it to get an

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.089 
think it's really worth it to get an
electric<00:05:31.389> screen<00:05:31.719> because<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.830> get<00:05:33.009> the

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
electric screen because you get the

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.719 
electric screen because you get the
remote<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.909> can<00:05:34.060> lift<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:34.479> up<00:05:34.569> and<00:05:34.750> down

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
remote and you can lift it up and down

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.269 
remote and you can lift it up and down
but<00:05:36.729> um<00:05:37.020> there<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:38.139> have<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:38.379> guys<00:05:38.529> so<00:05:38.889> things

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 
but um there we have it guys so things

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.249 
but um there we have it guys so things
to<00:05:39.490> think<00:05:39.669> about<00:05:39.759> when<00:05:40.150> you're<00:05:40.509> installing

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
to think about when you're installing

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.040 
to think about when you're installing
your<00:05:41.800> own<00:05:42.009> home<00:05:42.310> cinema<00:05:42.729> is<00:05:42.940> firstly<00:05:43.509> the

your own home cinema is firstly the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.019 
your own home cinema is firstly the
screen<00:05:44.409> size<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:45.129> want<00:05:45.279> you're<00:05:45.909> gonna

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
will be a link in the description how to

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.700 
will be a link in the description how to
do<00:05:50.889> this<00:05:51.099> oh<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:52.389> then<00:05:52.779> the<00:05:52.960> next<00:05:53.229> thing<00:05:53.409> is<00:05:53.680> to

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
do this oh and then the next thing is to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.779 
do this oh and then the next thing is to
decide<00:05:54.159> how<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:55.889> basically<00:05:56.889> mount<00:05:57.279> everything

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789

projectors for the projector I bought

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.879 
projectors for the projector I bought
some<00:06:02.620> chains<00:06:02.949> to<00:06:03.250> hang<00:06:03.460> up<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:04.439> the<00:06:05.439> screen

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
some chains to hang up the the screen

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.879 
some chains to hang up the the screen
itself<00:06:06.460> now<00:06:07.120> make<00:06:07.629> sure<00:06:07.659> you<00:06:08.379> drill<00:06:08.680> these

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
itself now make sure you drill these

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.189 
itself now make sure you drill these
into<00:06:09.339> a<00:06:09.370> beam<00:06:09.699> because<00:06:10.089> that'll<00:06:10.689> keep<00:06:10.839> it<00:06:11.050> up
