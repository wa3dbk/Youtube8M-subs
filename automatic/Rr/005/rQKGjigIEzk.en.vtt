00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 electric cars 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 gradually cease to be considered exotic 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 and firmly in everyday life 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.809
 another model from this segment 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.360
 became volvo v60 plug-in hybrid 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 This is the first hybrid car from the Swedes. 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
 officially presented and in Russia not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 a trained person may not understand 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 that in front of him is a super tech model 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 Filling all hybrid cars in 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.929
 Russia is not very widely represented. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 most famous toyota prius and lexus 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.149
 rx450h the main difference between this wagon 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
 from others is that in his power 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.160
 installation used diesel 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.530
 engine with all its advantages 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 two-liter 215 strong engine lead 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 in motion the front wheels and the rear 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 doctor 70 strong electric motor 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.430
 feeding on located in the depths 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 the trunk of the battery their weight by the way 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 say reach an impressive 130 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.940
 kilograms the most interesting is that these 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.280
 batteries can be recharged from household 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 power supply through the front 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 driver's door connector 4 hours

 charging and your car is ready 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 overcome 50 kilometers only on 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 electrical most citizens of this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.380
 will be enough to get from home 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.290
 to work and back depending on 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 traffic conditions and the mood of the driver 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.270
 has the ability to choose one of the three 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.479
 driving modes in all-electric 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.759
 puree machine rides without engaging the engine 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.369
 on the power volvo button turns into 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 a real supercar able to change 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 100 kilometers per hour in 6 seconds 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.450
 still in this case both engines 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 work to its fullest by itself 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.340
 high profitability in this case speech 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.829
 and there is no middle ground 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.040
 hybrid mode fuel consumption of only 2 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.950
 liter is the most interesting feeling when 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.470
 electric motion absolute 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.320
 silence is quite easy almost 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.079
 the elusive hum of a tire rustling noticeably 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 louder heavy batteries 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.549
 placed low which is beneficial 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 affected the ride quality 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.729
 reworked under accounting vase 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.539
 the same mass is equal to the amplifier settings 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.910
 steering wheel 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.060
 Swede turns are surprisingly 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.760
 stable with the advent of volvo v60 plug-in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.810
 hybrid opinion on hybrid machines 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.070
 of course it's changing now it's not only 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.830
 environmental friendliness and economy but also 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.090
 sports adrenaline and character me
