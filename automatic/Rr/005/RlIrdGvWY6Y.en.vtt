they have do having chickens all over
the<00:02:28.500> country<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.890> hopefully<00:02:29.220> those<00:02:29.790> things<00:02:29.970> are

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the country I hopefully those things are

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020 
the country I hopefully those things are
delicious<00:02:31.220> anyway<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.790> all<00:02:32.909> their

delicious anyway so you can do all their
stuff<00:02:33.180> too<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.870> get<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> stick<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
stuff too like you get like a stick and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.520 
stuff too like you get like a stick and
then<00:02:35.340> throw<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.870> don't<00:02:37.349> know

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
then throw in there like I don't know

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.559 
then throw in there like I don't know
like<00:02:37.819> something<00:02:38.819> appropriate<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.629> penis

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
like something appropriate like penis

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.830 
like something appropriate like penis
and<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> also<00:02:44.159> do<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.730> said<00:02:45.510> make

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and so I like to also do I said make

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.399 
and so I like to also do I said make
this<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.110> lowercase<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.549> put<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.260> like

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
this a lowercase and then put a so like

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.970 
this a lowercase and then put a so like
a<00:02:49.620> penis

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
a penis

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.559 
a penis
so<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> think<00:02:51.610> it's<00:02:51.819> more<00:02:51.940> funny<00:02:52.209> when<00:02:52.450> it's

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
so I think it's more funny when it's

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.650 
so I think it's more funny when it's
like<00:02:52.750> using<00:02:53.110> penis<00:02:53.620> rather<00:02:53.950> than<00:02:54.390> using<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
like using penis rather than using a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.509 
like using penis rather than using a
penis<00:02:56.050> or<00:02:56.200> like<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.560> use<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.890> penis<00:02:57.190> rather

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
penis or like you can use a penis rather

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.890 
penis or like you can use a penis rather
than<00:02:57.700> just<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.000> regular<00:02:58.120> penis<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.660> don't<00:02:58.840> know

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.570 
than just a regular penis I don't know
it's<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.650> why<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.860> mean<00:03:00.099> it's<00:03:00.370> so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
