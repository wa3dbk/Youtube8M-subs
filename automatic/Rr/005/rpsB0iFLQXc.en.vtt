that's going to be because the loop
section<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.689> dynamic<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:41.129> can<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> lot

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
section is very dynamic you can do a lot

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.660 
section is very dynamic you can do a lot
more<00:02:41.639> in<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:41.969> software<00:02:42.389> in<00:02:42.950> contracture<00:02:43.950> they

kontrol<00:02:55.109> s4<00:02:55.519> okay<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.879> let's<00:02:57.060> talk<00:02:57.209> about

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
kontrol s4 okay so let's talk about

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.569 
kontrol s4 okay so let's talk about
scratching<00:02:58.049> if<00:02:58.169> your<00:02:58.290> turntable<00:02:58.950> lists<00:02:59.159> it's

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
scratching if your turntable lists it's

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.520 
scratching if your turntable lists it's
very<00:02:59.760> important<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.389> you<00:03:00.599> something<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.439> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
very important to you something that you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.289 
very important to you something that you
want<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.859> be<00:03:01.919> able<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.189> do<00:03:02.340> transitioning<00:03:03.120> from

want to be able to do transitioning from

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.289 
want to be able to do transitioning from
decks<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.049> mixer<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.590> controller<00:03:05.220> now<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
decks and a mixer to a controller now I

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.990 
decks and a mixer to a controller now I
can<00:03:06.720> do<00:03:06.810> scratching<00:03:07.409> on<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.650> denim<00:03:08.280> DMC<00:03:08.819> six

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
can do scratching on the denim DMC six

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.490 
can do scratching on the denim DMC six
thousand<00:03:09.629> that's<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> be<00:03:10.200> kind<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.409> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
thousand that's going to be kind of a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440 
thousand that's going to be kind of a
smaller<00:03:10.829> jog<00:03:11.159> wheel<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:12.090> still<00:03:12.299> very

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
smaller jog wheel it's still very

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.149 
smaller jog wheel it's still very
effective<00:03:12.599> because<00:03:13.169> it's<00:03:13.500> touch<00:03:13.709> sensitivity

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
effective because it's touch sensitivity

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.119 
effective because it's touch sensitivity
on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.150> kontrol<00:03:15.510> s4<00:03:15.719> a<00:03:16.349> little<00:03:16.829> bit<00:03:16.919> bigger

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
on the kontrol s4 a little bit bigger

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.319 
on the kontrol s4 a little bit bigger
that<00:03:17.909> has<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> very<00:03:18.510> very<00:03:18.780> accurate<00:03:19.549> feel<00:03:20.549> when

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that has a very very accurate feel when

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.589 
that has a very very accurate feel when
it<00:03:21.419> comes<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:21.750> doing<00:03:21.900> any<00:03:22.109> kind<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.519> scratching

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
it comes to doing any kind of scratching

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.909 
it comes to doing any kind of scratching
now<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.659> biggest<00:03:25.109> jog<00:03:25.379> wheel<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.859> be

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
now the biggest jog wheel is going to be

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.809 
now the biggest jog wheel is going to be
on<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.129> Pioneer<00:03:26.549> DDJ<00:03:26.700> t1<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:28.579> really<00:03:29.579> really

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
on the Pioneer DDJ t1 and really really

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
on the Pioneer DDJ t1 and really really
nice<00:03:30.000> sometimes<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.109> need<00:03:31.229> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.379> bit

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
nice now the jog wheels on the DB gt1

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.899 
nice now the jog wheels on the DB gt1
also<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:40.049> rotating<00:03:40.650> LED<00:03:41.159> you're
