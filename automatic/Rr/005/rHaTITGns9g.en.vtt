00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
icons up I notice that when I go through

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.580 
icons up I notice that when I go through
my<00:00:52.649> XM<00:00:53.219> such<00:00:53.489> stations<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.379> will

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
my XM such stations it actually will

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
my XM such stations it actually will
scroll<00:00:55.890> through<00:00:55.949> every<00:00:56.730> possible<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
scroll through every possible it's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.860 
scroll through every possible it's a
channel<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> XM<00:01:00.149> sessions<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
channel that is in the XM sessions and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
channel that is in the XM sessions and
so<00:01:01.530> maybe<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> scroll<00:01:02.789> through

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so maybe I don't want to scroll through

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.350 
so maybe I don't want to scroll through
all<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> those<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
all of those maybe I just want to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.640 
all of those maybe I just want to
customize<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.200> listening

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
customize that to what my listening

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
Stern maybe not something I would be

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.630 
Stern maybe not something I would be
willing<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.320> okay<00:01:52.320> there's<00:01:53.040> politics

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
willing to go with okay there's politics

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
willing to go with okay there's politics
there's<00:01:54.090> news<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> there's<00:01:54.689> radio<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.409> then

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
there's news and there's radio and then

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.499 
there's news and there's radio and then
you<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.579> traffic<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.600> everything<00:01:58.250> now

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
you have your traffic and everything now

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.819 
you have your traffic and everything now
depending<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.110> favorites<00:02:01.590> are

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
depending on what your favorites are

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.980 
depending on what your favorites are
would<00:02:02.520> dictate<00:02:02.759> obviously<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.869> would

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
would dictate obviously what you would

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950 
would dictate obviously what you would
choose<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.850> your<00:02:06.299> customized

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
choose to be and in your customized

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
choose to be and in your customized
radio<00:02:07.920> settings<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> matter<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
radio settings so it's just a matter of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.070 
radio settings so it's just a matter of
preference<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> would<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.270> maybe<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
preference and what I would do maybe I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.650 
preference and what I would do maybe I
don't<00:02:13.170> have

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660
