of what we have another contents of this
video<00:00:46.100> will<00:00:46.340> likely<00:00:46.550> change<00:00:47.060> as<00:00:47.660> he<00:00:48.290> said<00:00:48.530> he's

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
planning on taking Zelda Wii U in many

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.130 
planning on taking Zelda Wii U in many
different<00:00:52.070> directions<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:52.820> you'd<00:00:53.540> expect<00:00:54.020> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
different directions so you'd expect the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.110 
different directions so you'd expect the
controls<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:54.740> change<00:00:54.770> but<00:00:55.730> I<00:00:55.760> thought<00:00:55.970> it's

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
controls to change but I thought it's

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.790 
controls to change but I thought it's
still<00:00:56.330> I<00:00:56.570> thought<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:57.560> still<00:00:57.680> an

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
still I thought it's still an

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.010 
still I thought it's still an
interesting<00:00:58.190> thing<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.610> cover<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.600> here<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.840> go

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
interesting thing to cover so here we go

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.350 
interesting thing to cover so here we go
I've<00:01:00.230> studied<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.310> gameplay<00:01:01.730> feature<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.300> I

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
I've studied the gameplay feature and I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.329 
I've studied the gameplay feature and I
believe<00:01:02.630> I've<00:01:02.810> successfully<00:01:03.200> mapped<00:01:03.710> all<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
believe I've successfully mapped all the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.490 
believe I've successfully mapped all the

pile<00:01:26.960> if<00:01:27.109> you<00:01:27.289> have<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.679> in<00:01:28.219> Majora's<00:01:28.939> Mask<00:01:29.119> 3d

this<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.310> bit<00:01:31.460> harder<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:33.530> what

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
this is a little bit harder to know what

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.450 
this is a little bit harder to know what
button<00:01:34.159> he<00:01:34.490> uses<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:36.170> possibly<00:01:36.619> X<00:01:36.950> that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
button he uses but it's possibly X that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.489 
button he uses but it's possibly X that
he<00:01:37.579> uses<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.939> zoom<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.689> or<00:01:38.869> use<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> telescope

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
he uses to zoom in or use the telescope

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.469 
he uses to zoom in or use the telescope
or<00:01:39.829> whatever<00:01:40.069> it<00:01:40.219> is<00:01:40.340> where<00:01:40.549> we<00:01:40.700> see<00:01:40.909> link<00:01:41.210> on

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
or whatever it is where we see link on

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.859

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
the cliff zoom in place a way point at a

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.910 
the cliff zoom in place a way point at a
certain<00:01:45.520> fire<00:01:46.520> off<00:01:46.670> location<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.530> think<00:01:48.530> this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
certain fire off location I think this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.209 
certain fire off location I think this
may<00:01:49.340> be<00:01:49.369> X<00:01:50.139> although<00:01:51.139> it's<00:01:51.289> not<00:01:51.439> clear<00:01:51.889> as<00:01:52.130> he

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
may be X although it's not clear as he

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.190 
may be X although it's not clear as he
holds<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.520> gamepad<00:01:52.880> towards<00:01:53.329> him<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.659> then

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
holds the gamepad towards him and then

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.450 
holds the gamepad towards him and then
it's<00:01:54.469> obvious<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.009> can<00:01:55.159> use<00:01:55.310> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's obvious that you can use the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.309 
it's obvious that you can use the
gyroscope<00:01:56.090> although<00:01:56.389> probably<00:01:57.079> you'll<00:01:57.229> be

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
gyroscope although probably you'll be

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.230 
gyroscope although probably you'll be
able<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.530> use<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.679> control<00:01:58.009> stick<00:01:58.189> as<00:01:58.310> well<00:01:58.340> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
able to use a control stick as well to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.219 
able to use a control stick as well to
control<00:02:00.139> what<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:00.619> see<00:02:01.539> Zed<00:02:02.539> targeting<00:02:03.139> is

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
control what you see Zed targeting is

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.639 
control what you see Zed targeting is
back<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:03.639> obviously<00:02:04.639> Z<00:02:05.569> L<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.139> the<00:02:06.259> button<00:02:06.439> he

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
back and obviously Z L is the button he

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.279 
back and obviously Z L is the button he
uses<00:02:07.009> as<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.429> see<00:02:07.609> here<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:08.929> seems<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.200> a

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
uses as you can see here it seems like a

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.840 
uses as you can see here it seems like a
comfortable<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.009> predictable<00:02:10.459> place<00:02:10.640> for

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
comfortable and predictable place for

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.250 
comfortable and predictable place for
this<00:02:10.970> there's<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.300> much<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.810> say<00:02:11.959> about<00:02:12.050> this

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
this there's not much to say about this

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.570 
this there's not much to say about this

go<00:06:15.520> faster<00:06:15.940> a<00:06:16.090> is<00:06:16.360> probably<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:17.199> the<00:06:17.889> interact

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
go faster a is probably the the interact

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.159 
go faster a is probably the the interact
button<00:06:18.789> like<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.150> has<00:06:19.270> been<00:06:19.479> in<00:06:19.599> most<00:06:19.780> Zelda

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169

game<00:06:20.289> so<00:06:20.410> this<00:06:20.500> will<00:06:20.650> probably<00:06:20.740> do<00:06:21.010> lots<00:06:21.760> and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
game so this will probably do lots and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.580 
game so this will probably do lots and
lots<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.150> different<00:06:22.449> things<00:06:22.630> like<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.440> he'll

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
lots of different things like and he'll

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.700

change<00:06:23.889> with<00:06:24.190> what<00:06:24.430> you're<00:06:24.669> around<00:06:25.570> so<00:06:26.050> it's

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
change with what you're around so it's

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.950 
change with what you're around so it's
likely<00:06:26.949> that<00:06:27.160> since<00:06:28.030> well<00:06:28.510> it<00:06:28.630> is<00:06:28.750> it's

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
likely that since well it is it's
