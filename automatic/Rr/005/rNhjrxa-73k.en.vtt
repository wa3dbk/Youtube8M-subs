Android version 4.1 dot one and let me
zoom<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:47.640> bit<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> says<00:02:51.750> welcome

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
zoom in a little bit and it says welcome

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
zoom in a little bit and it says welcome

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
states of this continue with that and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.770 
states of this continue with that and
right<00:02:58.440> away<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:59.040> shows<00:02:59.670> me<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> Wi-Fi<00:03:00.390> network

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
right away it shows me the Wi-Fi network

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960 
right away it shows me the Wi-Fi network
so<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.080> am<00:03:01.290> assuming<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:02.130> use<00:03:02.760> this

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so I am assuming that you use this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
so I am assuming that you use this
tablet<00:03:03.270> we<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:04.080> enter<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.440> Wi-Fi<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.070> let

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
tablet we have to enter the Wi-Fi so let

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.870 
tablet we have to enter the Wi-Fi so let
me<00:03:05.370> add<00:03:05.489> my<00:03:05.670> Wi-Fi<00:03:06.150> password<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:08.549> am

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
me add my Wi-Fi password and I am

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.790 
me add my Wi-Fi password and I am
connected<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.420> my<00:03:09.630> Wi-Fi<00:03:10.049> network

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.200 

it's<00:03:18.800> pretty<00:03:19.130> light<00:03:19.430> compared<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.060> my

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
it's pretty light compared to my

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.900 
it's pretty light compared to my
playbook<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.530> says<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.250> do<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
playbook and it says that do you have a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.160 
playbook and it says that do you have a
Google<00:03:23.360> account<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.190> guess<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.430> have<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.910> and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
Google account I guess I have it and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.600 
Google account I guess I have it and
there's<00:03:27.170> no<00:03:27.380> option<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.860> skip<00:03:28.190> it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
there's no option to skip it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.420 
there's no option to skip it
so<00:03:29.540> I'll<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.200> enter<00:03:30.500> my<00:03:30.650> Google<00:03:30.950> account<00:03:31.070> and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
so I'll just enter my Google account and

really nice to word it's kind of fake

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.040 
really nice to word it's kind of fake
rubberish<00:03:49.160> finish<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.850> would<00:03:50.270> say<00:03:50.600> let's<00:03:50.870> see

installed<00:04:21.410> by<00:04:21.590> before<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.570> would<00:04:23.570> say<00:04:23.840> let's<00:04:24.800> go

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
installed by before I would say let's go

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.690 
installed by before I would say let's go
to<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.460> Android<00:04:25.940> version<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.980> let's<00:04:28.340> see

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
to the Android version and let's see

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.270 
to the Android version and let's see
which<00:04:30.940> version<00:04:31.940> do<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:32.420> get<00:04:32.660> it's<00:04:32.870> Android<00:04:33.280> 4.1

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
which version do we get it's Android 4.1

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.220 
which version do we get it's Android 4.1
but<00:04:34.820> I'm<00:04:34.940> pretty<00:04:35.180> sure<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.570> will<00:04:35.660> get<00:04:35.870> update

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
but I'm pretty sure it will get update

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.780 
but I'm pretty sure it will get update
to<00:04:36.550> 4.1.1<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.740> we<00:04:39.950> just<00:04:40.100> go<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.370> display

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
to 4.1.1 and then we just go to display

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.600 
to 4.1.1 and then we just go to display
and<00:04:40.910> lower<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.540> brightness<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:42.080> little<00:04:42.110> bit<00:04:42.610> so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
and lower the brightness a little bit so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.019 
and lower the brightness a little bit so
chromatic<00:04:44.180> brightness<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:47.240> that'll<00:04:47.570> be<00:04:47.690> you

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.029 
chromatic brightness so that'll be you

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:56.029 
chromatic brightness so that'll be you
with<00:04:49.539> a<00:04:49.569> simple<00:04:50.079> pattern<00:04:50.259> on<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.009> video<00:04:53.189> and

with a simple pattern on the video and

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.549 
with a simple pattern on the video and
let<00:04:57.039> me<00:04:57.399> just<00:04:57.579> fire<00:04:57.849> up<00:04:57.999> the<00:04:58.029> web<00:04:58.329> browser<00:04:58.559> by

let me just fire up the web browser by

let me just fire up the web browser by
