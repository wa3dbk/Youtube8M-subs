of trouble
how<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.970> at<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.630> beginning<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> year

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
how have we at the beginning of the year

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.230 
how have we at the beginning of the year
talked<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.830> a<00:00:43.860> classroom<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.460> say<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.060> is

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
talked as a classroom to say this is

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000 
talked as a classroom to say this is
what<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> our<00:00:46.080> classroom<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
what we want our classroom to be like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
what we want our classroom to be like
and<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> doesn't<00:00:48.090> happen<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.020> we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and when that doesn't happen how do we

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
and when that doesn't happen how do we
talk<00:00:49.380> about<00:00:49.500> ways<00:00:49.740> to<00:00:49.980> help<00:00:50.220> it<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.430> happen

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
talk about ways to help it to happen

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
talk about ways to help it to happen
better<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.720> those<00:00:51.900> are<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.710> some

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
better so those are some I think some

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
better so those are some I think some
restorative<00:00:53.790> approaches<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.810> can<00:00:55.380> do<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
restorative approaches can can do that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.140 
restorative approaches can can do that
that<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.280> talk<00:00:56.430> about<00:00:56.550> approaches<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
that you can talk about approaches that

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.800 
that you can talk about approaches that
will<00:00:57.270> allow<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.870> happen<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:59.450> just<00:01:00.450> on<00:01:00.630> the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
will allow that to happen so just on the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.540 
will allow that to happen so just on the
process<00:01:01.200> do<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.440> suggest<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.070> leaders<00:01:02.370> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
process do you suggest the leaders of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.749 
process do you suggest the leaders of
the<00:01:02.670> school<00:01:02.730> started<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.630> think<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.670> think<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
the school started I think I think it

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.780 
the school started I think I think it
varies<00:01:06.149> and<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.899> so<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> leaders

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
varies and and so I think the leaders

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
varies and and so I think the leaders
have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.330> board<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.200> else<00:01:10.470> teachers

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
have to be on board or else teachers

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.610 
have to be on board or else teachers
feel<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:12.120> they<00:01:12.300> do<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.290> being

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
feel like what they do is not being

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.050 
feel like what they do is not being
backed<00:01:13.830> by<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> administration<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.909> they

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
backed by the administration and they

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.130 
backed by the administration and they
need<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> believe<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> administration

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
need to believe that the administration

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
need to believe that the administration
will<00:01:16.800> back<00:01:16.979> them<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.850> teachers<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.180> well<00:01:18.450> we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
will back them some teachers say well we

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.940 
will back them some teachers say well we
do<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:18.990> classroom<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
do that in our classroom but then and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
do that in our classroom but then and
Minister<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> say<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> can't<00:01:21.510> just<00:01:21.659> do

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
Minister to say well you can't just do

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
Minister to say well you can't just do
that<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.350> still<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> suspend<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that we still have to suspend that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.490 
that we still have to suspend that
person<00:01:24.120> for<00:01:24.390> three<00:01:24.690> days<00:01:24.870> because<00:01:25.350> they

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
person for three days because they

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
person for three days because they
violated<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.130> rule<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.870> think<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
violated this rule so I think the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
violated this rule so I think the
administration<00:01:28.799> has<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:29.190> be<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> board<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
administration has to be on board I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
administration has to be on board I
think<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.930> things<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
think there are some things in the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
think there are some things in the
classroom<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.920> teachers<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.460> start<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
classroom that teachers can start and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.480 
classroom that teachers can start and
and<00:01:33.900> show<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> administration<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> maybe

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and show the administration that maybe

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
and show the administration that maybe
this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> way<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.479> could<00:01:36.659> expand<00:01:37.260> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this is a way that they could expand it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
this is a way that they could expand it
into<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> broader<00:01:38.400> schools<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.540> are

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
into the broader schools so there are

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
into the broader schools so there are
into<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.140> broader<00:01:40.320> school<00:01:40.650> environment<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
into the broader school environment I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.820 
into the broader school environment I
think<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.810> sometimes<00:01:43.170> teachers<00:01:43.470> feel

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
think I think sometimes teachers feel

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.740 
think I think sometimes teachers feel
like<00:01:43.979> things<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.790> imposed<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.540> by<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
like things are imposed on them by the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.060 
like things are imposed on them by the
administration<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.710> don't<00:01:46.860> feel<00:01:47.010> like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
administration and they don't feel like

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.560 
administration and they don't feel like
they<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.490> say-so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
they have a say-so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
they have a say-so
it's<00:01:48.869> about<00:01:49.080> anything<00:01:49.799> else<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.400> we<00:01:50.490> do

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it's about anything else that we do

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's about anything else that we do
within<00:01:50.760> restorative<00:01:51.360> justice<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:52.250> we<00:01:53.250> use<00:01:53.400> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
within restorative justice we we use a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.890 
within restorative justice we we use a
collaborative<00:01:53.850> approach<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.630> ask<00:01:54.780> who

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
collaborative approach and we ask who

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.620 
collaborative approach and we ask who
needs<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.260> be<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> table<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> make<00:01:56.010> these

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
needs to be at the table to make these

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.630 
needs to be at the table to make these
and<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.469> think<00:01:57.710> schools<00:01:57.979> should<00:01:58.070> do<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.460> as

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
and I think schools should do that as

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370 
and I think schools should do that as
well<00:01:59.119> how<00:01:59.390> do<00:01:59.450> we<00:01:59.509> talk<00:01:59.719> to<00:01:59.780> teachers<00:02:00.079> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
well how do we talk to teachers and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.109 
well how do we talk to teachers and
administrators<00:02:00.890> together<00:02:01.369> rather<00:02:01.670> than<00:02:01.820> feel

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
administrators together rather than feel

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:12.650 
administrators together rather than feel
like<00:02:02.299> it's<00:02:02.750> one<00:02:03.079> doing<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.950> other

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720
