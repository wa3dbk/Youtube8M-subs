00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to all his friends this is what has done here that I present you a small 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.500
 become safer 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.320
 battlefield 3 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.530
 not towards his talent 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.570
 yesterday the 22nd of September which will be officially released on the 27th of October 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.519
 but it's a game that was developed by tahiti 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.859
 eliott edited by a threat for this summer the cards 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.509
 and in europe 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.519
 here I am going to put 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.800
 for the moment 6 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 j -c but size then to whom I want to throw 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.310
 lalle prefecture 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.310
 then the government 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 cya 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.410
 nab 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.150
 deal with these cases like this 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 not a problem 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 james 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 the agent 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.260
 this is done 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.510
 that's done 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.760
 to see anyone else we looked at the murderous mourning of his foundries in nothing 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.410
 with three people who can see me where I am 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.740
 it is this bac par excellence 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.170
 by the way I take advantage of it and I did not know the key to go crazy for 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.030
 get out of this deep hole 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.960
 that's not cool 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 that's the tactical chapel even on the cast iron plate 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.170
 up this person 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 so 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.480
 and so that graphic design point of view it's really very very good that's why 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.820
 so he asks for the graphics engine 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.060
 but it's clear that it's not shit 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.400
 when one is a little disappointed with the name of all Cubans now have another 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.340
 statesman 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.070
 he even expects this idea 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 Few people think they love him who makes heavy mistakes 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 for the members completely decomposed 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.159
 improvise 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.200
 but arm-panon the army has already taken the free version 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.469
 in good condition 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.509
 no way that's outrageous 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.509
 this fortnight 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.859
 those are things that happen 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.039
 mayor 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.429
 but he was above all playful players 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.199
 good so I'm better placed 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.529
 when we can press the screen 24 at the same time 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.700
 on the other hand we can use the arrow keys to know them in 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:53.290
 which way 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.540
 unveiled there I'm already on the battlefield I'm going to bed 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.459
 it's not my idea 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.829
 because how many times i 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.349
 utility 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 who appeared next to albi people and was mortal 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.069
 may not be present in his purpose 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.099
 maybe 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.159
 on a good 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
 on a strategic product 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:32.799
 the coup de force but no 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.979
 anyway looking around the discovery I'm selling the mayor 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.489
 close to filming 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.139
 but where everything is invented 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.139
 in front of the newspapers on the completely forgotten site 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.109
 anyway a red of course a scop but hey that bout wearing poyet 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 expect me to die tomorrow 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.579
 after all 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.579
 on each side 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.449
 sometimes I have a little trouble 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 bravo tv who are the wingers who are the enemies 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.859
 there is full axis captivated 4 years in a row to jerk off to everyone 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.839
 his mother 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.259
 and I will fight 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.259
 the man who speaks yes 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.620
 his business assembly plant 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.240
 very careful that I may die 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 but they are enemies in the vicinity 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.639
 important then this is the point of adequate tools 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.169
 oh well we won necessarily we defended very well the two sites 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.509
 they did not even break the first two kids broke 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.569
 they did not even fart the first two 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.979
 to be able to continue in the subway 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.610
 our cousins ​​to rob why 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.610
 and here I won here 17th 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.689
 April 11th 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.539
 yes yes yes good idea 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.770
 prisca jeans 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.629
 and so here is a little video to remind you that he is cured there 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:07.620
 is free 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.029
 the mastiffs even though I did not see much 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.990
 I'm going to show you the prices at the characters level because 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.639
 the mudslides of the kippur 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.979
 who will play lookout like a strong shot 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.939
 let's say we do too many bad shots are lying on the spot in the process of 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:20.440
 shoot 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.300
 ranking 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.400
 by the way that is shown in the previous video 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 it's stop it's cool, even if it's a bit boring 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.849
 logic 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.509
 so here goes to the next bill
