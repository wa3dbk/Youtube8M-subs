how<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> am<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.689> shotguns<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.170> hate<00:00:28.349> aiming

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
how I am with shotguns I hate aiming
down<00:00:28.800> site<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:30.000> think<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.269> ruins<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
down site and I think it really ruins a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
down site and I think it really ruins a
gun<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> guns<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.830> well<00:00:32.040> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
gun a lot of guns at actually well I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.860 
gun a lot of guns at actually well I
can't<00:00:32.520> lie<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> stakeout<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.450> seemed<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
can't lie the stakeout that seemed to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.120 
can't lie the stakeout that seemed to
actually<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:35.010> more

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
actually make it a little bit more

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
actually make it a little bit more
accurate<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> can't<00:00:36.600> say<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> I've<00:00:37.170> never

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
accurate so I can't say that I've never

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
accurate so I can't say that I've never
done<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.430> caught<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.700> a

think sets it above the whole treyarch

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.479 
think sets it above the whole treyarch

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
to probably the thing that I'm most

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.289 
to probably the thing that I'm most
anticipating<00:04:05.640> because<00:04:05.880> I've<00:04:06.000> been<00:04:06.120> really

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
anticipating because I've been really

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.020 
anticipating because I've been really
let<00:04:06.510> down<00:04:06.540> with<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> hit<00:04:07.049> detection<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.790> host

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
many little flaws in it and they're

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.449 
many little flaws in it and they're
taking<00:04:16.410> out<00:04:16.530> some<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.859> great<00:04:16.890> things<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
taking out some of the great things to

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.560 
taking out some of the great things to
their<00:04:17.640> taking<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:18.090> commando<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:19.049> man<00:04:19.200> army

their taking out commando one man army
second<00:04:21.570> chance<00:04:21.780> they're<00:04:22.020> removing<00:04:22.560> those<00:04:22.710> for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
second chance they're removing those for

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.040 
second chance they're removing those for
modern<00:04:23.250> warfare<00:04:23.400> 3<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.270> really<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.810> faith

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
in believing that modern warfare 3 will

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.600 
in believing that modern warfare 3 will
be<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.910> game<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.150> gay
