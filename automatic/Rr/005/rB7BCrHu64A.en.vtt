00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
viewers to demonstrate some technique
for<00:00:14.130> building<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:14.580> underwater<00:00:14.910> base<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
for building an underwater base and the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.750 
for building an underwater base and the
reason<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.500> starting<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.010> far<00:00:17.220> out<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.609> is

reason I'm starting so far out here is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.160 
reason I'm starting so far out here is
because<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.359> actually<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.750> something

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
because you can actually see something

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980 
because you can actually see something
glowing<00:00:19.560> underneath<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> water<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
glowing underneath the water and that is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
glowing underneath the water and that is
going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.710> tip<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
have played the game long enough that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.660

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
get started on your underwater base

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
get started on your underwater base
because<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> lets<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.579> you're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because it lets you see what you're

doing<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.719> I'd<00:00:33.870> say<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.320> probably<00:00:35.250> seeing

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
doing and I'd say that probably seeing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
important and more difficult than

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.229 
important and more difficult than
getting<00:00:40.800> air<00:00:41.100> under<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> water<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.000> I'll

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
getting air under the water and I'll

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.410 
getting air under the water and I'll
explain<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.850> let<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:44.879> jump<00:00:45.329> down

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to my faith here I picked this site here

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.100 
to my faith here I picked this site here
because<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> deepest<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.930> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because one of the deepest and it's not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.369 
because one of the deepest and it's not
necessarily<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.860> next<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.910> base<00:00:51.170> as<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
necessarily right next to my base as you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
necessarily right next to my base as you
can<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.649> I've<00:00:52.770> already<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.370> gotten

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
can see I've already kind of gotten

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
can see I've already kind of gotten
started<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.120> something<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.930> made<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
started with something but I made a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
started with something but I made a
mistake<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> wanted<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> restart<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.820> my

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
mistake so I wanted to restart here my

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.189 
mistake so I wanted to restart here my
mistake<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.780> didn't<00:00:57.989> bring<00:00:58.140> enough

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
mistake was that I didn't bring enough

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.799 
mistake was that I didn't bring enough
mud<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.859> me<00:00:59.059> in<00:01:00.059> fact<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.359> brought<00:01:00.570> another

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
mud with me in fact I brought another

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
mud with me in fact I brought another
stone<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> wanted

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
stone as you can see but what I wanted

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
stone as you can see but what I wanted
to<00:01:03.359> say<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.100> obviously<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to say first is that obviously be the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
to say first is that obviously be the
hardest<00:01:06.090> part<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.799> about<00:01:07.799> getting

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
hardest part I think about getting

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.490 
hardest part I think about getting
started<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.580> underwater<00:01:08.939> base<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
started with your underwater base is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.090 
started with your underwater base is
light<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> you've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.869> sulfur<00:01:13.500> light

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
light and if you've got a sulfur light

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700 
light and if you've got a sulfur light
stone<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> nether<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.840> you've<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
stone from the nether then you've got a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
stone from the nether then you've got a
great<00:01:16.950> head<00:01:17.159> start<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> take<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
great head start I'm going to take it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.530 
great head start I'm going to take it
off<00:01:18.270> peaceful<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.299> I<00:01:21.299> can

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
the first part of building you don't

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.389 
the first part of building you don't
want<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.780> put<00:01:56.869> yourself<00:01:57.110> in<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.229> middle<00:01:57.399> you

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
want to put yourself in the middle you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.330 
want to put yourself in the middle you
want<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:59.020> fill<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.229> middle<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.189> you've<00:02:01.310> got

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
want to fill in the middle so you've got

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.690 
want to fill in the middle so you've got
a<00:02:01.429> three<00:02:01.640> by<00:02:01.759> three<00:02:01.789> by<00:02:02.060> three<00:02:02.240> blocks<00:02:02.479> cube

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
a three by three by three blocks cube

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.609 
a three by three by three blocks cube
the<00:02:04.929> 3d<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.170> when<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.219> destroy<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.939> brick<00:02:08.619> in

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the 3d and when you destroy a brick in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.250 
the 3d and when you destroy a brick in
the<00:02:09.799> cube<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.299> was<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> rush<00:02:11.959> in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the cube the one was going to rush in

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.280 
the cube the one was going to rush in
but<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.160> not<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.730> make<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.910> well<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
but it's not going to make a well and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.720 
but it's not going to make a well and
you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.440> actually<00:02:15.709> get<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> little<00:02:16.340> bit<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.459> air

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
you can actually get a little bit of air

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.509 
you can actually get a little bit of air
just<00:02:17.239> from<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> top<00:02:17.750> there<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.430> do

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
just from the top there and you can do

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.660 
just from the top there and you can do
that<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> center<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.269> your<00:02:20.360> queue<00:02:21.670> which

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
that to the center of your queue which

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.059 
will give you a little area that you can
rest<00:02:25.579> in<00:02:26.079> get<00:02:27.079> air<00:02:27.260> back<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.860> can<00:02:27.980> even

rest in get air back and you can even

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.069 
rest in get air back and you can even
put<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.250> torch<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:28.549> there<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.750> going<00:02:29.989> to

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
put a torch in there and that's going to

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.690 
put a torch in there and that's going to
help<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.380> see<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:30.920> doing<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.370> well

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
as give you air now that is actually the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.360 
as give you air now that is actually the
most<00:02:34.340> difficult<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.239> get<00:02:35.480> air<00:02:35.690> underneath

most difficult way to get air underneath

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.210 
most difficult way to get air underneath
the<00:02:37.370> easiest<00:02:37.849> ways<00:02:38.030> are<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:39.319> ladder<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.769> door

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the easiest ways are the ladder and door

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.190 
the easiest ways are the ladder and door
method<00:02:40.640> mmm<00:02:41.209> i<00:02:41.299> believe<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> door<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.079> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
method mmm i believe the door is the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.039 
method mmm i believe the door is the
absolute<00:02:42.650> easiest<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.150> requires<00:02:44.450> only<00:02:44.629> six

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
absolute easiest as it requires only six

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.539 
absolute easiest as it requires only six
wood<00:02:45.430> planks<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.810> build<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:49.129> don't<00:02:49.310> need

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
wood planks to build and you don't need

the<00:03:36.560> benefit<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.010> course<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.760> that

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the benefit of course to this is that

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.659 
the benefit of course to this is that
you<00:03:38.030> can<00:03:38.209> put<00:03:38.389> ladders<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:40.130> over<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.459> place

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
you can put ladders all over the place

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.280 
you can put ladders all over the place
and<00:03:41.680> remove<00:03:42.680> one<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.239> you've<00:03:44.450> got<00:03:44.630> Oakland

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
and remove one and you've got Oakland

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.470 
and remove one and you've got Oakland
you've<00:03:45.709> got<00:03:45.889> an<00:03:46.069> area<00:03:46.340> there<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:47.239> is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
you've got an area there that is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
you've got an area there that is
essentially

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
essentially

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.920 
essentially
no<00:03:50.220> longer<00:03:50.490> contains<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.970> well<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.390> then<00:03:51.900> you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
no longer contains a well and then you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.050 
no longer contains a well and then you
can<00:03:52.140> use<00:03:52.380> let's<00:03:52.980> say<00:03:53.100> I'll<00:03:53.400> block<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.700> off

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
can use let's say I'll block this off

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.370 
can use let's say I'll block this off
here<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:54.990> put<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.110> torch

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
here and then you can put a torch

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.040 
here and then you can put a torch
underneath<00:03:55.710> see<00:03:56.610> what<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> did<00:03:56.790> there<00:03:57.050> ladder

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
underneath see what I did there ladder

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.110 
underneath see what I did there ladder
ladder<00:03:58.260> ladder<00:03:58.410> ladder<00:03:58.650> ladder<00:03:58.880> one<00:03:59.880> block

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
ladder ladder ladder ladder one block

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
ladder ladder ladder ladder one block
that<00:04:00.330> I've<00:04:00.480> removed<00:04:00.750> after<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.230> put<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> ladder

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
that I've removed after I put a ladder

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.860 
that I've removed after I put a ladder
in<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.190> then<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.760> block<00:04:03.060> off<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.480> exits<00:04:03.570> so

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
in it and then I block off the exits so

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.270 
in it and then I block off the exits so
you<00:04:03.960> can<00:04:04.050> put<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> torch<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.830> can<00:04:04.980> see<00:04:05.160> what

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
you can put a torch you can see what

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.010 
you can put a torch you can see what
you're<00:04:05.370> doing<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.420> get<00:04:06.540> started<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.959> your

you're doing you can get started on your

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.260 
you're doing you can get started on your
underwater<00:04:07.350> base<00:04:07.640> now<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:08.940> from<00:04:09.120> this

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.880 
can see from the surface here a pretty
well<00:05:34.050> lit<00:05:34.290> area<00:05:34.979> mmm<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.870> i'll<00:05:37.710> show<00:05:37.740> you

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
inside and out quickly and that'll be

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.659 
inside and out quickly and that'll be
the<00:05:40.020> end<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.350> video<00:05:40.440> unfortunately<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.490> i

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
the end of the video unfortunately but i

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.040 
the end of the video unfortunately but i
think<00:05:42.030> i've<00:05:42.150> showed<00:05:42.390> you<00:05:42.419> what<00:05:42.690> i<00:05:42.750> really<00:05:43.020> need

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
think i've showed you what i really need

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.280 
think i've showed you what i really need
to<00:05:43.260> show<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:44.330> underwater<00:05:45.330> of<00:05:45.630> course<00:05:45.900> it's<00:05:46.140> so

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
to show you underwater of course it's so

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.360 
to show you underwater of course it's so
much<00:05:46.470> harder<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:47.010> what's<00:05:47.220> going<00:05:47.520> on<00:05:47.660> but

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
much harder to see what's going on but

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.560 
much harder to see what's going on but
you<00:05:50.370> could<00:05:50.580> see<00:05:50.790> from<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.060> surface<00:05:51.270> that

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
you could see from the surface that

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.690 
you could see from the surface that
looks<00:05:51.810> like<00:05:51.900> I've<00:05:52.020> got<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.169> big<00:05:52.410> glass<00:05:52.740> dome<00:05:53.040> and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
looks like I've got a big glass dome and

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.550 
looks like I've got a big glass dome and
let's<00:05:54.210> go<00:05:54.330> underneath<00:05:54.630> their<00:05:54.930> show<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:55.260> guys

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
let's go underneath their show you guys

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.930 
let's go underneath their show you guys
it's<00:05:55.710> really<00:05:55.830> like<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.430> took<00:05:56.610> me<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.790> little

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
it's really like this took me a little

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.310 
it's really like this took me a little
while<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.450> I<00:05:57.540> wasn't<00:05:57.810> really<00:05:57.900> using<00:05:58.139> the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
while and I wasn't really using the

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.830 
while and I wasn't really using the
right<00:05:58.500> techniques<00:05:58.950> at<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.220> time<00:05:59.400> I<00:06:00.330> wasn't

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
right techniques at the time I wasn't

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.360 
right techniques at the time I wasn't
using<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.290> ladder<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.560> door<00:06:01.830> technique<00:06:02.040> I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
using the ladder and door technique I

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.430 
using the ladder and door technique I
don't<00:06:02.850> have<00:06:03.000> any<00:06:03.120> luminance<00:06:03.570> because<00:06:03.930> it's<00:06:04.260> a

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
don't have any luminance because it's a

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.170 
don't have any luminance because it's a
multiplayer<00:06:04.980> online<00:06:05.160> server<00:06:05.639> and<00:06:05.880> I<00:06:05.940> don't

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
multiplayer online server and I don't

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.140 
multiplayer online server and I don't
think<00:06:06.450> they've<00:06:06.600> enabled<00:06:06.840> hell<00:06:07.230> mode<00:06:07.440> yet<00:06:08.150> but

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
think they've enabled hell mode yet but
