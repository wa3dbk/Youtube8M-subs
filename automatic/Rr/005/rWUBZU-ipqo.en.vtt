that's good I'm trippin right now this

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.180 
that's good I'm trippin right now this
isn't<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:17.330> tank<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.920> bomb<00:03:20.830> front<00:03:21.830> panels

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
isn't the tank is the bomb front panels

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.650 
isn't the tank is the bomb front panels
usually<00:03:22.520> for<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.790> size<00:03:22.970> tanks<00:03:23.300> like<00:03:23.420> an<00:03:23.540> inch

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
usually for this size tanks like an inch

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.180 
usually for this size tanks like an inch
and<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> quarter<00:03:23.990> we<00:03:24.560> made<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:24.770> two<00:03:25.010> inches

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and a quarter we made it two inches

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.860 
and a quarter we made it two inches
thick<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.970> technically<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.630> bulletproof

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
thick so technically it's bulletproof

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.860 
thick so technically it's bulletproof
you<00:03:27.440> can<00:03:27.560> put<00:03:27.710> five<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.130> ten<00:03:28.340> guys<00:03:28.970> bulletproof

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you can put five to ten guys bulletproof

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.690 
you can put five to ten guys bulletproof
bulletproof<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.980> going<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.250> say<00:03:31.460> I<00:03:31.490> mean

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
bulletproof I was going to say I mean

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.220 
bulletproof I was going to say I mean
it's<00:03:31.880> going<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.120> take<00:03:32.270> a<00:03:32.300> lot<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.570> course<00:03:32.900> with

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
it's going to take a lot of course with

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's going to take a lot of course with
skateboard<00:03:33.860> log<00:03:34.130> dude<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:35.060> could<00:03:35.150> take<00:03:35.209> ten<00:03:35.570> of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
skateboard log dude it could take ten of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.840 
skateboard log dude it could take ten of
your<00:03:35.720> forces<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.290> bulletproof<00:03:36.890> when<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
your forces on bulletproof when the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.820 
your forces on bulletproof when the
tanks<00:03:38.180> understands<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.140> over<00:03:39.380> eight<00:03:39.590> feet
