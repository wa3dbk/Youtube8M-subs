of<00:01:57.060> course<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.540> put<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.900> manual<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of course you can put it in manual and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
of course you can put it in manual and
that<00:01:59.070> allows<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> control<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> vehicle

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that allows you to control the vehicle

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.710 
that allows you to control the vehicle
through<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.200> shifters<00:02:02.330> then<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.570> my

then<00:03:44.180> we'll<00:03:44.540> moved<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:45.050> up<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.260> notch<00:03:45.470> during

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
then we'll moved it up a notch during

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.850 
then we'll moved it up a notch during
the<00:03:46.250> Black<00:03:46.490> Series<00:03:46.820> AMG<00:03:47.600> s<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.140> all<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.620> time

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.950 
the Black Series AMG s and all the time
that<00:03:49.100> was<00:03:49.250> really<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.700> strategy<00:03:50.480> the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
that was really a strategy the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.020 
that was really a strategy the
electrolytic<00:03:51.260> AMG<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.130> building<00:03:52.430> its<00:03:52.580> unique

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
electrolytic AMG to building its unique

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.720 
electrolytic AMG to building its unique
platform<00:03:53.810> it's<00:03:54.470> unique<00:03:54.650> looking<00:03:55.250> at<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.520> car

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
platform it's unique looking at a car

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.380 
platform it's unique looking at a car
that<00:03:55.880> was<00:03:56.000> just<00:03:56.150> pure<00:03:56.510> DNA<00:03:57.130> AMG<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.340> here<00:03:59.300> it

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
that was just pure DNA AMG and here it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.960 
that was just pure DNA AMG and here it
is

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.120 

it<00:04:07.390> seems<00:04:07.690> like<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.020> boys<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.500> mercedes<00:04:08.920> AMG

our<00:04:20.709> target<00:04:21.010> was<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.310> no<00:04:21.489> idea<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.360> would

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
our target was a no idea that we would

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.180 
our target was a no idea that we would
like<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.780> make<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> super<00:04:23.290> sports<00:04:23.530> car<00:04:23.650> because

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
like to make a super sports car because

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.760 
like to make a super sports car because
we<00:04:24.430> all<00:04:24.520> know<00:04:24.550> more<00:04:25.420> than<00:04:25.600> 40<00:04:25.960> years<00:04:26.200> in<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
we all know more than 40 years in the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.980 
we all know more than 40 years in the
market<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.280> therefore<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.330> thought<00:04:28.570> now<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
market and therefore we thought now the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.470 
market and therefore we thought now the
time<00:04:29.410> should<00:04:29.740> be<00:04:29.770> mature<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.940> be<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.300> will

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
time should be mature that be it will

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.850 
time should be mature that be it will

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
philosophy force good our our idea was

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.330 
philosophy force good our our idea was
that<00:04:47.920> we<00:04:48.580> are<00:04:48.940> not<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.690> mass<00:04:49.990> production

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
that we are not the mass production

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.260 
that we are not the mass production
brand<00:04:51.340> we<00:04:51.640> are<00:04:51.760> how<00:04:52.720> should<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.990> say<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.250> small

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
brand we are how should I say a small

products<00:04:57.580> very<00:04:58.090> individual<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:59.080> therefore

products very individual and therefore

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.980 
products very individual and therefore
we<00:04:59.830> thought<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.340> might<00:05:00.400> be<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.990> good

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
we thought it might be a good

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.350 
we thought it might be a good
opportunity<00:05:02.830> for<00:05:03.160> us<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.460> show<00:05:03.790> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.920 
capability and at the end equality in
our<00:05:07.150> products<00:05:07.660> when<00:05:08.169> one<00:05:08.620> engineer<00:05:09.490> is

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
our products when one engineer is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.390 
our products when one engineer is
manufacturing<00:05:10.930> one<00:05:11.710> engine<00:05:12.070> therefore

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
manufacturing one engine therefore

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.720 
manufacturing one engine therefore
that's<00:05:12.520> our<00:05:12.700> philosophy<00:05:12.930> 191<00:05:13.930> and
