00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello very good 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 on how to duplicate the weapons because it is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 different from the objects first thing 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 what we have to do is be connected 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 to Internet 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 well we would not come to online options and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.360
 with these internet like to go see the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.490
 cndh 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.390
 of second we have that there is a store gives 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.730
 same the store that is 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.450
 the problem we come we give 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 exchange for to sell you 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.340
 we sell the weapon that we want to duplicate 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 well yours came here with the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.730
 inventory a little more empty but good 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.890
 as neither 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.710
 just fine to try it and do it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.260
 just in case it works yes tell you 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.180
 that today we are July 8, 2015 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.909
 so you know that until today 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.380
 the trick works and well the first thing that 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.009
 we would do is sell a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 a weapon with those of cruel but good 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.960
 so that he sees that it is different then 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 I could do it with the zebra machete 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340
 example that as you see I only have now 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.380
 same one here 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.109
 and good they would sell in machete zebra 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.730
 gave like and to sell it and as you see 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.980
 you can buy it 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.830
 Now what we would do is look for a 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.630
 object that we have a lot or everything 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.080
 that we want to duplicate it, for example 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.990
 and to use the pick we give to the X 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.020
 to sell and just when we get out 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 this menu what we do is remove the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.280
 cable and internet 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.530
 so that the trick works because 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.910
 we are with this time we remove the cable 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.310
 internet as you see it appears that no 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.640
 we are connected that the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.340
 connection does not leave behind the loss of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.860
 connection we give the X the menu follows 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.050
 still there we will buy back 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.250
 which is the weapon that we had and the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.240
 amount that we want I have little 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 inventory but well I think I do not know 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.479
 6 space I think I have I'm going to buy 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.760
 10 because I do not have space anymore 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.170
 but hey I would give them the X and instead 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.370
 to sell because what it does is that we have 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 bought maybe you have brought to not 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.560
 appear what you buy back good tells me 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.500
 that I do not have enough slot but 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 good as you see here I have a machete of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 software had only one and I have now 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.049
 same 5 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.909
 and a Danish has been everything I hope you 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.439
