I repeat change direction now there I'm
getting<00:07:17.950> movement<00:07:18.160> I<00:07:18.520> think<00:07:18.910> it's<00:07:19.030> trying<00:07:19.210> to

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
getting movement I think it's trying to

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:38.470 
getting movement I think it's trying to
respond<00:07:19.690> good
