00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.170
 and then gang beauty here is this I 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm with a summer button set 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.820
 Button and driver side set 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.130
 The stick is working straight and it's not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 running is working from the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.199
 passenger 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 you can see the difference here 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.940
 here is the next button in the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.400
 and does not sell with a whip 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 to be replacing here in the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.370
 if it only comes from a button it comes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 so no whip right here is the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 Next we'll need this 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.130

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 new button is the next button it comes 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.870
 with the numbering that you can 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.250
 see better 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:09.920
 I'll put it here to show you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:09.920
 here is the following yesterday 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 ok 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:26.670
 Ok, let me see that one goes in that position. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:29.370
 So it would be like this 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 here is the number 1 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.159
 he sends a signal for his 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 passenger 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 right is what I get yellow 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 number two it goes up the side of the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.229
 passenger being the end of the blue color 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 number 3 it goes down the side of the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240
 driver who is the white wire 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.090
 number 4, which is the green wire, it goes up 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.220
 driver side 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.470
 the number 5 which is the black wire with list 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.400
 is the key point that feeds 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 the button and number 6 would be the negative 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.350
 right here is the connection schema 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.200
 turn everything off at once 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.599

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.200
