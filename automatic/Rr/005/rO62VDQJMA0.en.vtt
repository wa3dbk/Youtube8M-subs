going<00:01:39.399> through<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.670> struggles<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.149> had

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
going through the struggles that I had

going through the struggles that I had
and<00:01:40.540> other<00:01:41.439> people<00:01:41.710> just<00:01:41.860> living<00:01:41.979> normal

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
and other people just living normal

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.760 
and other people just living normal
lives<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.270> being<00:01:43.539> like<00:01:43.750> trying<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.649> be

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770

a<00:01:49.420> struggle<00:01:49.630> well<00:01:50.049> honestly<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.430> don't

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
a struggle well honestly and I don't

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.310 
a struggle well honestly and I don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
know if I'd still be in the church if I

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.740 
know if I'd still be in the church if I
