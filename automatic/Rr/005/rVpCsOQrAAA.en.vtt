 you deserve lumia 625 that has arrived by 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.020
 the tactile change in this case its 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 phones are very simple because the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.870
 touch does not come with ub stick which 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 it becomes easier to change and not run 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 so many risks when changing 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.780
 then we are going to help us from a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.210
 card 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:28.300
 and we're going to move it around the edge 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.300
 take off the tapes that karting brings 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.809
 and so be able to take off from late that 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.809
 we are going to replace 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 if we want we can give warmth so that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.910
 the glue will loosen easier if there is no 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.010
 problem then let's have patience 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 we are strengthening the card 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.680

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.940
 lean on the display and go to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.940
 damage the display 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.030
 gently let's take it off 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 and we have it then take off and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.350
 remove the rings beforehand 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.350

 and now we have our glass 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
 unhooked for only clean well and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.420
 already as the glass this brings a ribbon 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 adhesive 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 we do not have to put double face without 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.030
 But I want to put more to the sides 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 so that I burn now adhered 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.090

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.630
