00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
tweak you can increase it to a second

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.309 
tweak you can increase it to a second
two<00:01:01.489> seconds<00:01:01.969> but<00:01:02.120> too<00:01:02.539> long<00:01:02.749> is<00:01:02.960> annoying<00:01:03.289> so

want<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.520> go<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.840> system<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:10.190> system<00:02:11.030> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
want you to go to system so system and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.830 
want you to go to system so system and
then<00:02:13.550> library<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.600> down

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
then library and then go down

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580 
then library and then go down
into<00:02:20.620> private<00:02:21.220> frameworks

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
into private frameworks

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.930 
into private frameworks
so<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:25.040> private<00:02:25.370> frameworks<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
so there you have private frameworks and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.210 
so there you have private frameworks and
once<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.660> private<00:02:26.990> frameworks<00:02:27.440> keep<00:02:27.830> going

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
once in private frameworks keep going

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
once in private frameworks keep going
down<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.910> very<00:02:29.180> end<00:02:32.410> where<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.620> see<00:02:34.240> oops

not very and actually the last real

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.100 
not very and actually the last real
framework<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.569> teensy<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:41.150> right<00:02:41.540> there

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
framework so teensy so it's right there

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.670 
framework so teensy so it's right there
select<00:02:42.770> your<00:02:42.920> framework<00:02:43.190> sorry<00:02:43.610> about<00:02:43.760> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
files in there open up system sound

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.320 
files in there open up system sound
vibration<00:02:55.520> pattern<00:02:56.000> stop<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.570> list<00:02:58.330> okay

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
vibration pattern stop you list okay

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.390 
vibration pattern stop you list okay
there<00:02:59.630> you'll<00:02:59.840> have<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.380> all<00:03:00.650> these<00:03:00.830> text

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
understand under their race right here

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.370 
understand under their race right here
as<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.260> see<00:03:06.350> default<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:08.110> where<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.230> need
