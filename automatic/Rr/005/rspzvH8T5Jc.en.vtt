that's of

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.470 
that's of
on<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:25.010> Quran<00:05:26.010> here<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.090> there's<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.300> big

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
on of Quran here so there's a big

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.060 
on of Quran here so there's a big
difference<00:05:27.690> between<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.410> way<00:05:28.500> they<00:05:28.710> live<00:05:28.950> in

difference between the way they live in

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.370 
difference between the way they live in
I<00:05:29.220> live<00:05:29.580> that's<00:05:30.030> why<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:30.660> hard<00:05:30.690> for<00:05:30.960> me<00:05:31.080> to

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
I live that's why it's so hard for me to

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.830 
I live that's why it's so hard for me to
live<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.130> way<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.430> do<00:05:32.760> live<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.240> way<00:05:33.360> they<00:05:33.390> live

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
live the way I do live the way they live

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.800 
live the way I do live the way they live
so<00:05:34.140> it's<00:05:34.290> a<00:05:34.350> big<00:05:34.560> conflict<00:05:34.920> of<00:05:35.160> interest<00:05:35.580> and

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
so it's a big conflict of interest and

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.240 
so it's a big conflict of interest and
conflict<00:05:36.810> or<00:05:36.930> personality<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.770> what<00:05:37.920> we<00:05:38.010> like

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250
