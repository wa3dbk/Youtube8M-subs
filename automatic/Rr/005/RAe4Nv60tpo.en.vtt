00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.890
 well first I was grateful to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.320
 with the directors of the coaching staff 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.969
 for trust and for having brought me 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.700
 because the building the part of the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.830
 institution and obviously very happy 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.030
 will come to a team as big as 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.440
 millionaires 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.080
 and I met a human group 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.529
 incredible that I know of the desire that they have 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 of getting important things and I think 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.510
 that I can contribute my grain of sand to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.699
 go all together to get those 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.030
 objectives that in the end we can celebrate 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.680
 in international cup to the local environment 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.290
 the jump I will ask what are the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.449
 objectives that have uribe command with 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.940
 millionaires that will provide us with the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.110
 sportingly good before all the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.839
 delivery in each game and that I think 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.600
 which is something that can not be negotiated 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.150
 nothing of the world and obviously everything 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 what can bring them with goals with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.700
 all that intensity of play that you can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.060
 contribute in each game and adapt to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.820
 what the coaching staff says to the group 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.649
 that there is already a way of the process that they bring 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.979
 I think that's going to be fundamental 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.190
 so you can be at the highest level 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.490
 and finally fight the titles that 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.820
 we are playing and if so, too 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 try to fight for that golden booty that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.460
 it's so important for a striker 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 we understand that he had many 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 concerts or other options to play and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.810
 consider outside because that came to him 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.730
 final to decide to win 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.050
 good more than anything 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.260
 I believe that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.400
 the desire to work with a group like 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:15.450
 the one that is outside as much of players 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:18.920
 as a technical team people I've seen 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:24.780
 and the progress he has had as a team 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 since the arrival of juanma so that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.599
 it took me to love above other 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.680
 offers to millionaires but it 's a 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.489
 incredibly bloated and always that that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.430
 he plays in full Bogota in the stadium and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:45.250
 put the support that has the group 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.290
 to the team then I think that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 it's just giving me the maximum and waiting 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.610
 start very well the tournaments that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.570
 let's go play and win the love of 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.570
 the people little by little 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.830
 of those fans that fernando comes to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.420
 deliver everything 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.090
 to the maximum of his abilities to take 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.860
 this champion team and that we're going to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.370
 pull to the same side to get 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.370
 that goal
