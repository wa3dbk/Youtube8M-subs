that<00:00:47.239> push<00:00:47.449> out<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.870> car<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:48.199> just<00:00:48.829> much

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
that push out to the car it's just much

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.680 
that push out to the car it's just much
easier<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.489> use<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:49.640> little<00:00:49.940> foam<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.300> look<00:00:50.540> like

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
easier to use a little foam to look like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.529 
easier to use a little foam to look like
this<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:51.829> pretty<00:00:51.920> simple<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:53.420> wanna

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
this so it's pretty simple just wanna

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.080 
this so it's pretty simple just wanna
chop<00:00:53.780> off<00:00:53.929> the<00:00:54.079> end<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:54.789> you<00:00:55.789> literally

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
chop off the end and then you literally

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.779 
chop off the end and then you literally
just<00:00:56.420> twist<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.039> could<00:00:58.190> kind<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.519> stop

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
just twist and you could kind of stop

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.160
