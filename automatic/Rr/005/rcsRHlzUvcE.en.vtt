said<00:00:08.270> no<00:00:08.420> question<00:00:08.809> is<00:00:08.930> so<00:00:09.139> difficult<00:00:09.620> as<00:00:09.860> that

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
said no question is so difficult as that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.789 
said no question is so difficult as that
which<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:10.430> answer<00:00:10.670> is<00:00:10.760> obvious<00:00:11.119> and<00:00:11.680> I<00:00:12.680> think

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
which the answer is obvious and I think

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.430 
which the answer is obvious and I think
that<00:00:13.100> applies<00:00:13.369> here<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:13.730> that<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.510> the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
that applies here is that the the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.019 
that applies here is that the the
question<00:00:15.770> seems<00:00:15.980> difficult<00:00:16.430> because<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:16.910> so

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
question seems difficult because it's so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.279 
question seems difficult because it's so
obvious<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:17.660> we<00:00:17.690> think<00:00:17.930> there<00:00:18.050> must<00:00:18.140> be

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
obvious and we think there must be

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.870 
obvious and we think there must be
something<00:00:18.529> simpler<00:00:18.949> there<00:00:19.609> must<00:00:19.789> be

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
something simpler there must be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.310 
something simpler there must be
something<00:00:20.179> more<00:00:20.210> complicated<00:00:20.869> but<00:00:21.140> actually

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
something more complicated but actually

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560 
something more complicated but actually
the<00:00:21.589> answer<00:00:21.800> is<00:00:21.859> very<00:00:21.890> simple<00:00:22.070> from<00:00:22.999> me

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
the answer is very simple from me

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.140 
the answer is very simple from me
the<00:00:23.720> key<00:00:23.960> is<00:00:24.669> stillness<00:00:25.669> and<00:00:26.029> quietness<00:00:26.619> I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
the key is stillness and quietness I
