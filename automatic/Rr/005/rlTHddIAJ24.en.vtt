00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
extensions well I've had their

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.000

extensions<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:06.660> about<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> month<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.500> I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
extensions for about a month now and I

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.470 
extensions for about a month now and I
think<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.460> that's<00:00:08.670> long<00:00:08.970> enough<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.330> me<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
think that that's long enough for me to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
think that that's long enough for me to
give<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.809> guys<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> pretty<00:00:10.440> decent<00:00:10.889> idea<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
give you guys a pretty decent idea of

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.980 
give you guys a pretty decent idea of
how<00:00:11.490> they're<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> hold<00:00:11.969> up<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
how they're going to hold up for you so

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.169 
how they're going to hold up for you so
as<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.620> softness<00:00:14.130> cause<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.820> might<00:00:15.030> have

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
as for softness cause they might have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
as for softness cause they might have
lost<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.630> softness<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.410> tiny<00:00:16.740> bit<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.699> they

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
lost a softness to a tiny bit for they

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
lost a softness to a tiny bit for they
are<00:00:17.850> still<00:00:18.150> relatively<00:00:18.660> soft<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.619> see

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
are still relatively soft as you can see

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.620 
are still relatively soft as you can see
they<00:00:19.920> brush<00:00:20.130> through<00:00:20.310> nice<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.550> easy<00:00:20.910> they

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

they react to being washed um I don't

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.290

recommend<00:00:35.399> putting<00:00:35.670> product<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> your

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
recommend putting product in your

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
recommend putting product in your
extensions<00:00:36.870> there's<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.320> no<00:00:37.500> need<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
extensions there's really no need for it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
extensions there's really no need for it
um<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.590> possible

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
um you see on them as little as possible

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
um you see on them as little as possible
because<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.550> does<00:00:41.730> uh<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:43.590> give<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because it does uh you know give you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
because it does uh you know give you
split<00:00:44.370> ends<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.000> can't<00:00:45.239> grow<00:00:45.420> back

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
split ends and then they can't grow back

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.590 
split ends and then they can't grow back
so<00:00:46.399> they<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.730> shorter<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.120> shorter<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so they just get shorter and shorter in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
so they just get shorter and shorter in
my<00:00:48.690> experience<00:00:49.230> Mike's<00:00:50.190> entrance<00:00:50.489> always

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
my experience Mike's entrance always

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
my experience Mike's entrance always
just<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.000> shorter<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.360> shorter<00:00:51.449> no<00:00:51.809> longer<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
just get shorter and shorter no longer I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.500 
just get shorter and shorter no longer I
have<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.489> every<00:00:53.969> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> new

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
have them so every kind of get a new

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
have them so every kind of get a new
pair<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> extensions<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.350> try<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> wait<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.949> long

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
pair of extensions I try to wait as long

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
pair of extensions I try to wait as long
as<00:00:56.219> possible<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.030> heat<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
as possible to use heat on them so I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
as possible to use heat on them so I
haven't<00:00:58.079> used<00:00:58.199> adding<00:00:58.590> yacht<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> think

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
haven't used adding yacht so I think

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
haven't used adding yacht so I think
they're<00:00:59.850> holding<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.660> great<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.109> far

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
they're holding up really great so far

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
they're holding up really great so far
compared<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.070> Sally's<00:01:02.430> extensions

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
compared to my Sally's extensions

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
compared to my Sally's extensions
they're<00:01:03.090> probably<00:01:03.270> holding<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.840> around<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
they're probably holding up around this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.219 
they're probably holding up around this
thing<00:01:04.670> they're<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:06.450> extension<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
thing they're just good extension to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.280 
thing they're just good extension to
their<00:01:07.350> sock<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:08.400> long<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.630> clip<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.080> while

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
extensions the main thing I love about

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
extensions the main thing I love about
them<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> links<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.750> hard<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
them is the links it was really hard to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
them is the links it was really hard to
find<00:01:55.259> hair<00:01:55.409> extensions<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.219> length<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
find hair extensions that have length to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
find hair extensions that have length to
them<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.479> compared<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> Sally's<00:01:58.649> i

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
them like this compared to Sally's i

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
them like this compared to Sally's i
would<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.070> read<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> same

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
would actually read them about the same

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
would actually read them about the same
just<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.079> only<00:02:01.290> bad<00:02:01.439> thing<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just the only bad thing about these is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
just the only bad thing about these is
probably<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.329> thickness<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> length<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
probably the thickness and the length is

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
probably the thickness and the length is
a<00:02:04.590> lot<00:02:04.829> better<00:02:04.950> than<00:02:05.219> Sally's<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.119> you're

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
a lot better than Sally's but you're

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.230 
a lot better than Sally's but you're
also<00:02:06.360> paying<00:02:06.659> more

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
also paying more

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.600 
also paying more
kind<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.659> evens<00:02:07.990> itself<00:02:08.140> oh<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.009> overall<00:02:09.369> I'm

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
kind of evens itself oh so overall I'm

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.979 
kind of evens itself oh so overall I'm
really<00:02:09.729> pleased<00:02:10.119> with<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> extensions<00:02:10.869> I'm

them when I need them and the good thing

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
them when I need them and the good thing
about<00:02:14.770> dirty<00:02:15.130> looks<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:16.330> sell<00:02:16.569> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
about dirty looks is that they sell the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.839 
about dirty looks is that they sell the
individual<00:02:17.319> less<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.069> instead<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.550> buying<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
individual less so instead of buying a

individual less so instead of buying a
whole<00:02:19.000> new<00:02:19.150> set<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.290> rotate<00:02:20.620> out<00:02:21.099> and
