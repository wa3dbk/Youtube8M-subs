00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the black bezel it's also more flush to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.490 
the black bezel it's also more flush to
the<00:02:13.560> phone<00:02:13.860> than

iphone 4s if you remember the bezel

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.580 
iphone 4s if you remember the bezel
sticks<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:17.710> quite<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> bit<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.060> much

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
sticks out quite a bit and this is much

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.830 
sticks out quite a bit and this is much
closer<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.950> flush<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.520> body<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
closer and flush to the body of the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840 
closer and flush to the body of the
phone<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.650> black<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.580> makes

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
phone and it's black and it really makes

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.630 
phone and it's black and it really makes
the<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:25.750> least<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.650> black<00:02:26.890> iphone<00:02:27.340> really

stand out it looks nice so that's a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.880 
stand out it looks nice so that's a
quick<00:02:32.980> tour<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.270> iphone<00:02:35.080> 5<00:02:35.380> let's<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.860> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
quick tour of the iphone 5 let's do a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.470 
quick tour of the iphone 5 let's do a
quick<00:02:36.700> comparison<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:38.590> iphone<00:02:39.220> 5<00:02:39.520> vs<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
quick comparison of the iphone 5 vs the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.020 
quick comparison of the iphone 5 vs the
4s<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.260> starting<00:02:44.860> off<00:02:44.950> with<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> iphone<00:02:45.580> 5<00:02:45.820> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
4s so starting off with the iphone 5 you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.960 
4s so starting off with the iphone 5 you
got<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> 4-inch<00:02:46.750> Retina<00:02:47.140> display<00:02:47.560> again<00:02:48.100> 1136

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
got the 4-inch Retina display again 1136

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.400 
got the 4-inch Retina display again 1136

retina display which is 640 x 960 or 960
x<00:02:58.060> 640<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.500> iphone<00:02:59.860> 5<00:03:00.160> i<00:03:00.190> don't<00:03:00.520> know<00:03:00.580> if<00:03:00.670> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
x 640 the iphone 5 i don't know if you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.120 
x 640 the iphone 5 i don't know if you
can<00:03:00.820> see<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.660> color<00:03:02.170> saturation<00:03:02.800> is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
can see if that the color saturation is

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.080 
can see if that the color saturation is
definitely<00:03:04.200> deeper<00:03:05.200> than<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.709> 4s<00:03:06.370> but

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
definitely deeper than the 4s but

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.690 
definitely deeper than the 4s but
overall<00:03:07.360> both<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.500> displays<00:03:08.890> are<00:03:09.340> really

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
overall both of the displays are really

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.600 
overall both of the displays are really
nice<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.090> can't<00:03:10.630> for<00:03:11.530> us<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.130> five<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
nice you can't for us the five the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.870 
nice you can't for us the five the
retina<00:03:12.850> display<00:03:13.150> quality<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.380> great<00:03:14.880> really

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
retina display quality is great really

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.620

really<00:03:16.390> clear<00:03:16.750> crisp<00:03:17.820> resolution<00:03:18.820> can't<00:03:19.540> go

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
really clear crisp resolution can't go

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.970 
really clear crisp resolution can't go
wrong<00:03:19.780> with<00:03:19.989> either<00:03:20.019> one<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.739> course

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
wrong with either one but of course

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.530 
wrong with either one but of course
you've<00:03:21.160> got<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.489> greater<00:03:21.760> real<00:03:22.000> estate<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
you've got the greater real estate the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.840 
you've got the greater real estate the
extra<00:03:22.989> half<00:03:23.170> inch<00:03:23.440> screen<00:03:24.220> real<00:03:24.370> estate<00:03:24.459> with

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
i'm going to be doing a speed test

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.729 
i'm going to be doing a speed test
comparison<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.880> iphone<00:03:31.810> 5<00:03:32.110> against<00:03:32.590> the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
comparison of the iphone 5 against the

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.460

4s<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:34.299> upcoming<00:03:34.450> video<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.140> i<00:03:35.170> wanted<00:03:35.350> to

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
4s in an upcoming video but i wanted to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.800 
4s in an upcoming video but i wanted to
really<00:03:35.709> show<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.519> quick<00:03:36.820> comparison<00:03:37.150> of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
really show you a quick comparison of

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
really show you a quick comparison of
that<00:03:38.670> again<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.820> iphone<00:03:40.120> 5<00:03:40.390> has<00:03:40.690> got<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.080> a6

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
that again the iphone 5 has got the a6

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.250 
that again the iphone 5 has got the a6
processor<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.700> let's<00:03:43.600> do<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> quick

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
processor and let's do a quick

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.330 
processor and let's do a quick
comparison<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.459> speed<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.720> two<00:03:47.340> so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
comparison of the speed of the two so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.740 
comparison of the speed of the two so
let's<00:03:48.489> do<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.640> quick<00:03:48.850> comparison<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.630> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
let's do a quick comparison of the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.050 
let's do a quick comparison of the
weather<00:03:49.930> channel<00:03:50.350> app<00:03:50.670> launch<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.850> at<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
weather channel app launch it at the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.480 
weather channel app launch it at the
same<00:03:52.239> time

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.450 

again<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.450> iphone<00:03:58.900> 5<00:03:59.290> definitely<00:04:00.130> faster

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
again the iphone 5 definitely faster

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.940 
again the iphone 5 definitely faster
apple<00:04:01.090> says<00:04:01.360> it's<00:04:01.540> twice<00:04:01.810> as<00:04:01.840> fast<00:04:02.170> as<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.560> 4s

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
apple says it's twice as fast as the 4s

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.070 
apple says it's twice as fast as the 4s
it's<00:04:03.460> definitely<00:04:03.850> faster<00:04:04.390> don't<00:04:04.870> know<00:04:04.960> if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
it's definitely faster don't know if

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.110 
it's definitely faster don't know if
it's<00:04:05.230> twice<00:04:05.440> as<00:04:05.470> fast<00:04:05.830> I'm<00:04:06.550> doing<00:04:06.850> some<00:04:07.000> other

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
it's twice as fast I'm doing some other

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.970 
it's twice as fast I'm doing some other
tests<00:04:07.540> with<00:04:07.660> Safari<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.380> YouTube<00:04:08.740> and<00:04:08.890> some

tests with Safari and YouTube and some
other<00:04:09.100> applications<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.060> i'll<00:04:10.570> be<00:04:10.660> doing

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
other applications and i'll be doing

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.750 
other applications and i'll be doing
those<00:04:11.020> speed<00:04:11.380> tests<00:04:11.740> in<00:04:11.800> an<00:04:11.920> upcoming<00:04:12.070> video

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
those speed tests in an upcoming video

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.270 
those speed tests in an upcoming video
so<00:04:13.690> let's<00:04:13.810> take<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.990> quick<00:04:14.260> look<00:04:14.470> at<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.920> sim

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
so let's take a quick look at the sim

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.470 
so let's take a quick look at the sim
card<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.820> compare<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.600> two<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:18.480> quick

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
card and compare the two a quick

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.830 
card and compare the two a quick
comparison<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:20.050> the<00:04:20.200> sim<00:04:20.410> cards<00:04:21.480> on<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.630> right

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
comparison of the sim cards on the right

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.900 
comparison of the sim cards on the right
you've<00:04:23.020> got<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.230> iphone<00:04:23.710> 5<00:04:24.010> sim<00:04:24.280> card<00:04:24.520> on<00:04:24.700> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
you've got the iphone 5 sim card on the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.510 
you've got the iphone 5 sim card on the
left<00:04:25.150> you've<00:04:25.300> got<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.600> iphone<00:04:25.930> 4s<00:04:26.520> smaller

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
left you've got the iphone 4s smaller

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.560 
left you've got the iphone 4s smaller
yeah<00:04:27.970> micro<00:04:28.390> sim<00:04:29.220> versus<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.430> four<00:04:31.120> sm

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
yeah micro sim versus the four sm

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.440 
yeah micro sim versus the four sm
definitely<00:04:32.320> smaller<00:04:32.560> but<00:04:33.030> not<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.240> much

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
definitely smaller but not that much

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.240 
definitely smaller but not that much
smaller<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.080> there's<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.320> quick<00:04:35.530> comparison<00:04:35.740> of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
smaller so there's a quick comparison of

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.320 
smaller so there's a quick comparison of
the<00:04:36.340> sim<00:04:37.090> cards<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.950> iphone<00:04:39.430> 5<00:04:39.730> also<00:04:40.090> has<00:04:40.300> a

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the sim cards the iphone 5 also has a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.290 
the sim cards the iphone 5 also has a
LTE<00:04:41.140> transceiver<00:04:42.040> built<00:04:42.310> into<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:42.760> if<00:04:43.120> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
LTE transceiver built into it so if you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.260 
LTE transceiver built into it so if you
have<00:04:43.570> LTE<00:04:43.870> service<00:04:44.500> which<00:04:44.710> i<00:04:45.040> don't<00:04:45.160> have<00:04:45.700> AT&amp;T

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
have LTE service which i don't have AT&amp;T

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.290 
have LTE service which i don't have AT&amp;T
and<00:04:46.660> lt's<00:04:47.050> not<00:04:47.080> available<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.190> my<00:04:48.250> area<00:04:48.730> you

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
and lt's not available in my area you

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.530 
and lt's not available in my area you
would<00:04:49.540> have<00:04:49.750> LTE<00:04:50.590> service<00:04:51.250> but<00:04:52.000> i'm<00:04:52.240> just

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
would have LTE service but i'm just

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.750 
would have LTE service but i'm just
stuck<00:04:52.720> with<00:04:52.750> 4G<00:04:53.620> service<00:04:54.010> so<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.460> nice

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
stuck with 4G service so a nice

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.000 
stuck with 4G service so a nice
additional<00:04:55.450> feature<00:04:55.510> with<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.140> iphone<00:04:56.470> 5<00:04:56.740> is

additional feature with the iphone 5 is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.630 
additional feature with the iphone 5 is
the<00:04:57.130> LTE<00:04:57.430> service<00:04:57.960> hopefully<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.290> teal<00:04:59.740> AT&amp;T

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
the LTE service hopefully a teal AT&amp;T

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.800 
the LTE service hopefully a teal AT&amp;T
will<00:05:00.730> be<00:05:00.850> rolling<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.210> out<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.540> my<00:05:01.660> area<00:05:01.960> soon
