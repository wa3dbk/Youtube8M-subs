gameplay his two deaths they were both

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.580 
gameplay his two deaths they were both
off<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:12.689> no<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> first<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.320> wasn't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
off or actually no the first one wasn't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
off or actually no the first one wasn't
off<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.250> straight<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> second<00:01:15.450> death<00:01:15.630> was

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
off a straight but the second death was

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.200 
off a straight but the second death was
off<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.229> streak<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> guaranteed

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
off a streak that would have guaranteed

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
off a streak that would have guaranteed
him<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.700> 200-plus<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.360> been

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
him the 200-plus and it would have been

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.710 
him the 200-plus and it would have been
the<00:01:21.630> first<00:01:21.659> 200<00:01:22.350> plus<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> secondary<00:01:24.570> i

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the first 200 plus with a secondary i

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
the first 200 plus with a secondary i
believe<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> any<00:01:25.470> call<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> duty<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.090> would

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
believe in any call of duty so it would

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
believe in any call of duty so it would
have<00:01:27.330> been<00:01:27.420> absolutely<00:01:27.600> ridiculous<00:01:28.590> he's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
have been absolutely ridiculous he's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
have been absolutely ridiculous he's
still<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.820> probably<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
still going for it so you probably see a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.789 
still going for it so you probably see a
200<00:01:31.619> plus<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.520> soon<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.180> us<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.869> pistol

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
200 plus here soon from us with a pistol

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460 
200 plus here soon from us with a pistol
um<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.540> should<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.020> fun<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
um and that that should be really fun to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
um and that that should be really fun to
watch<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> map<00:01:38.640> plus<00:01:38.909> which

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
watch but this is on the map plus which

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
watch but this is on the map plus which
makes<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:39.900> interesting<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
makes it a little more interesting and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
makes it a little more interesting and
you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.939> good

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you know i think this is a really good

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.469 
you know i think this is a really good
map<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:44.009> game<00:01:44.549> place<00:01:44.790> especially<00:01:45.030> with

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
map to go for game place especially with

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
map to go for game place especially with
a<00:01:45.509> pistol<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.979> ranges<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> play<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a pistol as the ranges if you play it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
a pistol as the ranges if you play it
properly<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.439> stay<00:01:49.619> either<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> left

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
properly and stay either on the left

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
properly and stay either on the left
right<00:01:50.880> side<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> map<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.530> i<00:01:52.560> think

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
right side of the map you know i think

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.060 
right side of the map you know i think
you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.159> play<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.430> properly<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.619> fits<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
you can play it properly and it fits the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.819 
you can play it properly and it fits the
game<00:01:56.430> style<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> pistol<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
game style for a pistol and just it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.719 
game style for a pistol and just it
works<00:01:59.040> overall<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.939> perfectly<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> yeah

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
works overall just perfectly and so yeah

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
works overall just perfectly and so yeah

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
rushing constantly in the spawn that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.830 
rushing constantly in the spawn that
still<00:03:56.519> has<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.909> chance<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.330> die<00:03:57.599> because

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
getting hit but they still have the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.020 
getting hit but they still have the
chance<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.470> die<00:04:01.620> but<00:04:01.739> he's<00:04:01.950> still<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.459> gunning

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
chance to die but he's still out gunning

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.270 
chance to die but he's still out gunning
them<00:04:03.150> he<00:04:03.360> sees<00:04:03.629> them<00:04:03.810> before<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.920> he's<00:04:05.010> still

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
them he sees them before and he's still

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.580

able to kill him before and a lot of the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.679 
able to kill him before and a lot of the
reason<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.250> because<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.670> orbital<00:04:09.030> vsat<00:04:09.180> and

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
reason is because the orbital vsat and

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
of course he has the orbital vsat right

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.490 
of course he has the orbital vsat right
here<00:04:12.390> he<00:04:12.450> comes<00:04:12.810> up<00:04:12.930> behind<00:04:13.049> these<00:04:13.260> guys<00:04:13.409> and
