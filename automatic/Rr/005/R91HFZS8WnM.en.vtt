00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
turbo this in the process of getting it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.279 
turbo this in the process of getting it
ready<00:00:19.400> I<00:00:19.550> came<00:00:20.060> across<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.449> couple<00:00:20.840> of<00:00:20.990> things

ready I came across a couple of things

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.890 
ready I came across a couple of things
that<00:00:21.580> got<00:00:22.580> to<00:00:22.699> be<00:00:22.760> taken<00:00:23.090> care<00:00:23.330> of<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.660> don't

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
that got to be taken care of so I don't

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.400 
that got to be taken care of so I don't
destroy<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.350> engine<00:00:24.680> once<00:00:24.859> I'm<00:00:25.010> boosted

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
in the head studs in then we're going to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.140 
in the head studs in then we're going to
go<00:01:04.009> with<00:01:04.160> je<00:01:05.890> pistons<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.130> evil<00:01:07.909> rods<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:10.280> that

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
go with je pistons and evil rods so that

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.440 
go with je pistons and evil rods so that
only<00:01:11.299> needs<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.600> be<00:01:11.630> done<00:01:11.900> beforehand<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:13.610> took

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
only needs to be done beforehand I took

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.510 
only needs to be done beforehand I took
the<00:01:14.600> whole<00:01:14.750> head<00:01:14.930> apart<00:01:15.260> last<00:01:15.770> weekend<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.400> get

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
the whole head apart last weekend to get

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.780 
the whole head apart last weekend to get
an<00:01:16.640> idea<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.119> how<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.600> do<00:01:17.869> all<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.790> it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
an idea of how to do all this and it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.359 
an idea of how to do all this and it
went<00:01:20.030> back<00:01:20.119> together<00:01:20.390> really<00:01:20.810> good<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
went back together really good it's a

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.100 
went back together really good it's a
pretty<00:01:22.580> complicated<00:01:23.000> thing<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.689> do<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.350> I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
pretty complicated thing to do but I

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.230 
pretty complicated thing to do but I
didn't<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.229> any<00:01:27.380> trouble<00:01:27.530> with<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.180> I'm<00:01:29.180> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
didn't have any trouble with it I'm a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.469 
didn't have any trouble with it I'm a
little<00:01:29.329> more<00:01:29.750> cooling<00:01:30.229> with<00:01:30.439> automotive

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
little more cooling with automotive

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.870 
little more cooling with automotive
engine<00:01:32.479> mechanics<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.979> was<00:01:34.100> easier<00:01:34.549> for<00:01:34.640> me

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
engine mechanics so it was easier for me

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.800 
engine mechanics so it was easier for me
I<00:01:35.500> had<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.590> put<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.799> new<00:01:36.979> oil<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.790> new<00:01:38.210> seal<00:01:38.540> for

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
I had to put a new oil a new seal for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.390 
I had to put a new oil a new seal for
the<00:01:38.840> pan<00:01:39.140> right<00:01:39.409> here<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:39.740> cap<00:01:40.040> behind<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the pan right here this cap behind the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.480 
the pan right here this cap behind the
be<00:01:40.520> thick<00:01:40.729> stone<00:01:40.939> wood<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.329> was<00:01:41.450> leaking<00:01:41.810> oil

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
be thick stone wood that was leaking oil

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.850 
be thick stone wood that was leaking oil
so<00:01:43.490> there's<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.820> couple<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.270> things<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.659> I<00:01:45.079> had

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
so there's a couple of things that I had

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.810 
so there's a couple of things that I had
to<00:01:45.890> get<00:01:46.100> taken<00:01:46.340> care<00:01:46.460> of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
to get taken care of

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.240 
to get taken care of
I'm<00:01:47.000> already<00:01:47.299> mocked<00:01:48.290> up<00:01:48.530> respect<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.159> my

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
I'm already mocked up respect for my

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.960 
I'm already mocked up respect for my
intercooler<00:01:50.079> so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
intercooler so

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.750 
intercooler so
but<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:53.080> changed<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.530> alternator<00:01:53.980> belt<00:01:54.190> line

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
but it changed the alternator belt line

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.570 
but it changed the alternator belt line
was<00:01:54.940> squealing<00:01:55.210> real<00:01:55.510> loud<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:57.190> need<00:01:57.490> to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
was squealing real loud and I need to

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.270 
was squealing real loud and I need to
replace<00:01:57.940> we<00:01:58.840> have<00:01:59.020> no<00:01:59.260> air<00:01:59.530> conditioning<00:02:00.070> or

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
replace we have no air conditioning or

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.220 
replace we have no air conditioning or
power<00:02:00.490> steering<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.540> pretty<00:02:01.750> easy<00:02:02.020> to

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
power steering so this is pretty easy to

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.010 
power steering so this is pretty easy to
get<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:04.170> alternator<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:06.520> there<00:02:07.020> what

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
get to alternator is right there what

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.290 
get to alternator is right there what
you<00:02:08.050> want<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.410> do<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.910> twelve

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
you want to do there is a twelve

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.820 
you want to do there is a twelve
millimeter<00:02:10.509> bolt<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:13.930> here<00:02:14.170> my<00:02:14.350> fingers<00:02:14.710> on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
millimeter bolt right here my fingers on

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.350 
millimeter bolt right here my fingers on
top<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.340> twelve<00:02:15.610> millimeter<00:02:15.820> bolt<00:02:16.240> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
top of it twelve millimeter bolt you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.920 
top of it twelve millimeter bolt you
want<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.570> take<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.930> completely<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
want to take that completely out and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.750 
want to take that completely out and
then<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.380> want<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> take<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.890> wheel<00:02:21.070> off<00:02:21.310> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
then you want to take the wheel off and
