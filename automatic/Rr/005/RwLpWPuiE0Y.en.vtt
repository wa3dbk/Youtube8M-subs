00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
way but let's just say that they are

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.729 
way but let's just say that they are
spaced<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.239> sound<00:00:40.510> right<00:00:40.809> let's<00:00:41.380> begin<00:00:41.500> by

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
spaced to sound right let's begin by

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.410 
spaced to sound right let's begin by
telling<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.190> what<00:00:42.280> I'm<00:00:42.430> running<00:00:42.610> through<00:00:43.059> I'm

Vox AC 15 hand wired head and cabinet
and<00:00:51.040> I'm<00:00:51.550> plugged<00:00:51.969> straight<00:00:52.149> in<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:53.050> got<00:00:53.230> it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
and I'm plugged straight in and I got it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.930 
and I'm plugged straight in and I got it
a<00:00:53.410> little<00:00:53.590> bit<00:00:53.770> cranked<00:00:54.129> up<00:00:54.219> so<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.520> get<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
a little bit cranked up so you get a

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.520 
a little bit cranked up so you get a
little<00:00:55.329> bit<00:00:55.539> of<00:00:55.629> grind<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.140> little<00:00:56.350> bit<00:00:56.440> of

little bit of grind and a little bit of

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.020 
little bit of grind and a little bit of
clean<00:00:56.770> so<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.039> can<00:00:57.129> really<00:00:57.399> hear<00:00:57.700> how<00:00:57.879> these

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
clean so you can really hear how these

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.930 
clean so you can really hear how these
single<00:00:58.480> coil<00:00:58.690> pickups<00:00:59.110> sound<00:00:59.410> let's<00:01:00.160> begin<00:01:00.370> by

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
single coil pickups sound let's begin by

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:37.469 
single coil pickups sound let's begin by
hearing<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.840> bridge<00:01:02.079> pickup

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.700 

okay<00:01:38.479> let's<00:01:38.690> move<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.140> next<00:01:39.170> position

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
okay let's move to the next position

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.980 
okay let's move to the next position
which<00:01:39.890> would<00:01:40.160> be<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.520> bridge<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.690> middle

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
which would be the bridge and the middle

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.109 
which would be the bridge and the middle
position<00:01:42.440> where<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.100> get<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> lot<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> quack

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
position where you get a lot of quack

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.330 
position where you get a lot of quack
and<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.540> sounds<00:01:45.020> really<00:01:45.170> amazing<00:01:46.010> let's<00:01:46.190> take

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
and it sounds really amazing let's take

00:01:46.340 --> 00:02:19.229 
and it sounds really amazing let's take
a<00:01:46.369> listen

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.509 

a<00:02:20.439> great<00:02:21.439> way<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> judge<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> single-coil

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
a great way to judge a single-coil

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.039 
a great way to judge a single-coil
pickup<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:22.970> by<00:02:23.090> listening<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.750> middle

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
pickup is by listening to the middle

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.899 
pickup is by listening to the middle
pick<00:02:24.230> up<00:02:24.379> if<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.799> sounds<00:02:25.189> great<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.790> only

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
pick up if it sounds great it can only

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.030 
pick up if it sounds great it can only
complement<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.629> other<00:02:26.659> two<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.590> let's<00:02:27.829> take<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
complement the other two so let's take a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
complement the other two so let's take a
listen<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.879> middle<00:02:29.209> pickup<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:29.750> true

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
listen to the middle pickup of the true

00:02:29.900 --> 00:03:01.660 
listen to the middle pickup of the true
Velvet

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.460 

now<00:03:02.670> let's<00:03:02.850> move<00:03:03.030> over<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> sound<00:03:03.810> many

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
now let's move over to the sound many

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.320 
now let's move over to the sound many
guitar<00:03:04.890> players<00:03:04.920> who<00:03:05.370> play<00:03:05.580> strats<00:03:05.970> love

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
guitar players who play strats love

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.810 
guitar players who play strats love
which<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.930> both<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.890> middle<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.430> neck

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
which is both the middle and neck

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:47.390 
which is both the middle and neck
position

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.710 

finally<00:03:48.400> let's<00:03:48.580> move<00:03:48.730> over<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> fat

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
finally let's move over to the fat

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:27.760 

you

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.440 

No

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.610 

one<00:04:33.450> thing<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.660> should<00:04:33.720> mention<00:04:33.870> about<00:04:34.350> these

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
one thing I should mention about these

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.860 
one thing I should mention about these
true<00:04:34.950> Velvets<00:04:35.430> they<00:04:35.640> are<00:04:35.880> very<00:04:36.600> much<00:04:36.810> like

true Velvets they are very much like
strat<00:04:37.410> pickups<00:04:37.590> but<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.900> polarity<00:04:39.900> is

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
strat pickups but the polarity is

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470 
strat pickups but the polarity is
reversed<00:04:39.990> much<00:04:40.980> like<00:04:41.250> when<00:04:41.670> you<00:04:41.820> put<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> 5-way

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
reversed much like when you put a 5-way

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.540 
reversed much like when you put a 5-way
switch<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:43.230> in<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.730> standard<00:04:45.710> bridge<00:04:46.710> middle

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
switch so in the standard bridge middle

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.160 
switch so in the standard bridge middle
and<00:04:47.730> neck<00:04:47.940> positions<00:04:48.450> you're<00:04:48.570> gonna<00:04:48.660> get<00:04:48.870> hum

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
and neck positions you're gonna get hum

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.550 
and neck positions you're gonna get hum
so<00:04:50.010> I'll<00:04:50.220> demonstrate<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:54.230> but<00:04:55.230> if<00:04:55.320> when<00:04:55.470> you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
so I'll demonstrate that but if when you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.080 
so I'll demonstrate that but if when you
put<00:04:55.740> them<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:55.980> their<00:04:56.160> notch<00:04:56.370> positions<00:04:56.970> which

put them in their notch positions which

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.210 
put them in their notch positions which
be<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.240> two<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.690> four<00:04:57.900> positions<00:04:58.320> where<00:04:58.470> the
