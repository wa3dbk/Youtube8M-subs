00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello friends how are you wearing the 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.510
 time without entering the forum 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.850
 I've been going too far and we're going to see 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.290
 I'll explain how he prepared the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.290
 land to grow vegetables 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.930
 giants and ship from a preparation to 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.060
 three-year land to get to 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.829
 cultivate the fortress accidents I know that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.759
 it's time but good once you've 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.740
 taken as we say the wheel well then 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.330
 every year you are planting 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.330
 well I told you 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.250
 is 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.160
 is the land that I use that I have in 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.320
 I returned to earth a bit like brown 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.999
 llosa of good earth quite loose 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.760
 appointment 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.409
 so what I do is the first year of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.340
 try to improve the structure of the 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.450
 land 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.450
 how do i do it 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.040
 I take the plot on which I had sown 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.740
 the orchard 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.900
 not this year or next, but the 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.230
 next I like I've been doing 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 I'm already planting every year 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:15.980
 the first thing is to throw a green manure 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.980
 as you can see here in this plot 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.219
 here I have planted green pea is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.409
 a pretty vigorous plant and that 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.409
 he left a lot of plant material 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.069
 and here I have another cereal 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.329
 the green manure I'm going to wolf and planting 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.330
 intercalate what I mean with 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.210
 interleaved 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.320
 very easy 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.119
 and here is always going the cba grew and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 then when I was high more or 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.890
 less than 50 centimeters 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.970
 here what I did is to take seeds from 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 green pea I sowed them to the volley 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.800
 and then I passed the barley to the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 mower the good the brushcutter for 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.560
 understand us and then covered the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.610
 seeds that I had thrown today 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.519
 if you count among the barley you see 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.390
 to be doing a lot of 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.390
 green peas 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 you do not see it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.100
 and in the plot that the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.020
 of the pea I will do the opposite when 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 this has a height of 50 centimeters 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.240
 that the limp will catch barley the strip 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 trees later I'll get her out of this 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.920
 is what I get 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 the first thing in the video is discounted 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
 teaches I have taught you to the earth that 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.120
 there in my garden is a little land 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.910
 clayey and brown to this 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.250
 plot that I am preparing now 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.620
 to grow this year if you realize 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.010
 although it is the same huerta the land is 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.900
 the same looks 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.080
 I 'm in charge as here was good 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.630
 green 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.200
 it is discounted it is no longer brown clayey 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.450
 it's pretty fucking dark brown 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.230
 black because because of the amount of 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.230
 humus that we have 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.140
 Y 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.590
 you see 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.599
 and they also look 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 if I'm sure I get a 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.870
 heap 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.350
 earthworms our great allies 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.300
 well once the first year we have what 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.150
 we have dedicated to the green fertilizer we already have 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.700
 let's say the improved structure then 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.430
 I will prepare the land to cultivate 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.790
 the first giant vegetable that is the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 pumpkin 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.390
 how am I going to do it in two parts 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.049
 with a manure base I have here 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.049
 a lot of manure 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.940
 and greeting adding to the earth 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.960
 I'm going to take the wheelbarrows 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.180
 then I will extend it in the next step 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.390
 this for half the plot the other 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.480
 half 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.519
 must do with compost also with people 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.970
 to do this on the ground 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.130
 it is neither more nor less 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.710
 with vegetable matter especially with leaves 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.540
 branches were used as also used 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.190
 last year I have to pull the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.340
 crusher and well I do not have much 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.330
 time the leaves are going to break down 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.330
 pretty fast 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.080
 When you have all this prepared to plant 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:45.090
 here the giant pumpkin this year the year 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.180
 last since the green hand this year 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.630
 always the giant pumpkin and the year that 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.970
 comes 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.850
 I will have this floor with a very structure 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.890
 very very good and this is where I will put the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.580
 giant vegetables the tomatoes the 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.000
 eggplant peppers radishes 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.430
 turnips sunflower the good corn and others 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.560
 varieties 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.560
 when I put the giant vegetables 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.050
 in three months 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.270
 here I have the spiral that has the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.729
 cultivate last year this year could 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.729
 here watermelons and giant melons 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:33.060
 Well, this year, this is where the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.060
 giant pumpkin the big fruit 340 kilos 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.150
 this is where I will put the garden of 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.570
 Giant vegetables 6 account this apart 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.870
 that is super-fertilized is to look at the 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.320
 land 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.630
 and look at the earth this earth is so is 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.040
 black black black black i no longer work 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.090
 here is practically on land 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.690
 clayey in addition with a very 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.920
 soft and does not make you sound or harden 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.680
 or nothing just catch ed 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.830
 Well, I think that by February there is 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.250
 walking tractor will pass you very much 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.440
 hidden now this to break the time 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.510
 hard structure that fits and good 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.850
 we clean all this herbs and 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.710
 then here I will pay with the 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.290
 fertilizer that getting into 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:29.250
 preparing that takes a few months 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:32.290
 remember the manure low sand 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.580
 palomina ash because we are in 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.890
 winter and I have a wood stove 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.610
 because all the ash goes there you know that 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.710
 the ash 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.780
 but then we can change the ph of 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.360
 the earth and then we will give ourselves one day 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.439
 but our potassium amount also 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.439
 of many minerals 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.260
 I hope you liked it I will continue 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:56.009
 with my work and I'll be putting the 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.639
 advancements you carry 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.639
 see you later
