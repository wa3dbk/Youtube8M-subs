00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.000 
if you're in a country other than the US
specifically<00:00:19.540> one<00:00:19.750> that<00:00:19.960> uses<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.350> 50<00:00:20.890> Hertz

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
specifically one that uses the 50 Hertz

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.620 
specifically one that uses the 50 Hertz
standard<00:00:21.670> instead<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.240> 60<00:00:22.600> Hertz

standard for power and video you may
have<00:00:25.660> noticed<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.110> doing<00:00:26.410> video

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
have noticed that doing video

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.880 
have noticed that doing video
pass-through<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.700> your<00:00:27.940> xbox<00:00:28.210> one<00:00:28.770> results<00:00:29.770> in

judder<00:00:30.189> this<00:00:31.000> is<00:00:31.119> because<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.509> Xbox<00:00:32.020> one<00:00:32.349> is

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
judder this is because the Xbox one is

this<00:00:56.950> results<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.610> some<00:00:58.030> stutters<00:00:58.540> especially

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
this results in some stutters especially

this results in some stutters especially

across the field to see what's going on

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.280 
across the field to see what's going on
you<00:01:06.610> can<00:01:06.640> really<00:01:07.000> notice<00:01:07.330> this<00:01:07.659> shutter

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
you can really notice this shutter

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.789 
you can really notice this shutter
now<00:01:09.070> hopefully<00:01:09.640> Xbox<00:01:10.420> can<00:01:10.689> fix<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.290> with<00:01:11.350> a

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
now hopefully Xbox can fix this with a

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.370 
now hopefully Xbox can fix this with a
patch<00:01:12.310> later<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.210> would<00:01:13.360> either<00:01:13.600> update<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
patch later that would either update the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.770 
patch later that would either update the
framerate<00:01:14.650> so<00:01:15.189> that<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.790> step<00:01:16.210> up<00:01:16.420> rather

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
framerate so that it is a step up rather

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.219 
framerate so that it is a step up rather
than<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.049> step<00:01:17.290> down<00:01:17.530> or<00:01:18.329> making<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.450> X<00:01:19.719> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
than a step down or making the X the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.099 
than a step down or making the X the
output<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.159> Xbox<00:01:21.909> switch<00:01:22.359> to<00:01:22.630> 50<00:01:22.929> Hertz

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
output of the Xbox switch to 50 Hertz

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.580 
output of the Xbox switch to 50 Hertz
mode<00:01:23.499> when<00:01:24.310> using<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:25.030> snap<00:01:25.630> mode<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.439> show

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.209 
mode when using the snap mode to show
video<00:01:27.329> but<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.570> kind<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.289> think<00:01:29.499> this<00:01:29.619> isn't<00:01:30.069> a

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
video but I kind of think this isn't a

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.880 
video but I kind of think this isn't a
rectifiable<00:01:30.850> solution<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.079> real<00:01:32.350> solution

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
rectifiable solution the real solution

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.160 
rectifiable solution the real solution
would<00:01:33.039> be<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.280> pick<00:01:33.909> some<00:01:34.149> intermediary<00:01:34.719> frame

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
would be to pick some intermediary frame

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.459 
would be to pick some intermediary frame
range<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.649> run<00:01:35.799> at<00:01:36.009> or<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.329> do<00:01:37.509> some<00:01:37.960> very<00:01:38.170> fancy

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
range to run at or to do some very fancy

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.410 
range to run at or to do some very fancy
frame<00:01:39.009> interpolation<00:01:39.609> in<00:01:39.969> order<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.270> make

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
frame interpolation in order to make

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.989 
frame interpolation in order to make
everything<00:01:40.719> run<00:01:41.049> smoothly<00:01:41.469> but<00:01:42.280> 60<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.909> 50

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
everything run smoothly but 60 and 50

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.940 
everything run smoothly but 60 and 50
Hertz<00:01:43.359> are<00:01:43.539> kind<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:44.020> hard<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.740> with

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
Hertz are kind of hard to do that with

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.429 
Hertz are kind of hard to do that with
typically<00:01:45.460> what<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.819> do<00:01:45.999> is<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.539> change<00:01:47.049> the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
typically what you do is you change the

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.169 
typically what you do is you change the
frame<00:01:47.679> rate<00:01:47.740> for<00:01:48.340> one<00:01:48.520> or<00:01:48.639> the<00:01:48.670> other<00:01:48.880> and

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
frame rate for one or the other and

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.270 
frame rate for one or the other and
slowly<00:01:49.899> over<00:01:50.170> time<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:50.679> adjust<00:01:51.039> for<00:01:51.159> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
slowly over time and adjust for the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.160 
slowly over time and adjust for the
audio<00:01:51.609> well<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.689> do<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:53.049> with

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
audio well you can do that with

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.529 
audio well you can do that with
pre-recorded<00:01:53.469> stuff<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.549> very<00:01:54.999> hard<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.389> do

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
pre-recorded stuff it's very hard to do

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.050 
pre-recorded stuff it's very hard to do
with<00:01:55.689> live<00:01:55.929> broadcast<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:56.920> real<00:01:57.189> time<00:01:57.520> so

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
with live broadcast in real time so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.230 
with live broadcast in real time so
likely<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.649> video<00:02:00.219> pass-through<00:02:00.909> mode<00:02:00.939> on

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
likely this video pass-through mode on

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.419 
likely this video pass-through mode on
the<00:02:01.329> Xbox<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.990> only<00:02:02.259> going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.619> be<00:02:02.740> resolved<00:02:03.249> if

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
the Xbox is only going to be resolved if

the Xbox is only going to be resolved if

the frame rate of video games which

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
the frame rate of video games which
could<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> challenge<00:02:12.940> for<00:02:13.000> developers

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
could be a challenge for developers

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.570 
could be a challenge for developers
especially<00:02:13.990> since<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:14.800> won't<00:02:14.980> have<00:02:15.220> tested

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
especially since they won't have tested

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.699 
especially since they won't have tested
the<00:02:15.670> early<00:02:15.970> games<00:02:16.180> running<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.110> 50<00:02:17.440> Hertz

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the early games running in this 50 Hertz

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.800 
the early games running in this 50 Hertz
mode<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.850> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> make<00:02:19.330> development<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
mode this is going to make development a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.830 
mode this is going to make development a
little<00:02:19.959> bit<00:02:20.140> harder<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.540> Microsoft<00:02:22.540> is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
little bit harder and so Microsoft is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.770 
little bit harder and so Microsoft is
going<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.379> pick

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
going to have to pick

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.900 
going to have to pick
a<00:02:23.870> better<00:02:24.200> video<00:02:24.530> experience<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.370> better<00:02:25.640> game

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
a better video experience a better game

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.870 
a better video experience a better game
experience<00:02:26.410> or<00:02:27.410> basically<00:02:28.250> saying<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
experience or basically saying that the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.000 
experience or basically saying that the
video<00:02:29.120> pass-through<00:02:29.630> mode<00:02:29.690> doesn't<00:02:30.530> work<00:02:30.709> in

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
video pass-through mode doesn't work in

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.370 
video pass-through mode doesn't work in
PAL
