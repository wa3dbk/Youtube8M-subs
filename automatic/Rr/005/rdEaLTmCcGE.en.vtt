00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
in some extra buying points so we've had

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.600 
in some extra buying points so we've had
some<00:02:58.840> infrastructure<00:02:59.140> begin<00:02:59.830> we'd<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.400> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
some infrastructure begin we'd like to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.790 
some infrastructure begin we'd like to
see<00:03:00.790> maybe<00:03:01.510> even<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.870> shelling<00:03:02.110> plant<00:03:02.470> put<00:03:02.680> in

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
see maybe even a shelling plant put in

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.050 
see maybe even a shelling plant put in
in<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> future<00:03:03.340> not<00:03:03.580> only<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
in the future not only for the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
employment standpoint but it would would

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.620 
employment standpoint but it would would

give us some more stability to get the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.900 
give us some more stability to get the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
growers then to realize you not gonna

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.949
