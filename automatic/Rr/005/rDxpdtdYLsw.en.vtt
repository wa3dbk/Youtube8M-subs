really what it comes down to will this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.720 
really what it comes down to will this
treatment<00:00:12.660> work<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> what<00:00:14.400> will<00:00:14.549> my

patients and families who suffer from

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.269 
patients and families who suffer from
disease<00:00:20.310> has<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.480> driven<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
disease has really driven the way that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.450 
disease has really driven the way that
we<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.609> our<00:00:23.789> work<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.660> not<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.859> science

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
we do our work this is not just science

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.930 
we do our work this is not just science
this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> race<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> cure

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.450 

we're<00:00:36.450> finding<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.650> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
we're finding right now that the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460 
we're finding right now that the
understanding<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.300> life<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.840> taking<00:00:40.320> us<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
understanding of life is taking us to

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.979 
understanding of life is taking us to
where<00:00:41.010> each<00:00:41.370> patient<00:00:41.970> has<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.540> treated

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
where each patient has to be treated

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.440 
where each patient has to be treated
uniquely<00:00:43.620> individually<00:00:44.610> personalized

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
uniquely individually personalized

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.049 
uniquely individually personalized
medicine<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.530> guided<00:00:47.340> by<00:00:47.520> its<00:00:47.700> anomic

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
medicine that's guided by its anomic

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
medicine that's guided by its anomic
medicine<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.400> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
medicine is something that it's really a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.720 
medicine is something that it's really a
driver<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> 21st<00:00:51.690> century<00:00:52.110> science<00:00:52.730> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
driver for the 21st century science you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
driver for the 21st century science you
realize<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.960> workings<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.190> cell

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
realize that the workings of the cell

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
realize that the workings of the cell
when<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:56.790> don't<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.510> leads<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
when they don't work right leads to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
when they don't work right leads to
disease<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.519> does<00:00:59.820> become<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> factor

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
disease so then it does become a factor

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.960 
disease so then it does become a factor
of<00:01:00.930> wanting<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.800> understand<00:01:02.370> what's<00:01:02.580> going<00:01:02.879> on

of wanting to understand what's going on
with<00:01:03.180> patients<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> knowledge<00:01:05.670> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
with patients and how the knowledge that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
we gain from doing research can be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.210 
we gain from doing research can be
