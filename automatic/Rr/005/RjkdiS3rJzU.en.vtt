nice to meet you so what we are showing

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
nice to meet you so what we are showing
years<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.250> truly<00:00:20.490> wireless<00:00:21.090> display<00:00:21.270> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
years and truly wireless display that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
years and truly wireless display that
means<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> power<00:00:22.769> vileness<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
means that get the power vileness and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.450 
means that get the power vileness and
the<00:00:23.670> data<00:00:23.910> also<00:00:24.359> by<00:00:24.660> others<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> idea<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the data also by others so the idea is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.550 
the data also by others so the idea is
to<00:00:26.880> build<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.359> new<00:00:27.480> infrastructure<00:00:28.230> for

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
to build a new infrastructure for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.430 
to build a new infrastructure for
in<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.010> showcase<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:31.940> have<00:00:32.060> implemented<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
in this showcase we have implemented the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.490 
in this showcase we have implemented the
power<00:00:33.680> antenna<00:00:34.100> into<00:00:34.490> this<00:00:35.330> desk<00:00:35.630> -<00:00:36.290> it's

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
power antenna into this desk - it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.920 
power antenna into this desk - it's
called<00:00:36.740> a<00:00:36.980> smart<00:00:37.370> universal<00:00:38.060> power<00:00:38.510> antenna

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
called a smart universal power antenna

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.950 
called a smart universal power antenna
the<00:00:39.290> reason<00:00:39.680> smart<00:00:40.430> because<00:00:40.730> only<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.600> parts

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
the reason smart because only the parts

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.009 
the reason smart because only the parts
you<00:00:42.080> need<00:00:42.110> for<00:00:42.650> four

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.349 

the<00:00:47.019> Universalist<00:00:47.949> because<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:48.519> needs<00:00:49.120> more

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
the Universalist because it needs more

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.509 
the Universalist because it needs more
than<00:00:49.539> one<00:00:49.750> device<00:00:49.929> so<00:00:50.500> in<00:00:50.829> future<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:51.489> can

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
than one device so in future you can

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.419 
than one device so in future you can
power<00:00:51.999> limbs<00:00:52.449> or<00:00:52.809> this<00:00:53.140> place<00:00:53.440> or<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.250> also

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
power limbs or this place or you also

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.939 
power limbs or this place or you also
can<00:00:54.699> use<00:00:54.729> it<00:00:55.239> for<00:00:55.719> charging<00:00:55.929> for<00:00:56.440> example<00:00:56.829> your

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
can use it for charging for example your

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.179 
can use it for charging for example your
smartphone<00:00:57.579> or<00:00:57.879> your<00:00:57.940> your<00:00:58.449> notebook<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.589> not

smartphone or your your notebook and not

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.609 
smartphone or your your notebook and not
possible<00:01:00.430> today<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:01.030> can<00:01:01.449> little<00:01:02.019> bit<00:01:02.079> move

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
possible today you can little bit move

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.789 
possible today you can little bit move
around<00:01:02.920> here<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.369> a<00:01:03.460> certain<00:01:03.699> area<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
around here in a certain area and you

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.440 
around here in a certain area and you
can<00:01:05.979> also<00:01:06.189> turn<00:01:06.460> around<00:01:06.789> you<00:01:07.000> see<00:01:07.210> there<00:01:07.360> is

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
can also turn around you see there is

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.620 
can also turn around you see there is
absolutely<00:01:07.600> no<00:01:08.200> cable<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.030> at<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.179> moment<00:01:10.390> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
absolutely no cable so at the moment the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.050 
absolutely no cable so at the moment the
data<00:01:10.840> transfers<00:01:11.409> working<00:01:11.890> with<00:01:12.039> wireless<00:01:12.520> USB

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
data transfers working with wireless USB

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.559 
data transfers working with wireless USB
but<00:01:13.360> basically<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:15.220> same<00:01:15.490> as<00:01:15.759> wireless<00:01:16.270> LAN

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
but basically the same as wireless LAN

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.139 
but basically the same as wireless LAN
office<00:01:17.200> why<00:01:17.920> do<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:18.789> what

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
office why do I so this is what

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.020 
office why do I so this is what
basically<00:01:19.590> showcase<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.729> view<00:01:21.909> is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
basically showcase and this view is

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.029 
basically showcase and this view is
working<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.720> moment<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.500> how<00:01:23.709> long<00:01:23.920> do<00:01:24.009> you

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
working at the moment so how long do you

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.340 
working at the moment so how long do you
think<00:01:24.130> before<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:24.610> blink<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.539> show<00:01:25.869> highest

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
think before you blink so show highest

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.680 
think before you blink so show highest
level<00:01:26.709> and<00:01:26.830> become<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.270> co-product<00:01:28.270> so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
level and become a co-product so

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.999 
level and become a co-product so
basically<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:30.929> it's<00:01:31.929> a<00:01:32.049> really<00:01:32.380> solution

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
basically first it's a really solution

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.039 
basically first it's a really solution
so<00:01:33.250> it's<00:01:33.459> not<00:01:33.610> something<00:01:33.909> but<00:01:34.209> you<00:01:34.299> can<00:01:34.509> buy<00:01:35.020> a

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
so it's not something but you can buy a

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.109 
so it's not something but you can buy a
summer<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.850> superstore<00:01:37.450> yeah<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:39.130> my

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
summer the superstore yeah so my

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.990 
summer the superstore yeah so my
expectation<00:01:41.020> number<00:01:41.530> six<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.459> twelve<00:01:42.880> months

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
expectation number six to twelve months

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.770 
expectation number six to twelve months
at<00:01:43.479> least<00:01:43.509> have<00:01:44.350> really<00:01:45.000> first<00:01:46.000> demonstration

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
at least have really first demonstration

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.350 
at least have really first demonstration
yeah<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.319> because<00:01:48.190> his<00:01:48.550> infrastructure

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
yeah and because his infrastructure

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.690 
yeah and because his infrastructure
solution<00:01:49.929> be<00:01:50.019> fourth<00:01:50.319> really<00:01:50.739> goes<00:01:51.009> for<00:01:51.340> for

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
solution be fourth really goes for for

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.869 
solution be fourth really goes for for
the<00:01:51.789> muster<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.810> customers<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.739> expected<00:01:54.640> might

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:54.879 
the muster of customers I expected might

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.240 
the muster of customers I expected might
be<00:01:55.209> five<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.720> ten<00:01:55.929> years<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:56.649> because<00:01:57.009> it's

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
be five to ten years just because it's

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.310 
be five to ten years just because it's
you<00:01:58.670> need<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.360> have<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.690> infrastructure

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
you need to have the infrastructure

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.910 
you need to have the infrastructure
overall<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.110> could<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.290> somewhere<00:02:03.740> for

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
overall so could be somewhere for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.530 
overall so could be somewhere for
example<00:02:03.980> building<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.790> trains<00:02:05.150> or<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
example building a trains or the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.090 
example building a trains or the
airplanes<00:02:05.990> you'll<00:02:06.350> be<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.590> discussion
