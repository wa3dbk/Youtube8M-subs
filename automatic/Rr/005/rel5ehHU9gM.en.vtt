 video with you just like me before 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.240
 some time looking for the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.040
 perfect digital camera since and before 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 I now lose too many words and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 overwhelmed with information 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 necessarily click on the link or the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.630
 Video 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.000
 in the description there you will find 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 namely the current review all 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.789
 but also known above all with hire 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 flowers digital cameras from the year 2010 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.779
 the big manufacturer but also already 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.830
 for some new models from the year 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 2004 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.469
 because this is a best list the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.690
 updated daily so you are always 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.290
 stand up to date and can 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.579
 easily wants all minutes 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 digital camera models with each other 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.230
 Based on certain criteria you lost 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 compare itself determine 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.360
 Of course that was an hour long 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.610
 research and is really practical yes 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.789
 myself two weeks ago on the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.530
 looking for a new digital camera 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.619
 because my old one gave up the ghost 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 After two years of intensive use what 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 then, of course, the rates were annoying 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.400
 this is the warranty period 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 expired 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.939
 Meanwhile, the development is on the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.909
 electronics market that's fast 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.409
 every two years would be a digital camera 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.100
 anyway no longer he stood time 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 Read I always quite good 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.759
 I sit there too, but I'm super 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.290
 shoot and I can get it on then 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.430
 the search is done online because I have the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.070
 cheapest price 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.780
 because as we all know 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.159
 Electrician locate place frying 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
 but are usually 20 to 30 percent 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.369
 accordingly, that can not hold me 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 in question even if these possibilities 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.259
 because they are using an online shop 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.299
 Of course, no need to do that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.970
 probably a actions customers to 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.820
 is the online shops like Amazon so good 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.610
 prices can then turn to the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 search and I was shocked like 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.409
 many digital models is now 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.420
 and I just do not have it that way 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.950
 per hour I 've counted 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.079
 simply in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 the practical thing found and indeed 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.830
 simply a digital camera is a whole 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.870
 simple table 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.000
 There you can see all popular models 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.160
 The ones currently on the market are special 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 this demand can be strong 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.030
 just look at every barrier 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 which model could be in question 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.510
 I need in these properties can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 I omit properties and thus 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.099
 maybe to push the price and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 fits this camera at all in mine 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.700
 Of course, budget are just a few 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.799
 basic points 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.040
 but if you have more information 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.019
 possible and the latest review for 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 digital cameras then necessarily clicks on 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.860
 the link below the video in the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.459
 description will be in any case
