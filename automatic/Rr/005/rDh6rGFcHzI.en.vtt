really I pursue it a little bit but not
that<00:02:57.489> much<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.200> waves<00:02:59.530> there<00:03:00.400> were<00:03:00.609> more

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that much so the waves there were more

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.490 
that much so the waves there were more

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
I did sleep with my hair like this and

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.349 
I did sleep with my hair like this and
wrap<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.609> put<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.389> bonnet<00:03:11.169> on<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.349> just<00:03:12.359> slept

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
wrap it and put a bonnet on I just slept

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.640 
wrap it and put a bonnet on I just slept
in<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.280> basically<00:03:15.280> um<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.630> there<00:03:16.959> were<00:03:17.200> some

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
in it basically um so there were some

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
in it basically um so there were some
more<00:03:17.859> waves<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.489> like<00:03:18.669> I<00:03:18.790> slept<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.209> them<00:03:19.389> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
more waves but like I slept in them so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.599 
more waves but like I slept in them so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410

it<00:04:57.919> below<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:59.810> was<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.710> do<00:05:01.280> believe<00:05:01.789> it's<00:05:02.120> only

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it below it was I do believe it's only

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.969 
it below it was I do believe it's only
the<00:05:02.780> two<00:05:02.990> bundles<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.530> were<00:05:03.710> shedding

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
the two bundles that were shedding

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.879 
the two bundles that were shedding
because<00:05:04.310> originally<00:05:04.990> when<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.020> was<00:05:06.410> when<00:05:06.860> I

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
because originally when I was when I

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.270 
because originally when I was when I
first<00:05:07.280> got<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:08.380> when<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.440> first<00:05:09.680> got<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:10.070> hair

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
first got the when I first got the hair

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.659 
first got the when I first got the hair
it<00:05:10.520> was<00:05:10.610> only<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.210> two<00:05:11.389> bundles<00:05:11.750> are

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
it was only the two bundles are

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.360 
it was only the two bundles are
and<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.850> other<00:05:13.970> ones<00:05:14.270> were<00:05:14.570> chatting<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:16.340> I

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
and the other ones were chatting so I

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.490 
and the other ones were chatting so I
can't<00:05:16.820> believe<00:05:16.940> it's<00:05:17.240> only<00:05:17.389> those<00:05:17.720> tangling

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
can't believe it's only those tangling

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.650 
can't believe it's only those tangling
is<00:05:18.710> pretty<00:05:19.010> good<00:05:19.660> it's<00:05:20.660> pretty<00:05:20.930> minimal<00:05:22.660> it's

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
is pretty good it's pretty minimal it's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.409 
is pretty good it's pretty minimal it's
going<00:05:24.590> through<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:25.130> mean<00:05:25.310> it's<00:05:25.550> way<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.910> air<00:05:26.060> so

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
going through I mean it's way the air so

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.450 
going through I mean it's way the air so
it's<00:05:26.990> waiting<00:05:27.349> 30<00:05:27.590> inch<00:05:27.770> hair<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.280> there's

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
it's waiting 30 inch hair so there's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.270 
it's waiting 30 inch hair so there's
going<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.760> be<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.880> little<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.450> tinkling

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
going to be a little bit of tinkling

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.820 
going to be a little bit of tinkling
it's<00:05:31.280> definitely<00:05:31.520> not<00:05:32.000> as<00:05:32.389> much<00:05:33.020> as<00:05:34.570> before

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
it's definitely not as much as before

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.600 
it's definitely not as much as before
especially<00:05:36.830> because<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.460> um<00:05:39.039> wavy<00:05:40.039> I<00:05:40.250> would

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
especially because it is um wavy I would

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.750 
especially because it is um wavy I would
think<00:05:40.729> it<00:05:40.880> would<00:05:40.970> be<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> little<00:05:41.389> more<00:05:42.760> possibly

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
think it would be a little more possibly

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.839 
think it would be a little more possibly
like<00:05:44.180> tingly<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.020> guess<00:05:45.380> or<00:05:45.620> whatever<00:05:46.039> on<00:05:46.789> the

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
like tingly I guess or whatever on the

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:52.719 
like tingly I guess or whatever on the
hair<00:05:47.270> soft<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:49.400> ends<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.270> feel<00:05:50.630> like<00:05:51.520> ends<00:05:52.520> are

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729
