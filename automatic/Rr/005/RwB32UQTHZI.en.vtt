00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
make million dollars just by focusing on

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.960 
make million dollars just by focusing on
the<00:02:24.050> frameworks<00:02:24.500> alone<00:02:24.800> okay

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
the frameworks alone okay

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.500 
the frameworks alone okay
and<00:02:27.250> frameworks<00:02:28.250> are<00:02:28.340> awesome<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and frameworks are awesome now the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.890 
and frameworks are awesome now the
problem<00:02:30.410> with<00:02:31.010> frameworks<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.510> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
problem with frameworks is that it it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
problem with frameworks is that it it
limits<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.920> puts<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.910> damper<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.690> limits<00:02:36.290> your

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
limits it puts a damper or a limits your

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.560 
limits it puts a damper or a limits your

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
because with the emergence of frameworks

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.660 
because with the emergence of frameworks
a<00:02:47.990> lot<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.530> people<00:02:48.770> today<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.250> are<00:02:49.310> starting

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
a lot of people today that are starting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.840 
a lot of people today that are starting
out<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.790> web<00:02:50.030> design<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.830> tend<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.430> start

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
out in web design you tend to not start

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.830 
out in web design you tend to not start
from<00:02:53.120> Ground<00:02:53.660> Zero<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.640> where<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.450> really

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
from Ground Zero and where you really

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.140 
from Ground Zero and where you really
should<00:02:57.350> learn<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.800> basics<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.310> HTML<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:59.000> CSS

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150

stuff that's what that that's a problem

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.690 
stuff that's what that that's a problem
that<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.140> see<00:03:12.200> with<00:03:12.440> frameworks<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:13.490> when<00:03:13.670> I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
that I see with frameworks like when I

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.390 
that I see with frameworks like when I
got<00:03:13.940> started<00:03:14.290> there<00:03:15.290> was<00:03:15.440> no<00:03:15.590> frameworks<00:03:16.130> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
got started there was no frameworks and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.270 
got started there was no frameworks and
so<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> had<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.360> learn<00:03:17.600> basic<00:03:17.840> HTML<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.680> had<00:03:19.070> to

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
so I had to learn basic HTML I had to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.000 
so I had to learn basic HTML I had to
learn<00:03:19.460> code<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:19.940> had<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.450> use<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.410> was<00:03:21.620> using<00:03:21.830> a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
learn code I had to use I was using a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.800 
learn code I had to use I was using a
wig<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.220> WYSIWYG<00:03:22.790> when<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.030> first<00:03:23.300> started<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
wig of WYSIWYG when I first started and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.050 
wig of WYSIWYG when I first started and
I<00:03:24.140> would<00:03:24.290> view<00:03:24.470> source<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.040> see<00:03:25.220> how<00:03:25.460> things

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
I would view source and see how things

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.390 
I would view source and see how things
are<00:03:26.210> placed<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.750> screen<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.500> what

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
are placed on the screen and and what

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.370 
are placed on the screen and and what
the<00:03:28.490> code<00:03:28.670> was<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.360> became<00:03:29.900> familiar<00:03:30.080> with

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
the code was so I became familiar with

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.020 
the code was so I became familiar with
placing<00:03:30.830> things<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.400> became<00:03:31.820> familiar

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
placing things and I became familiar

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.270 
placing things and I became familiar
with<00:03:32.270> building<00:03:32.750> UI<00:03:32.960> design<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:33.860> growing

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
with building UI design and and growing

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.820 
with building UI design and and growing
my<00:03:34.490> UI<00:03:34.760> design<00:03:35.180> abilities<00:03:35.750> whereas<00:03:36.530> with

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
my UI design abilities whereas with

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.890 
my UI design abilities whereas with
frameworks<00:03:37.340> today<00:03:37.670> all<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.510> stuff<00:03:38.720> is

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
frameworks today all that stuff is

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.110 
frameworks today all that stuff is
pre-built<00:03:39.350> for<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.130> what<00:03:40.580> happens<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.090> a

pre-built for you and what happens is a
lot<00:03:41.210> of<00:03:41.360> people<00:03:41.750> will<00:03:42.020> take<00:03:42.290> these<00:03:42.620> frameworks

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
lot of people will take these frameworks

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.940 
lot of people will take these frameworks
and<00:03:43.459> they<00:03:44.330> won't<00:03:44.750> be<00:03:45.110> creative<00:03:45.590> enough<00:03:45.680> or

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
and they won't be creative enough or

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.280 
and they won't be creative enough or
they<00:03:46.040> don't<00:03:46.100> won't<00:03:46.280> evolve<00:03:46.820> from<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.840> basic

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
they don't won't evolve from the basic

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.990 
they don't won't evolve from the basic
default<00:03:48.470> template<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.190> they<00:03:49.340> give<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.790> and
