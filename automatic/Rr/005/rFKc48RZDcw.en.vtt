previous<00:01:53.310> called<00:01:53.460> 30<00:01:53.610> games<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
previous called 30 games but it's a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
previous called 30 games but it's a
little<00:01:54.659> bit<00:01:54.869> different<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> year<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
little bit different this year it's a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
little bit different this year it's a
little<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.490> difficult<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.509> how

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
little bit more difficult because of how

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
little bit more difficult because of how
different<00:01:58.229> advanced<00:01:58.740> warfare<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.430> played

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
different advanced warfare is played

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
different advanced warfare is played
with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> addition<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> exosuit<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
with the addition of the exosuit it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.880 
with the addition of the exosuit it
makes<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.210> those<00:02:03.390> previous<00:02:03.869> maps<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
makes a lot of those previous maps just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
makes a lot of those previous maps just
kind<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.250> unplayable<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.299> were<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
kind of like unplayable if they were in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
kind of like unplayable if they were in
this<00:02:06.750> game<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.350> about<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.829> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
this game like think about a really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639 
this game like think about a really
really<00:02:08.459> popular<00:02:08.729> map<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.300> black<00:02:09.509> ops<00:02:09.690> 2<00:02:10.020> with

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
really popular map on black ops 2 with

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.050 
really popular map on black ops 2 with
slums<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.400> everybody<00:02:11.910> loved<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.450> map

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
slums like everybody loved that map

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.640 
slums like everybody loved that map
for<00:02:13.239> competitive<00:02:13.660> great<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.050> pubs<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.470> was

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
for competitive great for pubs it was

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.380 
for competitive great for pubs it was
just<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> really<00:02:15.280> really<00:02:15.489> good<00:02:15.700> map<00:02:15.940> but

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
just it was a really really good map but

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.000 
just it was a really really good map but
think<00:02:16.630> about<00:02:16.720> playing<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.319> in<00:02:17.500> advanced

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
think about playing that in advanced

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.550 
think about playing that in advanced
warfare<00:02:18.520> there's<00:02:19.060> literally<00:02:19.450> nowhere<00:02:20.140> to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
warfare there's literally nowhere to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
warfare there's literally nowhere to
hide<00:02:20.770> because<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.400> pretty<00:02:21.670> much<00:02:21.819> just<00:02:21.880> kind

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
hide because it's pretty much just kind

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.460 
hide because it's pretty much just kind
of<00:02:22.239> flat<00:02:22.480> land<00:02:22.510> sometimes<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.440> like

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
of flat land sometimes you have like

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.199 
of flat land sometimes you have like
single-story<00:02:24.099> walls<00:02:24.340> people<00:02:25.000> could<00:02:25.120> be

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
single-story walls people could be

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.940 
single-story walls people could be
jumping<00:02:25.660> over<00:02:25.930> those<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.290> exosuits

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
jumping over those with exosuits

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.100 
jumping over those with exosuits
extremely<00:02:27.550> extremely<00:02:27.849> easily<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.870> can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
extremely extremely easily and you can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.330 
extremely extremely easily and you can
get<00:02:29.200> from<00:02:29.380> one<00:02:29.590> side<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> map<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
get from one side of the map to the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.160 
get from one side of the map to the
other<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.700> literally<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.660> two<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> half

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
other and literally like two and a half

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.960 
other and literally like two and a half
seconds<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.709> would<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.160> be<00:02:33.340> absolutely<00:02:33.790> not

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
seconds it would just be absolutely not

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.120 
seconds it would just be absolutely not
so<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> lot<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.720> old<00:02:34.900> maps<00:02:35.200> aren't<00:02:35.739> really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
so a lot of the old maps aren't really

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.729 
so a lot of the old maps aren't really
playable<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.000> game<00:02:37.269> because<00:02:37.930> they<00:02:38.410> they

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
playable in this game because they they

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.320 
playable in this game because they they
like<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.190> easy<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> around<00:02:39.849> with<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
like to easy to get around with the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330 
like to easy to get around with the
exosuit<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.230> kind<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.650> have<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.830> think<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
exosuit so you kind of have to think a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.070 
exosuit so you kind of have to think a
little<00:02:42.790> bit<00:02:42.970> more<00:02:43.120> careful<00:02:43.450> about<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:43.870> maps

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
little bit more careful about what maps

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.840 
little bit more careful about what maps
would<00:02:44.260> actually<00:02:44.650> make<00:02:44.769> sense<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.280> that's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
would actually make sense so that's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.759 
would actually make sense so that's
where<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.239> guys<00:02:46.390> come<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.810> actually<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.290> put

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
where you guys come in actually I put

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.199 
where you guys come in actually I put
together<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.130> poll<00:02:48.489> there's<00:02:48.730> gonna<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.030> link

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
trying to think of some good ones that

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.800

they<00:03:15.069> could<00:03:15.489> bring<00:03:15.610> back<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.599> just<00:03:16.720> like

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
they could bring back and it's just like

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.870 
they could bring back and it's just like
with<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> addition<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.160> exosuit<00:03:18.700> it's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.819 
with the addition of the exosuit it's
kind<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.090> hard<00:03:19.299> like<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.510> think<00:03:19.900> favela<00:03:20.320> would

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
kind of hard like I think favela would

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.440 
kind of hard like I think favela would
be<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> lot<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.340> fun<00:03:21.670> if<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.090> thing<00:03:22.120> was

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
be a lot of fun if that thing was

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.490 
be a lot of fun if that thing was
brought<00:03:22.630> back<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.079> it's<00:03:23.170> already<00:03:23.320> been

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
brought back but it's already been

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.750 
brought back but it's already been
brought<00:03:23.650> back<00:03:23.829> one<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.310> don't<00:03:24.489> know<00:03:24.549> if<00:03:24.640> they

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
