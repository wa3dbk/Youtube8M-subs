00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.720
 I was in favor with the minister 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.229
 tutors and trainers who do a job 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.960
 to accompany the teachers 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.530

 we accompany the teachers and 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.740
 sometimes we have a people 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.899
 they think the teachers think we 're 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
 supervising but that's not the work and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 we do a job of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.630
 accompaniment we learn from the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.660
 teachers' experiences because they are 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.970
 very important and at the same time we can 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.980
 compare with the experience that already 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.260
