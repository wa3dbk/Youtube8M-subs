00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.019
 Franconia 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.309
 I would die 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.309
 trivial 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.160
 Dublin the 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.760
 more 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.100
 Aachen Valentino in the end 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.550

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.990
 eat 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 continue 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.320
 on 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 Whistler 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.260
 who will retreat quickly 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 and I want all my groups 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 t 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 the speech 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.060
 she shouted loudly or shovel and pimple 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.120
 because it was exactly 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.610
 one puts 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 then 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.850
 but my god the points on the connecting goal 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.710
 Fuck the dots I'm still 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.880
 Bronze with wreath woodland shovel 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 and with him the show 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.220
 on 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 definitely not 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.310
 Yahoo was how high was 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 so take care of how can 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 Be Boubacar 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.769
 No, the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.019
 I have understood 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.019
 Bonn 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 what rules 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 Red 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.289
 I 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.289
 almost excluded Red 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.979
 and because 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.369
 St 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.369
 flow 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.359
 now lies 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.209
 December 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 suddenly should 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.819
 the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 Voerde 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.620
 who she is 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.620
 in normal 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.869
 Ehrhardt 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.999
 gave her that 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 good and am 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.029
 the whole way back 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.029
 was upset 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.539
 no problem 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.539
 on 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.449
 and now 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.789
 Now not only can very little space to build logical or 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.529
 that's so 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.680
 the discharge Whistler he knows I now snickered hopefully hope 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.780
 that it is not so bad Wissmann if you so scoff under sentence 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.150
 thats expensive 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.559
 Whistler 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.559
 I think you have already decided the whole country 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.479
 install this 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.629
 is 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:41.949
 where 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.599
 no Here 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.409
 St 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.099
 he has 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.099
 Whistler 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.580
 they are going to a market 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.120
 and that's not a little APA 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.620
 the so Richer Vorstopper 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.990
 how little you are can swallow as much and almost always in Rome 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.710
 the word 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.710
 Dorsten 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.300
 the EU 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.770
 ranked Heldt 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.169
 other mall get old 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.419
 d 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.129
 my people 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.270
 Looser give 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.509
 "Hey Mr 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.710
 No 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.830
 it has been possible 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.999
 first he had also granted seamlessly long journey nothing 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.939
 the 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.309
 SK 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.499
 unfortunately 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.499
 there we will want or and left off 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.770
 Not 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.740
 4 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.860
 on 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.860
 that that should not happen 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.580
 How many people will then be submerged 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.880
 Not 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.860
 the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.249
 the on 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.300
 I do not believe that I believed 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.300
 I think you start stuttering though 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.020
 around 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.949
 the table will be struck to stop being struck 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.949
 we should continue first 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.869
 Wait a while to see if you can not even continue 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.779
 from St 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.210
 but good 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.140
 not included with the numbers
