00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 but that depends on black 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.999
 Rainer Adrion 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.999
 District Administrator Matthias Wilkes 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 like the Statistical Office 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 he already manages with dealers in the market 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.660
 a car radio 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 that could have their customers around the world 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 surprisingly strong 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.660
 with the hour-long girls and boys hit a stop 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.580
 out 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.260
 here 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 maybe I will 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 returned 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 negative pressure 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 that is not yet clear his sympathy 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 become the hesse and baden-wÃ¼rttemberg 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 You can bet on that 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.109
 Yes I know 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.109
 but not always Hans Klok Rock 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.909
 expensive 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.909
 Rheine 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 that she does not yet 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.299
 but a rendezvous 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 Deuce 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.889
 No 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.889
 Muenster 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 DuPont 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.219
 maybe interested 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.469
 in the 10 he could 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.469
 not by a public 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.039
 just in between 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.239
 so that's the other one 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.509
 I will have to come yet
