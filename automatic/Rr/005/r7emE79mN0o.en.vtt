00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
to show you how to build a beyblade with

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.080 
to show you how to build a beyblade with
two<00:00:08.960> metal<00:00:09.740> wheels<00:00:10.070> like<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:10.730> one<00:00:10.850> you<00:00:10.940> see

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
two metal wheels like the one you see

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.540 
two metal wheels like the one you see
here<00:00:11.380> pretty<00:00:12.380> much<00:00:12.470> all<00:00:12.680> I<00:00:12.740> did<00:00:13.040> to<00:00:13.190> build<00:00:13.370> this

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
here pretty much all I did to build this

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.209 
here pretty much all I did to build this
was<00:00:14.090> I<00:00:14.510> went<00:00:14.720> to<00:00:14.780> a<00:00:14.870> local<00:00:15.080> hardware<00:00:15.380> store<00:00:16.039> and

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
was I went to a local hardware store and

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.939 
was I went to a local hardware store and
found<00:00:16.880> a<00:00:17.089> special<00:00:17.570> screw<00:00:17.960> well<00:00:18.560> not<00:00:18.830> really

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
found a special screw well not really

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.069 
found a special screw well not really
special<00:00:19.310> it's<00:00:19.429> a<00:00:19.640> normal<00:00:19.849> type<00:00:19.999> of<00:00:20.119> screw<00:00:20.329> that

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.079 
special it's a normal type of screw that

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.019 
special it's a normal type of screw that
looked<00:00:21.349> like<00:00:21.410> a<00:00:21.499> big<00:00:21.890> label<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.669> had<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.909> same

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
looked like a big label it had the same

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.329 
looked like a big label it had the same
width<00:00:23.390> as<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:24.230> just<00:00:24.499> bring<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.800> face<00:00:24.980> bolt<00:00:25.189> with

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
width as it just bring a face bolt with

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.589 
width as it just bring a face bolt with
you<00:00:25.490> when<00:00:25.609> you<00:00:25.699> go<00:00:25.759> to<00:00:25.789> your<00:00:25.999> hardware<00:00:26.239> store

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
you when you go to your hardware store

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.269 
you when you go to your hardware store
and<00:00:26.659> compare<00:00:26.989> them<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.289> ones<00:00:27.380> there<00:00:27.679> the

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
and compare them to the ones there the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.919 
and compare them to the ones there the
hex<00:00:28.550> on<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.880> top<00:00:29.089> is<00:00:29.269> going<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.539> be<00:00:29.689> a<00:00:29.720> little

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
hex on the top is going to be a little

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.929 
hex on the top is going to be a little
bit<00:00:30.140> smaller<00:00:30.499> than<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.099> average<00:00:31.279> beyblade

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
bit smaller than the average beyblade

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.220 
bit smaller than the average beyblade
face<00:00:32.149> bolt<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.629> you<00:00:32.719> have<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.930> use<00:00:33.079> your

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
face bolt so you have to use your

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.990 
face bolt so you have to use your
fingers<00:00:33.649> either<00:00:33.920> your<00:00:34.190> fingers<00:00:34.489> describe<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
fingers either your fingers describe it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.939 
fingers either your fingers describe it
in<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.239> unscrew<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:35.660> or<00:00:35.870> if<00:00:36.559> you<00:00:36.739> have<00:00:36.829> the

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
in and unscrew it or if you have the

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.290 
in and unscrew it or if you have the
right<00:00:37.100> sized<00:00:37.340> wrench<00:00:37.730> just<00:00:38.030> go<00:00:38.120> out<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.239> your

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
right sized wrench just go out to your

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.389 
right sized wrench just go out to your
grout<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.870> grab<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.379> wrench<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.890> use<00:00:40.280> it

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
grout and grab the wrench and use it

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.349 
grout and grab the wrench and use it
that<00:00:40.550> way<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.590> for<00:00:42.590> example<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.190> put<00:00:43.489> stud<00:00:44.030> or<00:00:44.239> I

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
that way so for example I put stud or I

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.270 
that way so for example I put stud or I
put<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.690> Sagittario<00:00:45.170> energy<00:00:45.590> ring<00:00:45.739> on<00:00:45.890> basalt

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
put the Sagittario energy ring on basalt

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.939 
put the Sagittario energy ring on basalt
and<00:00:46.579> basalt<00:00:46.969> on<00:00:47.149> top<00:00:47.300> of<00:00:47.420> Skype<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.800> works

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
and basalt on top of Skype and it works

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.680 
and basalt on top of Skype and it works
with<00:00:49.070> any<00:00:49.219> spin<00:00:49.460> track<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.760> any<00:00:49.879> tip<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.390> just

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
with any spin track in any tip it just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.119 
with any spin track in any tip it just
acts<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.079> normal<00:00:51.350> face<00:00:51.530> bolt<00:00:51.739> I'll<00:00:52.010> go

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
acts like a normal face bolt I'll go

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.520 
acts like a normal face bolt I'll go
ahead<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.370> unscrew<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.179> show<00:00:54.109> you<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
ahead and unscrew this to show you the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.860 
ahead and unscrew this to show you the
size<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.980> screw<00:00:55.309> one<00:00:55.489> more<00:00:55.609> time<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.210> show

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
size of the screw one more time and show

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.789 
size of the screw one more time and show
you<00:00:56.929> that<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.140> actually<00:00:57.289> works

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.810 

we<00:01:06.430> go<00:01:06.549> here's<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.000> face<00:01:07.299> one<00:01:07.689> more<00:01:07.719> time<00:01:07.840> just

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
we go here's the face one more time just

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.429 
we go here's the face one more time just
for<00:01:09.820> an<00:01:09.880> example<00:01:09.969> you<00:01:10.329> can<00:01:10.390> take<00:01:10.719> a<00:01:10.780> picture<00:01:11.049> of

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
for an example you can take a picture of

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.590 
for an example you can take a picture of
the<00:01:11.799> screen<00:01:12.039> and<00:01:12.429> take<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.359> hardware

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
the screen and take it to the hardware

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.060 
the screen and take it to the hardware
store<00:01:13.659> with<00:01:13.929> you<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.140> compare<00:01:14.469> or<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.950> just

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
store with you to compare or you just

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.190 
store with you to compare or you just
bring<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.310> off<00:01:15.579> beyblade<00:01:16.119> face<00:01:16.390> face<00:01:16.840> bolt<00:01:17.049> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
bring it off beyblade face face bolt to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.819 
bring it off beyblade face face bolt to
compare<00:01:17.500> with<00:01:17.649> also<00:01:18.600> energy<00:01:19.600> ring<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:19.899> as<00:01:20.710> you

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
compare with also energy ring and as you

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.350 
compare with also energy ring and as you
see<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.219> just<00:01:21.399> stack<00:01:21.640> them<00:01:21.850> on<00:01:21.939> top<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.270> each

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
see I just stack them on top of each

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.050 
see I just stack them on top of each
other<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.130> lines<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.460> inside<00:01:24.490> don't<00:01:24.939> have

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
other the lines on the inside don't have

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.249 
other the lines on the inside don't have
to<00:01:25.119> be<00:01:25.209> matched<00:01:25.390> they<00:01:25.719> can<00:01:25.869> be<00:01:25.959> in<00:01:26.079> any

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
to be matched they can be in any

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.929 
to be matched they can be in any
position<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:27.009> I'll<00:01:27.069> still<00:01:27.310> screw<00:01:27.549> in<00:01:27.670> okay

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
position and I'll still screw in okay

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.449 
position and I'll still screw in okay
that<00:01:28.479> way<00:01:28.569> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.959> align<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.009> spiral

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
that way you can align the spiral

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.100 
that way you can align the spiral
staircase<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:31.060> death<00:01:31.270> accordingly<00:01:31.750> if<00:01:31.929> you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
staircase of death accordingly if you

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.309 
staircase of death accordingly if you
use<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.679> salt<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.780> almost<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.869> crack<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.170> tip

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
use the salt and almost a crack and tip

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.679 
use the salt and almost a crack and tip
this<00:01:35.649> works<00:01:35.829> like<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.520> then<00:01:36.689> preview

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
this works like that and then preview

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.839 
this works like that and then preview
that<00:01:37.989> it<00:01:38.079> actually<00:01:38.380> builds<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.099> isn't<00:01:39.640> loose

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
that it actually builds and isn't loose

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.020 
that it actually builds and isn't loose
I<00:01:40.119> will<00:01:40.329> go<00:01:40.450> ahead<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> test<00:01:41.020> launch

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
I will go ahead and do a test launch
