wouldn't load and the substandard
internet<00:00:45.630> they<00:00:45.810> have<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.080> South<00:00:46.290> America<00:00:46.770> but

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
internet they have in South America but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.110 
internet they have in South America but

we talked about snatching off the
platform<00:00:52.130> before<00:00:53.130> I<00:00:53.340> left<00:00:53.610> looks<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
platform before I left looks like a

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.020 
platform before I left looks like a
couple<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> guys<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:54.780> doing<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
couple of guys are actually doing that

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
couple of guys are actually doing that

we should have a Matt Berger on and Tim
training<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:03.030> lighter<00:01:03.240> because

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
training a little lighter because

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.630 
training a little lighter because
they're<00:01:04.129> planning<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.190> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.790 
competition the weekend after this this
training<00:01:10.560> session<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.170> we'll<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.650> they

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
training session so we'll see what they

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.220 
training session so we'll see what they
do<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.750> know<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.530 

Ryan<00:01:20.010> had<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> hurt<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.700> shoulder<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> left

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
Ryan had a hurt and shoulder when I left

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230 
Ryan had a hurt and shoulder when I left
so<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:21.960> kind<00:01:22.800> of<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.370> interested<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> see

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so I kind of actually interested to see

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:44.680 
so I kind of actually interested to see
how<00:01:24.620> he<00:01:25.620> lives<00:01:25.860> today

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.900 

maybe<00:01:45.320> Tom's<00:01:45.650> turned<00:01:46.010> over<00:01:46.160> a<00:01:46.280> new<00:01:46.340> leaf<00:01:46.460> there

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
maybe Tom's turned over a new leaf there

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.700 
maybe Tom's turned over a new leaf there
he<00:01:47.060> isn't<00:01:47.330> walking<00:01:47.480> backwards<00:01:48.110> as<00:01:48.320> he<00:01:48.470> stands

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
he isn't walking backwards as he stands

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.150 
he isn't walking backwards as he stands
up<00:01:48.860> with<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> white<00:01:50.650> or<00:01:51.650> maybe<00:01:51.860> that's<00:01:52.040> just

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
up with the white or maybe that's just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:02.380 
up with the white or maybe that's just
wishful<00:01:52.400> thinking<00:01:52.910> on<00:01:53.000> my<00:01:53.060> part

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.670 

that's<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.540> well<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.780> fine<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.260> Don<00:02:04.440> does

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that's all well and fine when Don does

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.340 
that's all well and fine when Don does
that<00:02:04.890> gets<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.370> front<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.610> Mike<00:02:05.790> because

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
that gets right in front of Mike because

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.840 
that gets right in front of Mike because
you<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.470> Mike's<00:02:07.770> smaller<00:02:08.430> than<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
you know Mike's smaller than him and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.670 
you know Mike's smaller than him and
shorter<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.420> everything<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.320> gets

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
shorter and everything what really gets

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.580 
shorter and everything what really gets
me<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:11.310> does<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.490> with<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.120> Tom

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
me is when he does that with like Tom

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.930 
me is when he does that with like Tom
because<00:02:13.590> Tom's<00:02:13.890> got<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> much<00:02:14.340> heavier<00:02:14.580> weight

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
because Tom's got a much heavier weight

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
because Tom's got a much heavier weight
and<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.330> further<00:02:16.290> over<00:02:17.750> Tom's<00:02:18.750> head<00:02:19.110> went<00:02:19.440> up

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and it's further over Tom's head went up

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
and it's further over Tom's head went up
when<00:02:19.890> when<00:02:20.280> our<00:02:20.700> further<00:02:21.000> over<00:02:21.270> Don's<00:02:21.480> head

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
when when our further over Don's head

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.950 
when when our further over Don's head
when<00:02:21.960> Tom<00:02:22.140> stands<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.840> when<00:02:24.840> he<00:02:24.900> does

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
when Tom stands up with it when he does

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960 
when Tom stands up with it when he does
that<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.620> Tom<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> always<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.340> visions<00:02:26.730> am

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that with Tom I always have visions am

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.310 
that with Tom I always have visions am
getting<00:02:27.210> killed<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.900> wouldn't<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> good

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
getting killed that wouldn't be a good

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.380 
getting killed that wouldn't be a good
way<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.620> die<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.520> don't<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.300> would

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
way to die really I don't think it would

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.980 
way to die really I don't think it would
be<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:34.910> don't<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.330> painless<00:02:36.630> or

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
be I don't think it would be painless or

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.860 
be I don't think it would be painless or
instant<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.860> probably<00:02:38.870> involved

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
instant I think it probably involved

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.600 
instant I think it probably involved
time<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> hospital<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> slowly

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
time in a hospital where you slowly

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:56.180 
time in a hospital where you slowly
faded<00:02:42.060> away

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.730 

early<00:02:57.190> disappointed<00:02:58.110> mine's<00:02:59.110> Ella<00:02:59.350> couldn't

early disappointed mine's Ella couldn't

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.040 
early disappointed mine's Ella couldn't
have<00:02:59.830> been<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.980> Pan<00:03:00.250> Am<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.790> really<00:03:01.570> feel<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.810> if

given<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.380> opportunity<00:03:02.650> he<00:03:03.190> could<00:03:03.340> have

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
given the opportunity he could have

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.360 
given the opportunity he could have
qualified<00:03:03.910> but<00:03:04.210> you<00:03:04.540> know<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.750> never<00:03:04.960> know<00:03:05.370> I

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.280 

but<00:06:28.000> I<00:06:28.090> think<00:06:28.270> everyone<00:06:28.570> looks<00:06:29.020> like<00:06:29.080> they

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290

but I think everyone looks like they
lift<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:29.590> pretty<00:06:29.800> well<00:06:33.330> obviously<00:06:34.330> working<00:06:34.690> on

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.460 

so<00:06:46.000> I<00:06:46.030> guess<00:06:46.300> that's<00:06:46.509> it<00:06:46.780> like<00:06:47.020> I<00:06:47.050> said<00:06:47.319> I<00:06:47.349> just

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
so I guess that's it like I said I just

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.350 
so I guess that's it like I said I just
saw<00:06:47.979> that<00:06:48.009> for<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:48.370> first<00:06:48.580> time<00:06:48.789> just<00:06:49.240> like

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
saw that for the first time just like

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.050 
saw that for the first time just like
everyone<00:06:49.780> else<00:06:49.900> is<00:06:50.699> looks<00:06:51.699> like<00:06:51.789> a<00:06:51.909> good
