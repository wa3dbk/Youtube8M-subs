00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
a long time you know that plants have

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.850 
a long time you know that plants have
certain<00:00:25.510> requirements<00:00:26.140> to<00:00:26.290> do<00:00:26.440> their<00:00:26.619> best

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
certain requirements to do their best

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.590 
certain requirements to do their best
and<00:00:27.190> that's<00:00:27.400> especially<00:00:27.790> true<00:00:28.210> with

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
and that's especially true with

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.960 
and that's especially true with
vegetable<00:00:29.110> plants<00:00:29.530> so<00:00:29.920> what<00:00:30.160> are<00:00:30.310> they<00:00:30.520> well

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
vegetable plants so what are they well

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.570 
vegetable plants so what are they well
first<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.420> all<00:00:31.570> plants<00:00:32.320> need<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.710> lot<00:00:33.130> of<00:00:33.309> Sun

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
first of all plants need a lot of Sun

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.940 
first of all plants need a lot of Sun
now<00:00:33.910> eight<00:00:34.210> hours<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.900> lot<00:00:35.110> of<00:00:35.290> Sun<00:00:35.530> if<00:00:35.800> you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
now eight hours is a lot of Sun if you

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.250 
now eight hours is a lot of Sun if you
can<00:00:36.220> give<00:00:36.400> them<00:00:36.550> more<00:00:36.610> all<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.390> better<00:00:37.629> now

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
can give them more all the better now

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.810 
can give them more all the better now
can<00:00:38.530> they<00:00:38.620> get<00:00:38.770> by<00:00:38.920> with<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.160> little<00:00:39.460> bit<00:00:39.580> less

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
can they get by with a little bit less

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.270 
can they get by with a little bit less
yes<00:00:40.450> they<00:00:40.660> can<00:00:40.720> but<00:00:41.230> it<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.410> gonna<00:00:41.739> affect<00:00:41.890> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
yes they can but it is gonna affect the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.979 
yes they can but it is gonna affect the
harvest<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.850> how<00:00:42.940> they<00:00:43.120> grow<00:00:43.360> along<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.809> way

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
harvest and how they grow along the way

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.540 
harvest and how they grow along the way
maybe<00:00:44.559> they<00:00:44.800> become<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:45.129> little<00:00:45.430> more

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
maybe they become a little more

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.790 
maybe they become a little more
susceptible<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.330> pests<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:46.870> diseases<00:00:47.230> so

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
susceptible to pests and diseases so

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.530 
susceptible to pests and diseases so
anything<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.640> can<00:00:48.820> do<00:00:48.970> to<00:00:49.180> add<00:00:49.330> more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
anything that you can do to add more

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.360 
anything that you can do to add more
sunlight<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.290> soil<00:00:50.620> surface<00:00:50.890> all<00:00:51.309> the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
sunlight to the soil surface all the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.939 
sunlight to the soil surface all the
better<00:00:52.089> but<00:00:52.629> once<00:00:52.870> you've<00:00:53.019> got<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.290> full<00:00:53.680> sunny

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
better but once you've got a full sunny

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.890 
better but once you've got a full sunny
spot<00:00:54.309> like<00:00:54.519> this<00:00:54.790> one<00:00:54.970> not<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.330> tree<00:00:55.629> around

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
spot like this one not a tree around

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.990 
spot like this one not a tree around
then<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.680> want<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:56.860> look<00:00:57.040> down<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.460> focus<00:00:57.820> on

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
then you want to look down and focus on

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.530 
then you want to look down and focus on
the<00:00:58.120> soil

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
the soil

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.350 
the soil
now<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.350> soil<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.920> perfect<00:01:00.339> now<00:01:00.820> admittedly

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
now this soil is perfect now admittedly

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.390 
now this soil is perfect now admittedly
it's<00:01:01.570> been<00:01:01.750> worked<00:01:02.080> a<00:01:02.260> long<00:01:02.680> time

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
it's been worked a long time

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's been worked a long time
lots<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.850> seasons<00:01:04.360> improving<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.930> soil<00:01:05.199> but

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
lots of seasons improving this soil but

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.399 
lots of seasons improving this soil but
anybody<00:01:06.130> can<00:01:06.610> create<00:01:06.760> soil<00:01:07.210> like<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.960> it

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
anybody can create soil like this and it

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.780 
anybody can create soil like this and it
doesn't<00:01:08.770> matter<00:01:08.890> whether<00:01:09.250> you're<00:01:09.430> starting

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
doesn't matter whether you're starting

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.480 
doesn't matter whether you're starting

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
with sandy soil or heavy clay soil the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.460 
with sandy soil or heavy clay soil the
addition<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.120> organic<00:01:13.840> matter<00:01:14.020> such<00:01:14.409> as

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
addition of organic matter such as

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.270 
addition of organic matter such as
compost<00:01:15.000> rotted<00:01:16.000> manure<00:01:16.120> aged<00:01:16.690> leaves<00:01:17.440> worm

castings<00:01:18.940> all<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.570> those<00:01:19.720> things<00:01:20.049> added<00:01:20.590> to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
castings all of those things added to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.100 
castings all of those things added to
the<00:01:20.800> soil<00:01:21.070> eventually<00:01:21.790> makes<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.360> great<00:01:22.780> soil

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the soil eventually makes it great soil

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.560 
the soil eventually makes it great soil
when<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.860> talk<00:01:24.070> about<00:01:24.310> great<00:01:24.520> soil<00:01:24.820> I'm<00:01:25.060> talking

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
when I talk about great soil I'm talking

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.960 
when I talk about great soil I'm talking
about<00:01:25.660> that<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.740> drains<00:01:27.100> very<00:01:27.400> well<00:01:27.670> but

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
about that that drains very well but

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.330 
about that that drains very well but
also<00:01:28.360> holds<00:01:28.720> moisture<00:01:28.930> all<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.830> happens

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
also holds moisture all that happens

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.550 
also holds moisture all that happens
with<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> addition<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.090> organic<00:01:31.420> matter<00:01:31.900> just

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
with the addition of organic matter just

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.340 
with the addition of organic matter just
like<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.120> okay<00:01:34.120> so<00:01:34.150> we've<00:01:34.510> got<00:01:34.540> great<00:01:35.050> soil

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
like this okay so we've got great soil

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.680 
like this okay so we've got great soil
