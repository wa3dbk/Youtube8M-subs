hi I'm Amelia and I'm going to discuss

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.289 
hi I'm Amelia and I'm going to discuss
with<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.510> how<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.689> use<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> three<00:00:04.319> barrel<00:00:04.529> waver

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
with you how to use a three barrel waver

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.059 
with you how to use a three barrel waver
this<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> three<00:00:06.839> barrel<00:00:07.020> waver<00:00:07.350> it's

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is a three barrel waver it's

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.629 
this is a three barrel waver it's
basically<00:00:08.490> two<00:00:09.330> barrels<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.900> curling<00:00:10.260> iron

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
basically two barrels of a curling iron

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.839 
basically two barrels of a curling iron
with<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:12.380> third<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.740> center<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.340> what

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
with a third one in the center and what

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.200 
with a third one in the center and what
that<00:00:15.059> does<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.599> creates<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.320> nice<00:00:16.590> s<00:00:17.480> wave

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
that does is that creates a nice s wave

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
that does is that creates a nice s wave
what<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> want<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> first<00:00:22.380> section<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
hair grab the hair and with the three
barrel<00:00:45.690> wavers<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> use<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
barrel wavers you really want to use a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
barrel wavers you really want to use a
smaller<00:00:47.910> section<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> grab<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
smaller section you don't want to grab a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
smaller section you don't want to grab a
big<00:00:49.559> old<00:00:49.770> hunk<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> hair<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.000> wouldn't<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
big old hunk of hair I wouldn't use a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.090 
big old hunk of hair I wouldn't use a
section<00:00:52.469> any<00:00:52.829> wider<00:00:53.250> than<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:54.030> inch

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
section any wider than about an inch

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.170 
section any wider than about an inch
actually<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> wouldn't<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> section<00:00:56.879> any

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
actually I wouldn't use a section any

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually I wouldn't use a section any
wider<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.570> about<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> half-inch<00:00:58.730> then<00:00:59.730> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
wider than about a half-inch then you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
wider than about a half-inch then you
grab<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> waver<00:01:00.690> start<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> top<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
grab the waver start at the top of the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:13.410 
grab the waver start at the top of the
Strand<00:01:05.210> hold<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.899 

and<00:01:13.960> then<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.500> bring<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.860> down<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.400> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
and then you bring it down to the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.620 
and then you bring it down to the
beginning<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.870> next<00:01:17.229> wave<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.510> way

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
beginning of the next wave so that way

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.670 
beginning of the next wave so that way
you<00:01:19.690> don't<00:01:19.780> get<00:01:20.020> any<00:01:20.170> strange<00:01:20.290> crimps<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
you don't get any strange crimps and you

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.380 
you don't get any strange crimps and you
continue<00:01:24.159> all<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.400> way<00:01:24.580> down<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.270> very

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
continue all the way down to the very

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.200 
continue all the way down to the very
end<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.020> Strand<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:27.220> okay<00:01:27.700> if<00:01:28.030> you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
end of the Strand and it's okay if you

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.210 
end of the Strand and it's okay if you
only<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.990> end<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.410> strand<00:01:29.740> poking

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
only have the end of the strand poking

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.160 
only have the end of the strand poking
out<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.150> don't<00:01:31.450> want<00:01:31.660> like<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.869> little

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
out you just don't want like a little

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.249 
out you just don't want like a little
fish<00:01:32.440> hook<00:01:32.710> hanging<00:01:32.979> out<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.050> that's<00:01:35.050> how<00:01:35.200> you

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
fish hook hanging out and that's how you

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.210 
fish hook hanging out and that's how you
create<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.680> wave<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.350> do<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:38.800> around<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
create a wave so you do that around the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.969 
create a wave so you do that around the
rest<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.610> head<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.500> creates<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.650> nice

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
rest of the head and that creates a nice

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.070 
rest of the head and that creates a nice
s<00:01:45.990> wave<00:01:46.990> shape<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:49.149> can<00:01:49.300> comb<00:01:49.539> through<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.869> if

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
s wave shape you can comb through it if

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.270 
s wave shape you can comb through it if
you<00:01:50.170> like<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.380> give<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:50.770> more<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.070> wild

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
you like to give it more of a wild

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.150 
you like to give it more of a wild
crimped<00:01:51.789> look<00:01:51.850> or<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:53.440> can<00:01:53.649> even<00:01:53.800> brush

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
crimped look or you can even brush

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.070 
crimped look or you can even brush
through<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.820> give<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.149> nice<00:01:55.330> soft<00:01:55.690> wave

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
through it and give it a nice soft wave

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.310 
through it and give it a nice soft wave
look<00:01:57.270> something<00:01:58.270> very<00:01:58.479> reminiscent<00:01:58.929> of<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
look something very reminiscent of the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.370 
look something very reminiscent of the
1940s<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.250> that's<00:02:00.970> how<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.179> create<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.810> wave

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
1940s and that's how you create a wave

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.490 
1940s and that's how you create a wave
with<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.649> three<00:02:02.950> barrel<00:02:03.130> waver
