when<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.880> started<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.360> business<00:01:04.509> a<00:01:04.750> decade<00:01:05.080> ago

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
when I started the business a decade ago

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.920 
when I started the business a decade ago
I<00:01:05.560> made<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> point<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.610> seek<00:01:07.420> out<00:01:07.540> artists<00:01:07.870> from

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
all over the state and over the years

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.220 
all over the state and over the years
become<00:01:09.970> friends<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.540> although<00:01:10.930> they<00:01:11.110> all

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
become friends and although they all

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.630 
become friends and although they all
have<00:01:11.410> their<00:01:11.500> own<00:01:11.560> individual<00:01:12.160> little<00:01:12.430> niches

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
have their own individual little niches

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.960

going on as a whole it makes us strong

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.720 
going on as a whole it makes us strong
so<00:01:15.970> um<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:18.250> one<00:01:18.370> of<00:01:18.460> our<00:01:18.550> biggest

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
so um I think it's one of our biggest

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
so um I think it's one of our biggest
assets<00:01:22.560> let's<00:01:23.560> go<00:01:23.710> don't<00:01:24.100> work

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.940 

typically<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> process<00:01:30.290> starts<00:01:30.619> with<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
typically the process starts with the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.920 
typically the process starts with the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.139 
a whole nother process starts now we
actually<00:01:51.950> have<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.340> figure<00:01:52.490> out<00:01:52.640> how<00:01:52.940> we're

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually have to figure out how we're

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.649 
actually have to figure out how we're
going<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.450> create<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.200> mural<00:01:54.619> or<00:01:54.950> design<00:01:55.580> or

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
going to create this mural or design or

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.330 
going to create this mural or design or
finish<00:01:56.659> whatever<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.140> whatever<00:01:57.500> maybe<00:01:57.770> this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
finish whatever it whatever maybe this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.859 
finish whatever it whatever maybe this
is<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.729> most<00:01:58.910> important<00:01:59.420> it's<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.630> seed<00:01:59.840> that

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
is the most important it's a seed that

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.260 
is the most important it's a seed that
we<00:02:00.080> plant<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.560> sort<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.890> has<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.880> tree<00:02:02.030> grow

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
we plant that sort of has the tree grow

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.630 
we plant that sort of has the tree grow
but<00:02:03.080> once<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.380> get<00:02:03.470> done<00:02:03.649> with<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.039> whole

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
but once we get done with that whole

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.790 
but once we get done with that whole
nother<00:02:04.789> process<00:02:05.270> starts<00:02:05.600> that's<00:02:06.259> where<00:02:06.500> a

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
nother process starts that's where a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.320 
nother process starts that's where a
different<00:02:07.250> set<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.460> creativity<00:02:07.940> comes<00:02:08.060> into

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
different set of creativity comes into

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.490 
different set of creativity comes into
play<00:02:08.509> doesn't<00:02:08.959> matter<00:02:09.050> whether<00:02:09.259> it's<00:02:09.440> a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
play doesn't matter whether it's a

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.710 
play doesn't matter whether it's a
12-story<00:02:10.039> building<00:02:10.130> or<00:02:11.030> if<00:02:11.239> it's<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.450> small

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
12-story building or if it's a small

12-story building or if it's a small

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
little powder room there's always

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.890 
little powder room there's always

different areas of problem areas that
come<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> project<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.930> that's<00:02:18.080> fun<00:02:18.290> as

come with the project and that's fun as

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.870 
come with the project and that's fun as

that goes with painting believe it or

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.650 
that goes with painting believe it or
not<00:02:30.829> each<00:02:31.190> project<00:02:31.489> has<00:02:31.790> its<00:02:31.820> own<00:02:32.060> sort<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.420> set

not each project has its own sort of set

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
of rules and guidelines that we go

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.039 
of rules and guidelines that we go
through<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> from<00:02:35.239> each<00:02:35.420> project<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
through and from each project the

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.930 
through and from each project the
knowledge<00:02:36.320> base<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.739> built<00:02:36.980> upon<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.489> it

knowledge base that's built upon it it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.699 
knowledge base that's built upon it it
just<00:02:38.450> allows<00:02:38.690> us<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.900> do<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.200> next<00:02:39.290> one<00:02:39.440> more

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
just allows us to do the next one more

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.979 
just allows us to do the next one more
efficiently<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> even<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> last<00:02:41.660> couple<00:02:41.900> of

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
efficiently so even the last couple of

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.600 
efficiently so even the last couple of
years<00:02:42.049> I've<00:02:42.350> seen<00:02:42.560> our<00:02:42.769> work<00:02:42.950> become<00:02:43.310> ten

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
years I've seen our work become ten

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.400 
years I've seen our work become ten
times<00:02:43.820> better<00:02:44.000> we<00:02:44.630> really<00:02:44.810> don't<00:02:44.930> have<00:02:45.140> one

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
times better we really don't have one

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.080 
times better we really don't have one
particular<00:02:45.560> specialty<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.579> mean<00:02:46.790> if<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:46.970> can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
particular specialty I mean if you can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.370 
particular specialty I mean if you can
imagine<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.780> can<00:02:47.900> paint<00:02:48.079> it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440
