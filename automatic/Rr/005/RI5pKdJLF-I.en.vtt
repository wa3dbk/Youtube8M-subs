00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
 is what there is 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.719
 very good guys and girls your profile does not 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.150
 let sab update for the boom 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.160
 beats and you kill this use then 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.740
 as we see in new screen skill 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 for the gunship at a glance and it 's 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.660
 fuck do not speak or for gunships and that 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.210
 it looks like a tank or a troop or a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.820
 mix of side the truth because well of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 that color that is blue like the tanks and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.570
 with those two cannons it seems that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 merged the turks with the tanks or 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.700
 you know, but it's not a new one 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.160
 skill for the gunship we are not going to 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.320
 see below what this 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.360
 skill is pretty excited so 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.970
 that looks at first glance 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.580
 here we can see it is a kind of 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.590
 package that distributes as ones 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.290
 small mini tanks that load everything 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.660
 and I was pretty curious the thing to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.950
 look like every time we go up 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.610
 this unit 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.610
 mini tanks will pack more there 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.150
 that go back to level 1 they will come out 6 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.340
 critters or what is said in English 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.200
 clijsters and search for the translation and not 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.610
 appears nothing seems a movie seems 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.100
 something grayling so I do not know that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.690
 translated they rate him although good watching 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.210
 the latest update they have made to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 clans cases and is that it was put 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.080
 air controller to air cannons 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.390
 well go you will see what they 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.050
 will be increased by one per level 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.910
 I do not know the maximum level they can have 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.660
 but now we are going to see it next 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.570
 in the video come a few I would say 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.290
 that maybe you can reach level 8 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 like the torchbearers and the grenadiers 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 here we see that you can have an army 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.240
 that look like soldiers this is worth going to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.549
 watch now the video 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.070
 well here we have the video is an ipad of 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.770
 developer and we can see my work 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.490
 be in the village let's see now a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.810
 gameplay that we started good starts 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.009
 with two hundred energies is very for 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.899
 developer then I'll repeat it 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.470
 so that nobody puts nonsense in the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.989
 comments 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.290
 we see that there are spears to all and 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.470
 we observe that at the beginning it is worth eight 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.480
 each new unit that is launched is worth 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.380
 five more there we see that it looks like a million 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.180
 as if they were soldiers and destroy with 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.780
 enough speed we damage that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.850
 They will have but look like the one and that is that fuck 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.340
 in the host in the shit is 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.310
 I would like to prove it to me 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.030
 I have the doubt of whether for example 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.100
 you use the crit in these and all 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.620
 doctors if they can cure doctors to 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.450
 these units because if so 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.100
 you can throw a lot with a lot of 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 soldiers and me that 7 that loads you to the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.150
 village the only thing that would worry you would be 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.860
 the mines well you also have to see the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.500
 life that they have maybe a mine 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.140
 anyone can kill them but good and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.870
 we will see it in the following sneak peeks 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.000
 this although he puts that is the first sneak 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.610
 peek really 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.640
 let's say it's the third or so because 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.440
 has already put others in those who have said 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.940
 how do I put in the images to 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.470
 Then you can change the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.860
 name just like even clans just 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.160
 once 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.430
 there will also be changes in the newspaper 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.080
 of attacks in colors will appear for 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.210
 make it easier to identify when 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520
 they attack you when you destroy a base 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.400
 when he reconquers you on a base when 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.160
 is the terror doctor et cetera et cetera 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.890
 they are also going to change the terror doctor 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.580
 notice here is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.860
 the most interesting thing so that you have less 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.860
 phases is to say right now it has 20 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.300
 phases and for the great majority because although 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.400
 it's a bit heavy having to do the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.830
 first phases to give you 10,000 of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.480
 pieces something like that I that I have level 56 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.910
 Well man 10,000 pieces of 90 make 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 nothing so now instead of 20 phases 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.420
 they go personally seven phases but 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.280
 direct fuck if they put seven phases 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.709
 they will only remove resources and not 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.830
 I will be able to improve as many things as 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.489
 could better before not attention by in 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.130
 seven phases but the first phase is going to 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.530
 be the same as the first phase of the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.930
 before which when there were 20 and the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.570
 seventh phase will be just as difficult 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.140
 that the level 20 phase is to say that 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.110
 between phase 1 and 2 of the new one going to 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.740
 have a lot 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.110
 more change than phase 1 and 2 of the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.660
 previous 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.550
 the reward will also be very much 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.650
 greater because there are seven phases 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.100
 you have to divide the reward and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.380
 apart they will put a new 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.480
 a new event is to say the doctor of 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.060
 roses on Wednesdays and Saturdays 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.860
 have said that they are going to put another event what 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.140
 that I do not know yet is what they're going to put 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.240
 sure it's the next snakepit to what 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.710
 better the next sneak peeks is some 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.540
 skill or of the military that this or the 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.860
 life that has that that would also be 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.600
 quite interesting they said it 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.450
 although I do not think it takes a long time 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.490
 for the update if they have put and the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.090
 first I calculate that maybe what 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.980
 can you put in for Tuesday or so it's 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.110
 when they usually put the updates 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.090
 from bombay we go the previous ones always 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.060
 it's been a Tuesday 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.110
 and nothing else I really liked 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.210
 quite this skill sure that is the 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.210
 you have at level 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.850
 from headquarters 19 because they said that 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.010
 for barracks 19 and barracks 20 I wanted 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.479
 pull out a new thing that only 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.690
 could unblock with those barracks 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:48.400
 so I imagine that this tank can be 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.699
 unblock level headquarters 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.650
 19 and now the question will be that you can 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.060
 unblock with the headquarters of 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.560
 level 20 if they will put it in this 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.440
 update that I do not believe if they have already 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.810
 put this or they will put it in the next 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.280
 I like to see a helicopter 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.620
 a helicopter has to be fundamental 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.630
 If we have tanks, we have soldiers 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.790
 we have warriors have to miss a 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.070
 fucking helicopter that is a wooden author 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.860
 without in clear cases there are dragons and 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.440
 minions and other aerial shots because 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.639
 here pussy no helicopters fuck that 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.919
 take out a helicopter and I can 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.689
 to equalize things by air since 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.199
 you can only give him the francs 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.900
 rocket launchers and others as you take out a 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.050
 new defense that they do not take out another 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.669
 air traffic controller because but he puts a 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.379
 action name must also be 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.789
 fired the employee of his profile that 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.400
 he has put that good name on me 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.379
 roll up the video over here if it has 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.360
 I would greatly appreciate a little hand 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.400
 up and if you did not like to put 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.990
 because we liked it and if you do not want 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.219
 vote then do not vote watch the video now 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.219
 it is until then
