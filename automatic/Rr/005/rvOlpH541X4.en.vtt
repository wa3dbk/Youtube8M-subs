00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello my dear friends 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.140
 Dmitry Fedotov and a glad you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.150
 welcome as part of support and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 launch our course 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 express course up a fashion portrait and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.299
 Generally on shooting portraits I would 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.060
 I wanted to share one with you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.640
 little life hacking who saved me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.820
 quite a large number of times this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 backlit shooting if you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 you know, any camera has 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 several different expo metering modes 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.610
 and, accordingly, in most cases 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 the camera compares the light picture 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 which we have with what is sewn in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 his memory and thus builds 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.590
 the whole exposition of our snapshot and 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.680
 This is especially noticeable with backlight 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.079
 as usually when we have bright 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 light our with you in our with you 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 photos we get very and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.859
 very dark footage with which then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.980
 extremely not pleasant to work in that regard 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 that we have lost parts in the shadows and yes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 In general, in principle, the picture is obtained 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.810
 not very good so how is it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.150
 avoid all we need for that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 our palms because you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.159
 sorry no blend will save you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.340
 from such a backlight so what 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.350
 we need to do to put your hand 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.619
 over the top directly 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.299
 lens and make it so that 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.790
 viewfinder your hand covered all 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.579
 This is the zone in this way. 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 make your photo look like 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.610
 here so agree it is absolutely 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 another black and white picture and camera 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.840
 when you see and you will exhibit at 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.549
 halfway down your 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.180
 exposure it will work as if 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.560
 this is shooting in the shadows you get good 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.500
 base colors with which subsequently 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 you will already be focused 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.229
 on our face the street of our model 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.860
 fixed a shadow in the light chamber 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.630
 the picture then removed the hand and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.770
 accordingly got a good shadow 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.480
 a picture with bright colors without loss 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.209
 any details in the subject 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.060
 and got a nice soft backlight 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.400
 which ultimately gives us this 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.890
