it definitely lives up to its name it's
just<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.070> beast<00:02:01.850> sniper<00:02:02.330> rifle

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
just that it's that beast sniper rifle

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.780 
just that it's that beast sniper rifle
where<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.440> kill<00:02:03.710> rows<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.520> rows<00:02:04.550> of

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
where you can just kill rows and rows of

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.580 
where you can just kill rows and rows of
zombies<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.570> one<00:02:05.750> shot<00:02:06.050> I'm<00:02:06.290> guessing

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
zombies are the one shot I'm guessing

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.350 
zombies are the one shot I'm guessing
that's<00:02:06.800> why<00:02:07.100> they<00:02:07.310> need<00:02:07.550> with<00:02:07.729> penetrator

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
that's why they need with penetrator

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.350 
that's why they need with penetrator
because<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> single<00:02:10.729> shot<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.180> can

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
because with with a single shot you can

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.150 
because with with a single shot you can
take<00:02:11.570> upwards<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:12.080> like<00:02:12.230> five<00:02:12.530> zombies<00:02:13.010> out

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
take upwards of like five zombies out

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.100 
take upwards of like five zombies out
