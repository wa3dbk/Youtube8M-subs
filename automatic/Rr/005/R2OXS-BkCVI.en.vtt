00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
good there we go that's a lot brighter

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.509 
good there we go that's a lot brighter
so<00:02:19.110> yeah<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> crafting<00:02:19.800> recipe<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
so yeah the crafting recipe for the

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.970 
so yeah the crafting recipe for the
computer<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.080> need<00:02:22.349> seven

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
computer is like this so you need seven

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.890 
computer is like this so you need seven
iron<00:02:23.280> blocks<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.330> seven<00:02:24.629> one<00:02:24.750> two<00:02:24.780> three

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
iron blocks to that seven one two three

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.559 
iron blocks to that seven one two three
four<00:02:25.230> five<00:02:25.500> six<00:02:25.650> seven<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.220> bit<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.209> glass<00:02:27.420> in

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
four five six seven one bit of glass in

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.330 
four five six seven one bit of glass in
the<00:02:27.660> middle<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.260> redstone<00:02:28.769> under<00:02:29.250> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the middle and then redstone under it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.220 
the middle and then redstone under it
and<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.640> will<00:02:29.760> give<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.090> computer<00:02:30.690> now

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and that will give you your computer now

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
and that will give you your computer now
because<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:31.890> expensive<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:32.879> wanted

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
because it's so expensive what I wanted

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.839 
because it's so expensive what I wanted
to<00:02:33.299> do<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.690> add<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> useful<00:02:34.530> function<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> but

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
to do is add a useful function to it but

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.970 
to do is add a useful function to it but
I<00:02:35.879> currently<00:02:36.379> can't<00:02:37.379> really<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.830> of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
I currently can't really think of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
I currently can't really think of
anything<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.879> have<00:02:38.970> any<00:02:39.120> guys<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
anything so if you have any guys if you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.020 
anything so if you have any guys if you
guys<00:02:40.349> have<00:02:40.650> any<00:02:40.799> ideas<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
guys have any ideas for what the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.420 
guys have any ideas for what the
computer<00:02:42.599> could<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.500> let<00:02:44.250> me<00:02:44.280> know

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
computer could actually do let me know

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.080 
computer could actually do let me know
don't<00:02:45.209> suggest<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:46.280> play<00:02:47.280> Minecraft<00:02:47.849> in

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
don't suggest like play Minecraft in

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.819 
don't suggest like play Minecraft in
Minecraft<00:02:48.569> because<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.319> not<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
Minecraft because that is not going to

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.250 
Minecraft because that is not going to
happen<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.250> want<00:02:50.430> something<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.780> could

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
happen I want something that this could

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.100 
happen I want something that this could
do<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.950> opens<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.519> GUI<00:02:53.849> or<00:02:54.090> something

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
do so it opens up a GUI or something

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.650 
do so it opens up a GUI or something
also<00:02:55.769> nothing<00:02:56.099> like<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.849> computer<00:02:57.420> crap<00:02:57.599> I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
also nothing like that computer crap I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.000 
also nothing like that computer crap I
think<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.930> computer<00:02:58.319> craft<00:02:58.560> or<00:02:58.739> something

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
think it's computer craft or something

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.550 
think it's computer craft or something
like<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.239> I'm<00:03:00.239> not<00:03:00.450> sure<00:03:00.660> entirely<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
like that I'm not sure entirely what the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680 
like that I'm not sure entirely what the
mod<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.920> called<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.239> enter<00:03:03.420> like

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
mod is called but you can enter like

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.150 
mod is called but you can enter like
commands<00:03:04.110> stuff<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.620> don't<00:03:04.680> want<00:03:04.950> something

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
commands stuff I don't want something

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
commands stuff I don't want something
like<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.730> something<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.629> could

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
like that I want something they could

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.110 
like that I want something they could
possibly<00:03:07.379> do<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.879> do<00:03:09.000> with

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
possibly do with I think to do with

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.809 
possibly do with I think to do with
items<00:03:09.620> possibly<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.860> let<00:03:11.099> me<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.370> let<00:03:11.760> me

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
know if you have any ideas on the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.490 
know if you have any ideas on the
computer<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.790> table<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.840> just

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
computer this table here is just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.650 
computer this table here is just
everything<00:03:17.459> they<00:03:17.790> have<00:03:17.910> headed<00:03:18.269> into<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
everything they have headed into the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.599 
everything they have headed into the
electronic<00:03:19.079> update<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.620> far<00:03:19.859> so<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> couple<00:03:20.489> of

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
electronic update so far so a couple of

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.750 
electronic update so far so a couple of
updates<00:03:21.030> ago<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> added<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.079> this<00:03:22.200> TV<00:03:22.620> here<00:03:22.889> it's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
updates ago I added in this TV here it's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.360 
updates ago I added in this TV here it's
not<00:03:23.940> finished<00:03:24.329> right<00:03:24.540> yet<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.950> because<00:03:26.100> I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
not finished right yet just because I'm

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.180 
not finished right yet just because I'm
still<00:03:26.579> working<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.269> animated<00:03:27.900> stuff<00:03:28.190> it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
still working on like animated stuff it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.729 
still working on like animated stuff it
doesn't<00:03:29.849> really<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.209> anything<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.660> now

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
doesn't really do anything right now

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.199 
doesn't really do anything right now
except<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.950> creepers<00:03:32.519> sound<00:03:32.760> which<00:03:33.030> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
except for this creepers sound which I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.170 
except for this creepers sound which I
was<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.389> testing<00:03:34.019> out<00:03:34.549> we<00:03:35.549> have<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.940> then

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
was just testing out we have and then

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.229 
was just testing out we have and then
the<00:03:36.389> computer<00:03:37.190> next<00:03:38.190> I'm<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.819> sure<00:03:39.030> what's

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the computer next I'm not sure what's

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.470 
the computer next I'm not sure what's
going<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.989> think<00:03:40.940> what<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:41.970> wanted<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> add

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
going to be I think what I wanted to add

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.830 
going to be I think what I wanted to add
in<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.750> electronic<00:03:43.230> update<00:03:43.590> was<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:44.190> stereo

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
in the electronic update was a stereo

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.569 
in the electronic update was a stereo
there<00:03:45.840> was<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.109> fire<00:03:46.410> alarm<00:03:46.889> as<00:03:47.130> well<00:03:47.310> which

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
there was a fire alarm as well which

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.460 
there was a fire alarm as well which
detects<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.209> there's<00:03:48.419> fire<00:03:48.720> around<00:03:49.169> which

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
detects if there's fire around which

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890 
detects if there's fire around which
would<00:03:49.620> be<00:03:49.739> awesome<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> check<00:03:51.299> out<00:03:51.480> some

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
would be awesome you can check out some

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
would be awesome you can check out some
of<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.139> ideas<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.739> have<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.340> wiki<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.819> all

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
of the ideas I have on my wiki and all

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900 
of the ideas I have on my wiki and all
that<00:03:54.180> kind<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.510> brings<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> topic<00:03:55.169> so<00:03:55.910> over

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that kind of brings up a topic so over

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.479 
that kind of brings up a topic so over
the<00:03:57.000> past<00:03:57.239> probably<00:03:57.780> -<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.739> month<00:03:59.430> or<00:03:59.730> something

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
the past probably - a month or something

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.610 
the past probably - a month or something
