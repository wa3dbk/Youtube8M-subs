00:00:00.330 --> 00:01:19.579
 [Music] 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.579
 yes 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.200
 well let's see if we have gold in the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.110
 production then here we have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 a solution where we have dissolved gold 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.190
 and now a solution 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.670
 and now let's check with a toothpick 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.880
 from those 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.909
 if there really is gold or there is no gold 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.909
 in these options it is worth 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.060
 here we have the stick that is wet 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.210
 you put the solution that contains gold between 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 other things 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.310
 and here we have an acid function 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.310
 code and tin 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.500
 So what we are going to do is put 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.860
 a few drops of hydrochloric acid where 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.110
 it has dissolved 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.400
 this year and if the solution the color of the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.280
 Stick has to be changed if there is 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.300
 put purple or black one of the two 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.300
 things are worth now we apply the droplet 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.640
 you already see changes color 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.290
 if it keeps the color then we do not have 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.360
 then 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.700
 if I change color where I do want 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.310
 well you can see clearly 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.870
 the stick has become quite dark 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.520
 then that shows that in this 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.030
 solution 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.569
 yes we have gold is worth then for 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 what 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.170
 do not think it 's a cheat then 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 we repeat the teacher the same solution 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.850
 we take another bucket 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.850
 this solution we apply vale 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.540
 it seems we have put too much 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.780
 already changed color has put 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.780
 rago 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.010
 if it is the same, the camera remains a 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.250
 little more 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.620
 with more light and looks better has not 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.540
 soaked too much but then 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.129
 strictly powder 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.280
 So what are we going to do to 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.280
 continuation 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.700
 check also on paper for 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.120
 choose with more stream 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.150
 Well, we take from here 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.400
 we are just a little bit we put a 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.060
 tad 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 OK 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:03.150
 what we do is the same then this 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.150
 liquid and we apply it on paper 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.220
 well you know that both the paper and 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.140
 [Music] 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.300
 like the toothpick 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.800
 then yes there is gold yes that is 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.959
 presence of the choir 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.959
 [Music] 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.610
 Bah 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.950
 and more 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.280
 [Music] 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.490
 or 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:44.709
 i 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.709
