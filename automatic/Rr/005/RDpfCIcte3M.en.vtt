 featured with moto gp and samsung galaxy s 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 android's right have those who like have 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 others who do not like but is to know 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 who initializes the mobile first 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 from wim salts to make it ready to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.080
 power person is already leaving working let's go 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 singing that left the Iraqi killed with the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 finger right here rather than right 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.250
 come on 1 2 3 and let's start counting 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.510
 here by da's computer stamp 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.510
 camcorder 12 13 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:15.190
 ten seconds 15 seconds 20 seconds 25 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 seconds and 30 seconds and 33 seconds 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.240
 here and 35 seconds 33 and 35 seconds 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.289
 very little difference 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.910
 Ok guys, this is it, the tse that I 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.560
 I see that nowadays the cell phone is 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.470
 much faster in the past 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.960
 It took longer carried around in the range 50 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.660
 seconds a minute to boot 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.090
 now you saw there that it's too short 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.670
 a little more than 30 seconds 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 every one for booting touch 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.369
 folks 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.990
 so I do not think I'll do more 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.360
 testing with these two phones 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.610
 here is good has other videos in which 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.960
 already has the channel of these two phones that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.869
 I will still make a comparison between 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.810
 they in the operating system part 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.700
 applications and everything else 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.460
 personal touch if you liked your jewelry 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.460
