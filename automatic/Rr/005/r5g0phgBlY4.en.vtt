in the end of the tube you can use a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.780 
in the end of the tube you can use a

1/16 inch drill bit and you can remove

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.539 
1/16 inch drill bit and you can remove
the<00:01:43.210> flow<00:01:43.750> restriction<00:01:44.380> from<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.399> flow

restrictor the old floor structures
required<00:01:49.180> removing<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.869> forrester

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
required removing the forrester

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.530 
required removing the forrester
completely<00:01:51.070> because<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.850> restriction<00:01:52.420> would

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
completely because the restriction would

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.679 
completely because the restriction would
always<00:01:52.689> be<00:01:53.049> behind<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.860> floor<00:01:54.310> structure<00:01:54.700> if

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
always be behind a floor structure if

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.749 
always be behind a floor structure if
you<00:01:55.750> want<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.200> remove<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:56.740> point<00:01:56.979> it's

you want to remove this point it's

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.420 
you want to remove this point it's
simply<00:01:57.909> unscrews<00:01:58.689> from<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.200> tube<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.590> you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
simply unscrews from the tube and you

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.420 
simply unscrews from the tube and you
have<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:04.049> 1/16<00:02:05.049> hole<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.890> stainless<00:02:06.369> steel

with that hole size

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.100 
with that hole size
and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.910> threads<00:02:14.210> into<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.660> end<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.020> the
