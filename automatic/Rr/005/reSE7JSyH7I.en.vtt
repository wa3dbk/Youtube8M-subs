00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
but um one other thing is the other

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
but um one other thing is the other
squads<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> most<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.549> probably<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
squads that most of you will probably be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
squads that most of you will probably be
put<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.450> after<00:01:51.960> four<00:01:52.200> practices<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:53.040> be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
put into after four practices will be

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.810 
put into after four practices will be
the<00:01:53.460> normal<00:01:53.939> squads<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.369> when<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.640> put

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the normal squads and when you get put

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.609 
the normal squads and when you get put
into<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.119> normal<00:01:57.540> squad<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
into a normal squad what is going to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
into a normal squad what is going to
happen<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.729> little<00:02:00.060> less

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
happen is it's going to be a little less

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.740 
happen is it's going to be a little less
strict<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> reason<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> being<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
strict but the reason for that being the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
strict but the reason for that being the
introductory<00:02:04.590> squads<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.340> strict<00:02:05.700> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
introductory squads are just strict so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
introductory squads are just strict so
that<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:07.110> TG<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
that you get what TG is all about if you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.010 
that you get what TG is all about if you
