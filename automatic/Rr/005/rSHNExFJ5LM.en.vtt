I know most of you going to be like wait
this<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.970> too<00:00:09.000> fast<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.200> video<00:00:10.500> would

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
this is too fast that this video would

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.589 
this is too fast that this video would
have<00:00:10.769> been<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.070> over<00:00:11.550> 10<00:00:11.880> minutes<00:00:12.030> long<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:12.509> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
have been like over 10 minutes long if I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.259 
have been like over 10 minutes long if I
didn't<00:00:12.809> speed<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.259> fast<00:00:14.250> bit<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.000> first

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
didn't speed up this fast bit so first

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.029 
didn't speed up this fast bit so first
off<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.780> say<00:00:15.960> I've<00:00:16.049> dug<00:00:16.289> freehold<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
off as you say I've dug freehold and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.460 
off as you say I've dug freehold and
they<00:00:17.520> need<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.880> eight<00:00:18.210> long<00:00:18.570> each<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.289> like

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
they need to be eight long each so like

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490 
they need to be eight long each so like
you<00:00:19.619> dig<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.400> eight<00:00:20.699> across<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.960> then

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you dig one like eight across and then

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.689 
you dig one like eight across and then
you<00:00:22.619> need<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> fill<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.640> water

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you need to fill them all up with water

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
you need to fill them all up with water
so<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.330> still<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:25.109> an<00:00:25.260> unlimited<00:00:25.529> water

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
so it's still like an unlimited water

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.450 
so it's still like an unlimited water
source<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> am<00:00:27.359> now<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.340> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
then you want to put one block here like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.810 
then you want to put one block here like
this<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.770> put<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.280> doesn't<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> be

the water but make sure you don't erase
it<00:00:44.760> by<00:00:44.910> placing<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> block<00:00:45.629> actually<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it by placing the block actually in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
it by placing the block actually in
there<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.280> I've<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.760> channels

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there as you see I've got two channels

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
there as you see I've got two channels
now<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.170> where<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:49.980> seeds<00:00:51.649> as<00:00:53.000> I'm

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
now so where I can put my seeds as I'm

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.869 
now so where I can put my seeds as I'm
doing<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> same<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.510> side

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
doing now then you do the same this side

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.430 
doing now then you do the same this side
and<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.780> enough<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.320> always

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and if two is not enough you can always

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
and if two is not enough you can always
extend<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.489> another<00:01:02.520> channel<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.359> do

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
extend it for another channel like I do

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.899 
extend it for another channel like I do
here<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:06.500> do<00:01:07.500> place<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> couple<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> wrong

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
here I do place a couple in the wrong

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.950 
here I do place a couple in the wrong
place<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.979> crack<00:01:11.729> myself<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.659> mean

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
place but I like crack myself if I mean

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.399 
place but I like crack myself if I mean
like<00:01:13.369> realize<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.610> done<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:14.909> wrong

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.429 

and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.979> fill<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:21.439> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and then you just fill up this one it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
and then you just fill up this one it's
quite<00:01:22.619> easy<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.520> takes<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
quite easy to do it just takes like a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.149 
quite easy to do it just takes like a
long<00:01:24.479> time<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.049> record<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.950> some

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
long time to like record it in some

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
long time to like record it in some
reason<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.659> I've<00:01:27.780> went<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.200> over

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
reason as you see how I've went one over

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.859 
reason as you see how I've went one over
by<00:01:28.680> accident<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> realize<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
by accident but then I realize and I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.160 
by accident but then I realize and I
have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.710> pickaxe<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.509> kicks

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.630 

so<00:01:37.170> yeah<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> place<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> over

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
so yeah you need to place that over

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.380 
so yeah you need to place that over
where<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> water<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.210> keep

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
where the water is and then just keep

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
where the water is and then just keep
doing<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.350> place<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:43.950> seats

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
doing that and then place your seats

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
doing that and then place your seats
again<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> should<00:01:45.810> stop<00:01:46.079> going

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
again and then it should stop going

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
again and then it should stop going
really<00:01:46.530> fast<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.790> I've<00:01:47.909> placed

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
really fast like now after I've placed

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.260 
really fast like now after I've placed
my<00:01:48.299> seeds<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.820> probably<00:01:51.030> will

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
my seeds then it will it's probably will

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
my seeds then it will it's probably will
take<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.869> halves<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> upload<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.770> me

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
take about two halves to upload for me

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
take about two halves to upload for me
as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.820> gone<00:01:54.000> normal<00:01:54.360> speed<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.659> so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
as you see it's gone normal speed now so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.370 
as you see it's gone normal speed now so
we<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> place<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> block<00:01:57.540> behind<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
we want to place a block behind the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560 
we want to place a block behind the
channel<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.610> we'll<00:01:59.790> call<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> vets<00:02:00.270> without

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
channel so we'll call the vets without

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.620 
channel so we'll call the vets without
cobblestone<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> channels<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.969> then<00:02:02.969> i'm

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
cobblestone the channels and then i'm

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
cobblestone the channels and then i'm
just<00:02:03.689> showing<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.649> word<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.070> i<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.610> put

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just showing that's word so i can put

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.089 
just showing that's word so i can put
piston<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.619> wood<00:02:07.829> can

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
piston on that then have to be wood can

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.880 
piston on that then have to be wood can
be<00:02:08.129> coupled<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.700> i<00:02:08.729> said<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> looks

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
be coupled like i said but it just looks

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.260 
be coupled like i said but it just looks
very<00:02:10.890> much<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.069> same<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> piston<00:02:11.940> without

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
very much the same as a piston without

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.970 
very much the same as a piston without
the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150 
the
Rock<00:02:13.980> better<00:02:14.280> phenom<00:02:14.670> ii<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.600> stone<00:02:16.080> then<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
Rock better phenom ii the stone then you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.570 
Rock better phenom ii the stone then you
want<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> build<00:02:18.000> up<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.160> place<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
want to build up so you can place the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.510 
want to build up so you can place the
water<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.209> top<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.690> well<00:02:22.560> no<00:02:22.740> not<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.160> top<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
water on top of well no not on top of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.590 
water on top of well no not on top of
next<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.240> piston<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.000> extended

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
next to the piston so when it's extended

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.720 
next to the piston so when it's extended
the<00:02:27.750> water<00:02:27.959> does<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.260> flow<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the water does not flow like here so you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.809 
the water does not flow like here so you
place<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> water<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:32.040> that's<00:02:32.250> extended

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
place the water in when that's extended

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.479 
place the water in when that's extended
you<00:02:32.910> place<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> watering<00:02:33.630> right<00:02:33.780> there<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
you place a watering right there and

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.040 
you place a watering right there and
then<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.550> won't<00:02:35.790> flow<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.780> do

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
then it won't flow and then we just do

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.710 
then it won't flow and then we just do
that<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.260> all<00:02:37.500> three<00:02:37.800> or<00:02:38.360> 20<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:39.390> feel

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that for all three or 20 or feel

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.430 
that for all three or 20 or feel
building<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> massive<00:02:41.660> 120<00:02:42.660> watt<00:02:43.050> random

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
building the massive 120 watt random

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.009 
building the massive 120 watt random
number<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:45.290> went<00:02:46.290> up<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.500> higher<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:48.810> quite

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
number I went up to higher it's quite

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.870 
number I went up to higher it's quite
easy<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.440> build<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.280> follow<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.610> step

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
easy to build it's just follow it step

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.710 
easy to build it's just follow it step
by<00:02:51.030> step<00:02:51.209> it's<00:02:51.989> very<00:02:52.560> easy<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.570> it's<00:02:54.570> just

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
by step it's very easy to do it's just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
by step it's very easy to do it's just
time<00:02:55.019> consuming<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.370> why<00:02:56.519> this

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
time consuming really that's why this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.240 
time consuming really that's why this
video<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.090> quite<00:02:57.330> long<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:59.069> I've

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
video is quite long and as you see I've

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.290 
video is quite long and as you see I've
put<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:01.040> places<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.160> hold<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> water<00:03:02.700> like

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
put the places to hold the water like

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.360 
put the places to hold the water like
that<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.989> when<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.290> Pistons<00:03:04.709> are<00:03:04.860> extended

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
that so when the Pistons are extended

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.850 
that so when the Pistons are extended
then<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.780> put<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> water<00:03:07.230> actually<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.709> there

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
then I can put a water actually in there

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
then I can put a water actually in there
so<00:03:08.400> now<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.850> come<00:03:09.000> behind<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
so now you want to come behind it and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.870 
so now you want to come behind it and
destroy<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.680> block<00:03:11.160> here<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.850> I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
destroy you this block here the one I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.820 
destroy you this block here the one I
was<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.209> looking<00:03:12.510> at<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.380> middle<00:03:13.680> one

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
was just looking at the middle one

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.880 
was just looking at the middle one
because<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:14.700> when<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.910> place<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> redstone

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
because then when you place a redstone

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.110 
because then when you place a redstone
redstone<00:03:16.890> dust<00:03:17.370> or<00:03:17.610> whatever<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.060> called

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
redstone dust or whatever it's called

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720 
redstone dust or whatever it's called
and<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.750> put<00:03:18.900> leave<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.470> should<00:03:19.680> hear<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and you put leave it you should hear the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.990 
and you put leave it you should hear the
actual<00:03:20.880> sound<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> piston<00:03:22.340> moving<00:03:23.340> going

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
actual sound of the piston moving going

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759 
actual sound of the piston moving going
up<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.239> down<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.110> can<00:03:25.260> hear<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.560> and

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
up and down so if you can hear that and

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.410 
up and down so if you can hear that and
you<00:03:25.860> know<00:03:26.010> you've<00:03:26.160> done<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> right<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:27.180> need

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
you know you've done it right you need

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.050 
you know you've done it right you need
to<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.959> all<00:03:28.140> three<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.910> see

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
to do that with all three and to see

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.449 
to do that with all three and to see
i'll<00:03:30.180> show<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.540> piston<00:03:30.870> up<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:32.190> need<00:03:32.340> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
i'll show the piston up that you need to

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.300 
i'll show the piston up that you need to
do<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.579> we're<00:03:32.820> all<00:03:32.940> free<00:03:33.920> some<00:03:34.920> reason<00:03:35.220> i

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
do that we're all free some reason i

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.100 
do that we're all free some reason i
thought<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.670> needed<00:03:35.880> redstone<00:03:36.450> torches<00:03:36.810> but

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
thought you needed redstone torches but

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.330 
thought you needed redstone torches but
you<00:03:37.170> don't<00:03:37.350> actually<00:03:37.500> need<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.890> redstone

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
you don't actually need the redstone

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.130 
you don't actually need the redstone
torches<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.209> don't<00:03:39.870> do<00:03:39.989> this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
torches so you don't don't do this

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.819 
torches so you don't don't do this
battle<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.700> can't<00:03:41.910> be<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> way<00:03:42.450> oh

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
battle but it can't be on the way oh

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
redstone i linked up with the redstone

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.160 
redstone i linked up with the redstone
talk<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.269> them<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.959> don't

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
talk to them and that but you don't

talk to them and that but you don't
actually<00:03:58.320> need<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> do<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.130> need<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.120> just

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
actually need to do that need to just

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.479 
actually need to do that need to just
bring<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.470> round<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.890> edge<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:02.370> you're

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
bring it round the edge and if you're

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.920 
bring it round the edge and if you're
doing<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.790> underground<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.540> will<00:04:03.690> need<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
doing this underground you will need a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.280 
doing this underground you will need a
lot<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.200> light<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:05.160> actually<00:04:05.519> do<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.290> say

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
lot of light to actually do this say

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.970 
lot of light to actually do this say
look<00:04:07.470> glowstone<00:04:08.070> or<00:04:08.630> torches<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.859> yeah<00:04:10.859> he

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
look glowstone or torches and yeah he

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.470 
look glowstone or torches and yeah he
just<00:04:11.130> knew<00:04:11.310> quite<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.579> lot<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.269> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
just knew quite a lot like to that and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.500 
just knew quite a lot like to that and
if<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.769> underground<00:04:14.190> then<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.239> can<00:04:15.390> just

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
if it is underground then you can just

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.930 
if it is underground then you can just
probably<00:04:15.720> use<00:04:15.930> bone<00:04:16.169> meal<00:04:16.549> instead<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.669> light

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
probably use bone meal instead of light

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.140 
probably use bone meal instead of light
is<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.140> won't<00:04:19.289> grow<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.430> yeah<00:04:20.609> most<00:04:21.030> people

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
is it won't grow but yeah most people

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.909 
is it won't grow but yeah most people
like<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.479> do<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.750> underground<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:22.800> how

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
like to do this underground and see how

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.860 
like to do this underground and see how
you<00:04:22.979> can<00:04:23.190> see<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> red<00:04:23.760> stone<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.539> can<00:04:24.720> hide

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
you can see the red stone you can hide

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.270 
you can see the red stone you can hide
the<00:04:24.900> red<00:04:25.229> stone<00:04:25.500> when<00:04:25.800> you're<00:04:25.919> under

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the red stone when you're under

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.180 
the red stone when you're under
and<00:04:26.430> anyway<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:26.850> give<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.020> somewhere<00:04:28.830> cool

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
and anyway so give it up somewhere cool

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.590 
and anyway so give it up somewhere cool
and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.730> put<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> lever<00:04:30.180> somewhere

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
and then just put the lever somewhere

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.290 
and then just put the lever somewhere
else<00:04:30.720> do<00:04:31.380> not<00:04:31.590> put<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.040> redstone<00:04:32.880> repeater

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
else do not put the redstone repeater

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180 
else do not put the redstone repeater
that<00:04:33.450> way<00:04:33.600> like<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.960> did<00:04:34.170> because<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.680> forgot

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
that way like I did because I forgot

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.970 
that way like I did because I forgot
that<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:36.240> Power<00:04:36.480> has<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:37.260> run<00:04:37.470> in<00:04:37.740> one

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
that the Power has to run in one

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.960 
that the Power has to run in one
direction<00:04:39.710> there's<00:04:40.710> no<00:04:40.950> publicity<00:04:41.310> stunt<00:04:41.820> by

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
direction there's no publicity stunt by

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.170 
direction there's no publicity stunt by
death<00:04:42.180> now<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.080> need<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.830> wherever<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
death now so you need to wherever the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.780 
death now so you need to wherever the
lever<00:04:45.389> is<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.010> put<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.310> here<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.730> I

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
lever is like I put it here and I

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.310 
lever is like I put it here and I
realize<00:04:48.150> there's<00:04:48.300> not<00:04:48.510> only<00:04:48.600> up<00:04:48.870> because<00:04:49.230> i

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
realize there's not only up because i

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.900 
realize there's not only up because i
put<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> register<00:04:50.160> repeat<00:04:50.430> around<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.820> wrong

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
put the register repeat around the wrong

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.120 
put the register repeat around the wrong
way<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.180> need<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.570> face<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.620> way<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
way you need to face it the way the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.580 
way you need to face it the way the
currents<00:04:53.580> going<00:04:53.790> if<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.150> makes<00:04:54.570> sense<00:04:54.750> so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
currents going if that makes sense so

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.530 
currents going if that makes sense so
like<00:04:55.770> as<00:04:56.040> i<00:04:56.190> do<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.639> way<00:04:56.850> they<00:04:57.060> all<00:04:57.210> go<00:04:57.389> up

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
like as i do it this way they all go up

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.320 
like as i do it this way they all go up
apart<00:04:57.900> from<00:04:58.050> one<00:04:58.230> so<00:04:58.830> i<00:04:58.860> go<00:04:59.130> even<00:04:59.820> further<00:05:00.000> in

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
apart from one so i go even further in

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.550 
apart from one so i go even further in
place<00:05:00.510> another<00:05:01.490> one<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:03.320> so<00:05:04.320> if<00:05:04.410> this

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
place another one here so if this

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.170 
place another one here so if this
happens<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.160> just<00:05:05.250> keep<00:05:05.940> placing

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
happens to you just keep placing

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.200 
happens to you just keep placing
redstone<00:05:06.750> repeaters<00:05:07.169> know<00:05:07.440> sort<00:05:07.830> now<00:05:08.730> you<00:05:08.790> can

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
redstone repeaters know sort now you can

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.270 
redstone repeaters know sort now you can
just<00:05:09.450> decorate<00:05:10.110> it<00:05:10.320> however<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.010> want<00:05:11.160> you

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
just decorate it however you want you

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.310 
just decorate it however you want you
can<00:05:11.400> leave<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.700> like<00:05:11.730> that<00:05:11.880> but<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.540> chose<00:05:13.080> to

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
can leave it like that but I chose to

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.320 
can leave it like that but I chose to
fill<00:05:13.620> in<00:05:13.740> these<00:05:13.890> little<00:05:14.190> games<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:15.090> make<00:05:15.180> it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
fill in these little games to make it

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.310 
fill in these little games to make it
look<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.540> bit<00:05:15.570> nicer<00:05:20.090> get<00:05:21.090> more<00:05:21.330> cobble<00:05:21.720> fill<00:05:22.229> it

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
look a bit nicer get more cobble fill it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.690 
look a bit nicer get more cobble fill it
up<00:05:22.410> it's<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.860> fill<00:05:23.100> it<00:05:23.190> up<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:26.130> guards<00:05:26.520> if<00:05:26.610> you

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
up it's not fill it up and guards if you

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.440 
up it's not fill it up and guards if you
didn't<00:05:26.940> know<00:05:27.060> already<00:05:27.090> um<00:05:27.510> when<00:05:29.450> creative
