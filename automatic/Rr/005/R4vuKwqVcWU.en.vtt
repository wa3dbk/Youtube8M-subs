00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.880
 hello friends level a sandbox stein 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.610
 photograph the place where we teach you 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.349
 digital photography from scratch 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.029
 and this is the third chapter we will see the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 opening operation let's start 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.899
 the opening is related to the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.230
 diaphragm mechanism that have all the 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.989
 objectives internally 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.750
 the opening is a value that is indicated 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.370
 in efe numbers on the screen you see all 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.010
 the possible values â€‹â€‹that we can choose 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.290
 for opening according to the objective that 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.860
 let's place we will have some of these or 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.019
 all as you see each opening value 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 makes the diaphragm open more or 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.769
 less and this will cause more or less 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.589
 light to the objective and therefore to the photo 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.350
 for example if we have a f5 with 6 and 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.380
 we change to that 8 we will have decreased a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 step of light because in f8 enter the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.550
 half of light that came into f 5 with 6 if 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.560
 we change from f 5.6 to efe five habremos 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.899
 stepped up the posts that in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.810
 f5 will enter double the light that entered 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.180
 in f 5 with 6 so in conclusion 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.179
 we have to greater the number of fair 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.850
 opening less light in the photo and less 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.090
 the number f more light we will have in our 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.090
 Photo 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 let's see an example 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.780
 with opening 10 and others with opening 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.780
 we will check the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 well let's take the first picture with 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 opening 9 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 we change opening to this 10 and we do 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.329
 the second photo 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.110
 we change the opening to efe 11 and we do 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 the third photo 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.030
 if we look at the first photo, especially 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.220
 in the clouds when using aperture f 9 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.340
 we noticed that there is enough light in which 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 has f10 there is less light and I already started 11 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.560
 we see how light decreases noticeably 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.510
 the use of higher opening values 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.430
 or minors is also associated with others 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 concepts such as focus and depth of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.510
 field that we will cover in other chapters 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 this has been everything I hope you liked 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.980
 and see you in a next chapter of 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.980
 pits paint photography 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 ah
