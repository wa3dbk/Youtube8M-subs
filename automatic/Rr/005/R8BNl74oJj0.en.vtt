 About Manda, there may be too much to say to me, it makes me proud. 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.062
 It is a home, it is a dream of success is to gain confidence

 Realize the land of dreams. 

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.014
 it is 

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:20.098
 A place that is both global and local. 

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:23.180
 It is an outstanding place and I think 

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.049
 It also has some radicality. Here we can linger in knowledge. 

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.100
 Here is work, teaching, and research. 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.260
 A good place is where I have long dreamed of. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.325
 Manchester University talented people

 It is a powerful and well-targeted teaching and research institution. 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.465
 It is a beacon of interdisciplinary research. 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.150
 Here, I feel that I am being cherished 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.089
 It is constantly improving, pursuing equality and promoting humanity 

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.089
 And rich in creation. 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.090
 The learning environment here is excellent. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.114
 It is knowledge, it is learning 

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:07.079

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.122
 It is the heart of Manchester. It is my home 

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:14.114
 I grew up here. This is a vibrant and exciting community 

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:19.045
 Students and faculty members are on this vibrant, incredible campus 

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.069
 In a great city and a source of modern city Manchester 25 00:01:22,169 --&gt; 00:01:22,161 

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.133
 “University is an academic community and its value lies in fostering the pursuit of truth.” 2004-2010 Manchester University President Alan Gilbert 

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:34.033
 Manchester University 

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:37.122
 I am a proud Manchester. 

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:41.037
 My first day in high school 

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:44.129
 Our class teacher gave the following speech: Children, Manchester 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:48.038
 Is the city of the charter 

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:52.047
 It is the city of feminism that is a city of free trade and a city where the Peter Lu massacre took place. 

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:55.696
 Manchester University in the history of thought 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.208
 The first place here is the master like Yun 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.360
 Such as Alan Turing, Bernard Lovell, Rutherford and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.565
 Schuster. Right here, John Dalton 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.730
 Proposed atomic theory is also here 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.164
 Hans Geiger, James Chadwick and other nuclear pioneers 

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:17.913
 Receive academic training and conduct academic research. This is a great city 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.389
 It has a long history and is advancing with the times. 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.760
 Manda is the outstanding university in this great city. 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.097
 For a long time, Manda’s success for the city 

00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:33.178
 Made an incalculable contribution. No positive support and contribution from Manda 

00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:34.141
 we 

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:38.136
 It is impossible to develop Manchester into 

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:42.133
 What we imagined. 

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.101
 I came here because 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.076
 I am here with the atmosphere and the spirit of the college 

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:51.090
 Attracted. Cancer research is a priority discipline 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.178
 Because, first of all, cancer is faced by society. 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.210
 Big problem; secondly Manchester University 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.960
 And the National Health Service (NHS) 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.580
 Cancer Research Association and universities willing to work together to overcome cancer problems 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.142
 Have a good interaction so 

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:10.115
 Outstanding achievements in cancer research. 

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:15.089
 Manchester invests heavily in nuclear energy research facilities 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.528
 What I value most is Manda's determination and commitment in the field of nuclear energy. 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.170
 Manda and industry have close ties and are committed to working with industry 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.025
 Committed to attracting the world's top scientists. 

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.604
 There is too much worthwhile cooperation with the University of Manchester. 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:29.901
 Something cherished 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.120
 My wife and I have been to many local communities in distant countries. 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.911
 The policies implemented there 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.060
 Improving the lives of locals 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.405
 And those policies are derived from the University of Manchester. 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.502
 Brooks World Poverty Research Institute 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.520
 Research results 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.078
 The most precious here 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.156
 Academic freedom 

00:03:56.056 --> 00:04:00.069
 And exciting collaborators. Development in the field of graphene in Manda 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.093
 Very quickly, the reason behind it is the University of Manchester 

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:06.982
 Is the largest and most successful person in different scientific fields 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.600
 The university that gathered together is their collective push 74 00:04:11,700 --&gt; 00:04:11,062 Graphene research is very fast 

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:15.914
 And in different directions 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.740
 development of. Biotechnology is at the heart of sustainable production processes 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.123
 And definitely the direction of the future, we are currently getting rid of 

00:04:25.023 --> 00:04:29.038
 The dependence of the oil industry, biotechnology will give birth 

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:32.061
 New chemicals, new materials and bioenergy. 

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.069
 As humans continue to advance biotechnology 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.086
 It will also become a critical research area. Talent 

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:41.154
 Is the most valuable asset of the university 

00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:45.126
 Including our employees, our students, and our many external stakeholders. 

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:50.107
 We have invested a lot of time and money to help them realize their potential. 

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:54.056
 Per year 

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:57.115
 Thousands of students at the University of Manchester 

00:04:58.015 --> 00:05:01.053
 They will make a great contribution to the vast world 

00:05:01.153 --> 00:05:04.089
 I think the unique characteristics of Manchester University students lies in 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.108
 "excellence" academic excellence 

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.047
 Manda is talking to students 

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:13.636
 Provide professional education 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.113
 Extremely outstanding, and it also allows students to grow up 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.611
 Get a full-scale experience in a cosmopolitan city. 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.725
 Manda helped me develop a sense of belonging 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.080
 This is the gathering place for talents from all over the world. 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.021
 They are here to study together and live together. I can work with well-known scientists and 

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:36.250
 People from different cultural backgrounds 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:39.502
 Engage, which allows us to build a bond between 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:40.135
 Help me in the future. 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.110
 Academically, Manda provided me with everything I needed; in sports. 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.440
 I came here with the ambition to participate in the Olympics. 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.633
 I have won 5 world championships, I hope I will have one day 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.120
 Won the Olympic Olympic champion. 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.964
 Social responsibility is the three core goals of the University of Manchester 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:04.248
 one. We work very hard to change 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.865
 The world around us. 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.270
 It is not only a slogan that Manda talked about when he talked about social participation. 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.122
 Not just some 

00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:14.090
 cliche. They are for the community and society 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.106
 Development is full of passion. I am very proud to be one of them. 

00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:22.093
 Manda and the college we have worked with 

00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:26.112
 Is our outstanding partner, we belong to a network at any time, as long as we have any projects 

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:27.074
 Manda is in 

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:30.143
 Our project area 

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:35.050
 Supporting us, Manda is definitely the best university. 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.070
 It has excellent research and also provides students with a great learning experience. 

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:46.015
 It's a great city that sets our community apart
