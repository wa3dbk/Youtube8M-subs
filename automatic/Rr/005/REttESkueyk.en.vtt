as<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.160> look<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.489> souls<00:02:14.760> here

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
as we take a look at the souls here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
as we take a look at the souls here
again<00:02:15.599> just<00:02:15.870> white<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.069> black<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.670> Nike

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
swoosh and then we have that same kind

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.420
