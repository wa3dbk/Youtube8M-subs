outside the earth you know I feel like

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.060 
outside the earth you know I feel like
that's<00:02:42.380> what<00:02:42.560> inspired<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.100> jacket<00:02:44.800> but<00:02:45.800> you

that's what inspired this jacket but you
know<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.550> video<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.150> mean<00:02:47.360> anyone<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.840> make

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
know just a video I mean anyone can make

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.540 
know just a video I mean anyone can make
a<00:02:47.990> video<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.530> special<00:02:48.830> effects<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.340> so

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
a video and special effects are so

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.740 
a video and special effects are so
common<00:02:49.970> these<00:02:50.090> days<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.420> mean<00:02:50.600> an

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
common these days I mean an

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
common these days I mean an
eight-year-old<00:02:51.290> kid<00:02:51.350> can<00:02:51.740> whip<00:02:52.070> up<00:02:52.220> something

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
eight-year-old kid can whip up something

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.010 
eight-year-old kid can whip up something
on<00:02:52.580> iMovie<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.480> looks<00:02:53.630> like<00:02:53.690> that's<00:02:53.870> what

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
on iMovie so it looks like that's what

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.710 
on iMovie so it looks like that's what
happened<00:02:54.320> -<00:02:54.410> yeah<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.760> he<00:02:56.120> was<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.390> was<00:02:56.600> in

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
happened - yeah yeah he was it was in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.630 
happened - yeah yeah he was it was in
intro<00:02:57.170> class<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.650> think<00:02:57.709> yeah

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
intro class I think yeah

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.590 
intro class I think yeah
so<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.970> would<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.270> would<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.390> take<00:02:59.570> for

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so what would it what would it take for

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.360 
so what would it what would it take for
you<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.870> actually<00:03:00.140> believe<00:03:03.370> testable

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
you to actually believe testable

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.160 
you to actually believe testable
repeatable<00:03:04.550> evidence<00:03:05.420> peer-reviewed

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
repeatable evidence peer-reviewed

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.110 
repeatable evidence peer-reviewed
scientific<00:03:06.680> research<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.610> mean<00:03:07.820> like<00:03:07.940> I

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
scientific research but I mean like I

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.150 
scientific research but I mean like I
agree<00:03:08.420> with<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.290> also<00:03:09.590> think<00:03:10.070> that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
agree with you of like I also think that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.790 
agree with you of like I also think that
it<00:03:10.640> would<00:03:10.820> be<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.630> know<00:03:11.660> not<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.230> far<00:03:12.560> off<00:03:12.590> to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
it would be you know not that far off to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.870 
it would be you know not that far off to
believe<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.220> there's<00:03:13.400> something<00:03:13.610> out<00:03:13.850> there

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
believe that there's something out there

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.180 
believe that there's something out there
I<00:03:14.060> mean<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.330> universe<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:15.020> very<00:03:15.260> big<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.890> we

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
I mean the universe is very big and we

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.070 
I mean the universe is very big and we
are<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.520> small<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.720> think<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.930> we're

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
are very small so to think that we're

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.210 
are very small so to think that we're
the<00:03:18.200> only<00:03:18.350> intelligent<00:03:18.530> life<00:03:18.920> out<00:03:19.160> there

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the only intelligent life out there

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.190 
the only intelligent life out there
doesn't<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:20.030> seem<00:03:20.239> likely<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.930> me<00:03:21.019> either

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
doesn't really seem likely to me either

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140 
doesn't really seem likely to me either

thing that matters I mean there's been

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.479 
thing that matters I mean there's been
existence<00:04:08.650> billions<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.860> years<00:04:10.100> before<00:04:10.459> us

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
