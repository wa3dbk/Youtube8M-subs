00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.539 
we're going to just mix this slowly
until<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.840> nice<00:02:50.049> mixture<00:02:50.220> as<00:02:51.220> soon<00:02:51.430> as

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
until we get a nice mixture as soon as

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.060 
until we get a nice mixture as soon as
this<00:02:51.670> becomes<00:02:52.090> well<00:02:52.420> incorporated<00:02:52.989> our<00:02:53.769> last

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
this becomes well incorporated our last

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.710 
this becomes well incorporated our last
thing<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.579> is<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:54.970> pour<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.360> our<00:02:55.540> hot

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
thing to do is just pour in our hot

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.830 
thing to do is just pour in our hot
water<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:58.150> we're<00:02:58.269> going<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.420> go<00:02:58.570> right

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
water and then we're going to go right

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.860 
water and then we're going to go right
into<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.140> pans<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:01.180> I'll<00:03:01.299> continue<00:03:01.600> mixing

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
into the pans so I'll continue mixing

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.300 
into the pans so I'll continue mixing
this<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.290> I'll<00:03:02.350> be<00:03:02.440> back<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.829> second<00:03:03.190> before

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
this so I'll be back in a second before

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.190 
this so I'll be back in a second before
I<00:03:03.519> add<00:03:03.730> my<00:03:03.940> hot<00:03:04.150> water<00:03:06.840> mmm<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.019> smells

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
I add my hot water mmm that smells

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.180 
I add my hot water mmm that smells
really<00:03:08.709> good

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.790 

now<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.430> go<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.550> little<00:03:14.700> faster<00:03:15.180> I'm<00:03:15.800> pretty

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
now we can go a little faster I'm pretty

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.410 
now we can go a little faster I'm pretty
well<00:03:16.980> incorporated<00:03:17.580> most<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> didn't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
well incorporated most of it I didn't

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.770 
well incorporated most of it I didn't
want<00:03:18.450> any<00:03:19.129> dust<00:03:20.129> flying<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.819> from<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.450> cocoa

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
want any dust flying up from the cocoa

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.559 
want any dust flying up from the cocoa
powder<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> just<00:03:23.730> want<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.209> really

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
powder so I just want to get this really

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.540 
powder so I just want to get this really
well<00:03:24.750> incorporated<00:03:24.920> before<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.040> add<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.400> our

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
well incorporated before we add in our

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.550 
well incorporated before we add in our
hot<00:03:27.000> water

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.100 

all<00:03:34.220> right<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.610> looks<00:03:34.730> good<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.270> I<00:03:35.930> was

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
all right that looks good so I was

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.780 
all right that looks good so I was
mixing<00:03:36.470> there<00:03:36.680> maybe<00:03:36.860> about<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.220> total<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
mixing there maybe about a total of a

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.880 
mixing there maybe about a total of a
minute<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.900> we'll<00:03:39.020> just<00:03:39.140> take<00:03:39.290> our<00:03:39.440> water<00:03:39.620> now

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
minute so we'll just take our water now

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.880 
minute so we'll just take our water now
we're<00:03:40.160> going<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> pour<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:42.770> is

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
we're going to pour this in and this is

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.290 
we're going to pour this in and this is
going<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.100> make<00:03:43.280> very<00:03:44.470> wet<00:03:45.470> batter<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:47.060> you're

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
going to make very wet batter but you're

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.670 
going to make very wet batter but you're
going<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.450> see<00:03:47.660> our<00:03:47.780> final<00:03:48.140> product<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.620> going

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
going to see our final product is going

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.920 
going to see our final product is going
to<00:03:48.830> be<00:03:48.890> very<00:03:49.250> very<00:03:49.580> beautiful<00:03:50.360> nice<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:50.870> moist

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.090 

so<00:03:56.930> I'll<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.170> let<00:03:57.319> this<00:03:57.470> go<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.920> little

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
so I'll just let this go for a little

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.470 
so I'll just let this go for a little
bit<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.400> I'll<00:03:58.459> be<00:03:58.580> back<00:03:58.700> in<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.940> second<00:04:01.480> all

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
bit and I'll be back in a second all

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.930 
bit and I'll be back in a second all
right<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:02.810> I've<00:04:02.900> been<00:04:03.050> mixing<00:04:03.200> for<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.709> good<00:04:04.520> 30

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
right so I've been mixing for a good 30

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.390 
right so I've been mixing for a good 30
seconds<00:04:05.450> or<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.950> looks<00:04:07.130> great

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.490 

so<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.459> see<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.790> mixture<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.500> pretty

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
so you see this mixture is pretty

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680 
so you see this mixture is pretty
liquidy<00:04:14.709> don't<00:04:15.489> worry<00:04:15.670> about<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:16.510> going
