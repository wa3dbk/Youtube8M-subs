00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:12.900
 so after inside the nozzle from 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 we disassemble it we remove rezinochki 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 sealing and selling can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.320
 rinse in two ways do not remove 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.829
 reticulum it is placed nozzles and 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.820
 replacement nets now we will 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.930
 you can not change the mesh 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.730
 rinse by moving this adapter 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:56.600
 thousand percent 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:56.600
 who fits nicely here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.019
 after which we wear a balloon 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.479
 our adapter and here we connect 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.580
 plus or minus 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:18.000
 contacts or else I will do it 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:22.100
 so the mesh heal wrung them 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.100
 self-tapping screw shallow 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:48.860
 We understand here and so, see all 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 mesh is sounding inside us and this 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 adapter 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.860
 just dragging in here, that's all 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.120
 connect the nozzle plus or minus 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:49.799
 give find a beard 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.840
 this way we clean the nozzles 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.849
 replace injectors 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.099
 here we got old nets as you 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:35.930
 see not very dirty red bloom 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:41.329
 gum all old frayed mesh 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:47.959
 extracted insert new try not to 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:52.459
 pretty hard to not like this here 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:56.169
 the way they press the net and the same 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.169
 the thing on all four injectors 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
 nets we have all inserted pictures 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.690
 pure promotions 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:15.639
 Next comes the assembly nozzles and so the collection 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:21.500
 nozzle rings new rings 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:25.720
 this is all we have old goes for ejection but u 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.220
 we are such ringlets on this time 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.960
 the usual set of black and red 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.520
 did not take unfortunately those of the store 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 the ring needs to be lubricated previously 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.320
 before installing it for this we 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.740
 use 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.740
 good oil is not necessary to work 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.819
 your little ring and dress it up
