00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.880
 to remove water from your car has 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.300
 three very simple groups 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.100
 the first one is by the radiator itself 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.460
 some models have a kind of 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.300
 tap where you run and it lets out 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 all system water 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.399
 the second is to take off the upper hose 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.519
 of the reservoir and throw the water additive 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.539
 goes up and down the hole and the additive for 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.620
 underside of the reservoir 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.600
 there is another trick that is what I 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.670
 I prefer where you draw the amount of water 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.649
 that I want since I do not always 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.760
 we put pen only a practical and 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.649
 goal 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 for example, there are cars that need 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.259
 60% and additives mixed with water 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.899
 The trick is very simple in any 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.630
 hose and fill with water. 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.119
 the reservoir to the bottom and release the other 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.229
 tip on the floor it sucks all the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 reservoir 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.069
 you can leave the car on 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 briefly to fill the tank 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.350
 while the hose was emptied 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.509
 and to see if the rubbers are 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.109
 It's very simple to dry 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.850
 the 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.140
 they have to be but there are 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.600
 cracks 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.369
 if it is crispy as if it were a 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 Water and salt speech or crack 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.310
 This is because it is old and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.310
 to be changed
