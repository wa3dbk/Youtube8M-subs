 road markers always estimated of the ease and stability forecasts but 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.870
 mostly 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.680
 the first is the manageability the capacity of

 eye to the highest fold angles differs from all others the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.829
 guaranteed by a solid chassis of car result very forward 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.119
 however excellent distribution of the masses great balance of the suspensions

 these conditions the front digger story seems almost to have the event 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.490
 he never misses an ascent always precise what it is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.400
 another of the strong points of this way that the end 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.570
 electronic braking oddioo atala bien you see the control unit that shares the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 braking force between front and rear 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.279
 back we find a very very beautiful twilight disc called vs cause 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.579
 you pay leaves again many miur and back real braking force 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.669
 a chalkboard number works for me 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.439
 primarily the Milan speed 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.729
 that then the speed with which we wish 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.079
 frank the force that we go to beat a clutch on the valve 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.989
 figc against the ecu manages leaf division between front and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.259
 rear 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.569
 very morning 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.639
 these cases we have tried a great help both on the road tiempo istrana but in 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.089
 particular on wet in the wet on the sunset montenegro 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 from 1200 bike rides on spam

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.099
 fourth gear party fifth gear makes no difference between always acerra bikes 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.729
 same way by maintaining a good full protection forcing to one 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.729
 transfer the exchange. 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.009
 torrent this is really selection according to the needs of the pilot 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.719
 we have on the mood-shimmering desktop block 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.859
 by operating 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.689
 we can switch between two florence maps the sport guide touring stp write one 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:27.959
 bill so much 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.680
 bibs too during 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.459
 in the middle then with the bike in motion instead of the control of the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.389
 traction is managed from a button placed all sport 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.419
 command and traction control and this tgs 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.249
 now we are in mode 1, which is rather invasive, which lets you skate 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.959
 the minimondo 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.589
 on this button located on the left of the strait 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.779
 dragging it we move +32 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:00.259
 this way rear tire does a lot more than beth re-ggraphs the little ones 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.489
 olive trees on the asphalt 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.139
 I take inspiration for a few seconds 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.649
 various eye positions 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.060
 communication works 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.200
 club band also identified by house orange mail makes one think 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.279
 me 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.970
 they are the maximum standing 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.680
 1002 2010 does not officially provide for an entry system 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.810
 in the psp max for the most demanding and for those who want to do 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.410
 sold this motorcycle scheme I think it is essential to be able to manage locking 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.060
 of the rear. arming is as simple as disarming 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.690
 yes just bring the bike on the center stand what I did in this case 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.289
 start the engine 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.900
 decathlon in first gear 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.090
 ok 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.550
 at this point 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.569
 bsnes 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.569
 blink 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.139
 the bike can be removed the michela bs grasshopper will remain fixed 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.529
 in this function 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.569
 therefore difficult environments 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.830
 night is dead usable even blocking the rear this happens 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:23.210
 for the simple reason crosses vs runs photo toned both wheels 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.250
 that is, the front hey rear is monitors their station insulation 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.779
 milan Central 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:36.129
 at this point how much the bike costs on the central stand, the control unit reads 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.779
 a decisive difference video passion between front and rear. think china 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.189
 we have a successor error reading info none of the tectonics that is 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.529
 auto off
