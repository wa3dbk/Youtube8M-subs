I'm<00:03:19.250> sure<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.669> great<00:03:19.940> but<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:20.660> spend<00:03:21.260> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I'm sure is great but you spend a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.970 
I'm sure is great but you spend a
hundred<00:03:21.980> bucks<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:22.699> get<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.180> your<00:03:23.359> bags

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
hundred bucks and you get all your bags

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.110 
hundred bucks and you get all your bags
basically<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.430> don't<00:03:25.549> even<00:03:25.790> know<00:03:25.910> if<00:03:26.000> they

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
basically you don't even know if they

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.800 
basically you don't even know if they
all<00:03:26.269> fit<00:03:26.540> yet<00:03:26.810> or<00:03:26.930> not<00:03:27.049> but<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.760> don't<00:03:29.359> think<00:03:29.599> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
all fit yet or not but I don't think the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.589 
all fit yet or not but I don't think the
Gator<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.319> sturdy<00:03:30.889> as<00:03:31.280> protection<00:03:32.030> racket

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
Gator is a sturdy as protection racket

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.970 
Gator is a sturdy as protection racket
and<00:03:33.579> another<00:03:34.579> thing<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.090> these<00:03:35.540> bags<00:03:35.810> are<00:03:36.139> 100

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
and another thing is these bags are 100

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.339 
and another thing is these bags are 100
percent<00:03:37.280> better<00:03:37.519> because<00:03:38.000> they<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.750> the

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
percent better because they have the the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.710 
percent better because they have the the
fleece<00:03:39.620> lining<00:03:40.069> inside<00:03:40.569> ok<00:03:41.980> yeah<00:03:43.569> it's<00:03:44.569> not

50 bucks so I mean I didn't get it but I

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.670 
50 bucks so I mean I didn't get it but I
got<00:04:04.190> that's<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.790> price<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.269> they<00:04:05.419> work<00:04:05.680> so

got that's the price that they work so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.599 
got that's the price that they work so
you<00:04:07.159> know<00:04:07.310> spinning<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:09.799> it's<00:04:10.010> about<00:04:10.250> twice

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
you know spinning that it's about twice

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.599 
you know spinning that it's about twice
as<00:04:10.849> much<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.239> Gator<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:12.229> you<00:04:12.500> get<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:13.310> much

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.830 
as much as Gator but you get that much
better<00:04:13.879> quality<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.639> think<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:17.000> had<00:04:17.269> this

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
better quality and I think I had this

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.589 
better quality and I think I had this
protection<00:04:18.409> racket<00:04:18.889> in<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.130> head<00:04:19.340> or<00:04:19.940> about<00:04:20.299> in

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
protection racket in a head or about in

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.600 
protection racket in a head or about in
the<00:04:20.900> same<00:04:21.199> you<00:04:21.590> know<00:04:21.709> quality<00:04:22.099> level<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:23.560> cost

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the same you know quality level and cost

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.110 
the same you know quality level and cost
so

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.300 
so
you<00:04:26.449> know<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.900> would<00:04:27.380> recommend<00:04:27.800> either<00:04:27.949> one

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
know if you're touring or something you

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.830

yeah<00:04:50.840> whatever<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.860> think<00:04:52.100> these<00:04:52.250> are

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
yeah whatever but I think these are

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.610 
yeah whatever but I think these are
actually<00:04:52.850> more<00:04:53.060> convenient<00:04:53.479> because<00:04:54.260> they

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
actually more convenient because they

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.070 
actually more convenient because they
have<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.979> little<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.580> know<00:04:55.870> handle<00:04:56.870> on<00:04:56.960> the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
side here and it is just sewn into it

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.029 
side here and it is just sewn into it
like<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.690> backpack<00:05:02.990> or<00:05:03.440> something<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.889> know
