00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
is about 33 centimeters width if you're

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.199 
is about 33 centimeters width if you're
going<00:03:17.769> from<00:03:17.950> hair<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.280> shoulder<00:03:19.030> you're

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
probably talking about 14 inches or 36

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.800 
probably talking about 14 inches or 36
37<00:03:23.140> centimeters<00:03:23.590> alright<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> very

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
37 centimeters alright and it's a very

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.900 
37 centimeters alright and it's a very
nice<00:03:25.959> piece<00:03:26.400> doesn't<00:03:27.400> take<00:03:27.580> up<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.760> lot<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
nice piece doesn't take up a lot of

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.430 
nice piece doesn't take up a lot of
space<00:03:28.180> because<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.660> bottom<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> base<00:03:29.230> of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
space because the bottom of the base of

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800 
space because the bottom of the base of
it<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.620> actually<00:03:30.040> smaller<00:03:30.820> than<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.090> hair<00:03:31.299> so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
it is actually smaller than the hair so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.090 
it is actually smaller than the hair so
as<00:03:31.900> long<00:03:31.989> as<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.140> have<00:03:32.290> somewhere<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.830> put<00:03:32.920> it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
as long as you have somewhere to put it

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.350 
as long as you have somewhere to put it
down<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.489> its<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.299> very<00:03:34.480> nice<00:03:34.660> piece<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:36.360> went

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
down on its a very nice piece I went

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.530 
down on its a very nice piece I went
online<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:38.080> see<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.430> value<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.850> this<00:03:39.970> thing<00:03:40.209> I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
online to see the value of this thing I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.259 
online to see the value of this thing I
probably<00:03:41.470> find<00:03:41.769> one<00:03:42.010> person<00:03:42.250> selling<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:43.000> and

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
probably find one person selling it and

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.860 
probably find one person selling it and
they<00:03:43.780> were<00:03:43.840> selling<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.400> $1000<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.870> would

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
they were selling it for $1000 I would

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.690 
they were selling it for $1000 I would
tell<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.320> obviously<00:03:47.860> I<00:03:47.920> can't<00:03:48.190> tell<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.489> what

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
tell you obviously I can't tell you what

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.340 
tell you obviously I can't tell you what
is<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> real<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.630> real<00:03:49.810> estimated

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
is the real this the real estimated

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.990 
is the real this the real estimated
value<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.160> seems<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.549> me<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.820> lot

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
value of this it seems to me that a lot

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720 
value of this it seems to me that a lot
of<00:03:52.030> these<00:03:52.180> statues<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.930> I'm<00:03:53.019> trying<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.730> sell

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
of these statues that I'm trying to sell

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.699 
of these statues that I'm trying to sell
at<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.000> point<00:03:55.329> no<00:03:55.870> one's<00:03:56.079> selling<00:03:56.410> them<00:03:56.680> like

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
at this point no one's selling them like

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.150 
at this point no one's selling them like
people<00:03:57.040> bought<00:03:57.280> them<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.669> they're<00:03:57.760> either

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
people bought them and they're either

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.440 
people bought them and they're either
personal<00:03:58.550> collections<00:03:59.060> are<00:03:59.210> there<00:03:59.330> in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
personal collections are there in

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.520 
personal collections are there in
storage<00:03:59.900> and<00:03:59.990> they're<00:04:00.110> not<00:04:00.200> looking<00:04:00.350> to

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
storage and they're not looking to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.080 
storage and they're not looking to
actually<00:04:00.710> sell<00:04:01.160> them<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:01.580> it's<00:04:01.730> hard<00:04:01.940> to

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
actually sell them so it's hard to

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.880 
actually sell them so it's hard to
determine<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.690> value<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.140> something<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:03.710> is

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
determine the value of something like is

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.940 
determine the value of something like is
is<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.190> worth<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.730> thousand<00:04:05.690> dollars<00:04:05.950> not

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
is this worth a thousand dollars not

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.940 
is this worth a thousand dollars not
