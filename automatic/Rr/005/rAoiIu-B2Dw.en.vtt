00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.360
 rmx company for a long time 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.470
 develops a project 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.670
 alien 2 strongly and already released in prada 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.380
 two lines of 1 imx230 paid computers 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.680
 three viburnum xenon and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.230
 alter a13 about linux first line 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.340
 developed on the basis of the companyâ€™s processors 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.640
 their freescale them x 233 and presented 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 whether the fee in three forms is maximization 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.680
 and metro imx230 3 equals obse on max 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.810
 different to this serial large set 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.530
 peripherals and a variety of interface 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.030
 connectors which naturally led to 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.570
 increase the size of the board 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.690
 So let's take a closer look at the device 1 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.740
 paid computers heart boards 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 is as already mentioned processor and 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.939
 we are with 233 district 90 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.579
 926 jay with an operating frequency of 454 megahertz 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.270
 and 64 mega bytes of ram is located nearby 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.409
 microcircuit 2 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 512 megabits of memory all free 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.260
 microcontroller ports are derived at 4 in 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.710
 the connector also has a proprietary 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.110
 universal connector Erick stick on the board 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.650
 100 megabits are also present 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.500
 ethernet connector two usb connectors and slot 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.260
 under sd card 2 audio jacks 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.940
 and composite video power connector 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.650
 It is carried out from a source of constant 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.970
 voltages from 9 to 16 volts in addition 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.540
 the possibility of power from 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.730
 3.3 volt battery 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.320
 reduced mode 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.450
 normal power consumption 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.480
 This connector can be used as 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.430
 charger board developers 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.560
 have also provided the opportunity 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.550
 in-circuit debugging programming 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.360
 through connectors 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.610
 on end and with someone else it remains to add that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.090
 as an operating system 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.190
 proposed by devin but lovers can 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.710
 stop and. 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.500
 from syria channels and other software to 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.940
 comparing with the famous on the size 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 imx230 processor 3 inferior as 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.620
 megahertz so in megabytes but 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.230
 developers at lemax believe that 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.780
 their brainchild has several advantages 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.240
 first about linux on is 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.700
 fully open platform including 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.610
 hardware and software 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.520
 that means you have access to 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.760
 all cad files and you can use 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.580
 them for personal or commercial projects 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 also advantages are industrial 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.740
 operating temperature range from -25 to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.470
 plus eighty five degrees 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.209
 celsius and finally processor size 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 made in the body of the bug 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.050
 which greatly complicates their use 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.940
 small companies 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.800
 and the imx230 3 processor in the tower 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.010
 Still, you can solder at home 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.800
 conditions so they offer 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.940
 consider the size of advanced gadgets 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.190
 olimp hay 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.560
 A good choice for commercial 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.560
 projects and for creative and part
