 hello how about youtube people i'm pepe 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.629
 RodrÃ­guez once again with a new video 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.500
 tutorial on how to build a bathtub 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:14.500
 and a sink then for mini fix 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
 let's start 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.619
 to start with the bath tub 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.430
 first we are going to need this piece 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.869
 large flat in blue to which 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.890
 later we are going to put two 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.170
 whites of four well 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.170
 and then 12 3 like this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.210
 from both sides 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.210
 i 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.240
 and then we're going to put two of these 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:55.690
 curved pieces on each side of the tub 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 and finally we finish with two of these 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.520
 to finish the contour of the tub 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.910
 then we are going to put one of these here 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.440
 with your respective quote key and so 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 we have a lego tub 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.260
 the sink is simpler than the tub 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.480
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.270
 get a 2 x 4 cube to which we're going 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.870
 to adhere 2 of 1 x 2 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.870
 in this way 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.550
 then we are going to join two of these pieces 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 grays 1 by 2 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.970
 and we are going to join one of these 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.160
 and the key 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.180
 then we are going to measure this is this way 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 to make the sink we are two of 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.990
 these pieces 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.760
 thus 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.990
 and so we have our sink in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.820
 our bath tub then 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.220
 and to release our tub 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.440
 and the chubby star patricia 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.200
 with answer 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.110
 well in advance thanks for watching this 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.870
