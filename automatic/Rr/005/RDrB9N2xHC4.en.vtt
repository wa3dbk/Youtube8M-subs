 then we will have to accept 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.660
 then live streaming camera that's 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 because, on the other hand, it is good for a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.500
 xbox live vision to activate this 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.330

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240
 link on twitter on your facebook page 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.740
 where you put in a schedule video 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 to show that I was going to do a live 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.180
 and then after ben it's all perfect and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 you have so viewers 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.720
 imagine that I run have left 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.790
 initialization look at the top 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.920
 the bomb was aimed green rovio cons 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.210
 good I will not show you one after 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.670
 you start a party will certainly have a 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.660
 little shift with youtube but let's say 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 that it's always better than nothing 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.700
 I think this tip is for 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.380
 people with no hd pvr and who 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.810
 love to make very, very live videos 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.789
 so very long very intense with the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 viewer so I think it's best for 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.500
 so here you go this video will last a 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.789
 little more than two minutes 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.110
 so I hope we would have liked you 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.010
 but you are a little lake please 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.180
 it's always a pleasure 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.180
 go ciao to the next
