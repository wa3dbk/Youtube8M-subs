00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.240
 best pilot 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.460
 s 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.980
 rather, put us off the other side and get plenty of available energy 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.170
 in a future of scarce hard to win we are in energy 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.670
 At the same time we see that we are dependent on extremely unstable people 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.890
 Regions in uncomfortable areas of the world Rottenburg 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.770
 Keeping the world dependent on the office for as long as possible is important 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 until pace 50 are 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.940
 Once again, one in a hundred Americans will be bored 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 Idea of ​​the problems that are approaching us 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.079
 when and where he is 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.430
 increased unemployment bankrupt poverty starvation 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 experience all of it as he collapses a society 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.720
 They are going to be a whole new world of incredible dimensions 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.970
 want to experience and this a few years away is her son EURid again 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.210
 Niebel is not irritating only a few plants do not renew it every year 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.930
 built 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.330
 moreover, the result of many millions of years is geological development 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.440
 here 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.480
 The BOL largest part of the oil was global warming in two short phases 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.630
 educated 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.169
 of 90 and 150 million years have 50 million 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:15.189
 Eros and Bavaria are an animal and plant which causes the motion to die 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.609
 Sand deposits were compressed and over the years these deposits became 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.080
 more and more squeezed and compacted 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.520
 Over time, they were then cooked in the so-called kitchen on the podium 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.500
 after the organic material was buried at 2000 meters depth 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.620
 it was converted by a chemical reaction in Vöhl 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.379
 that this only happened once in geological history 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.979
 and we consume the stuff kept within one to two centuries 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.429
 Hundreds are 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:58.020
 exactly what he wanted Opel a wrong picture of 59 liters 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.070
 he gives a hundred seats I gallons of petrol costing just over $ 100 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.610
 For the first time the energy of this festival corresponds to the annual 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.210
 Job performance of 12 but sad 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:18.430
 At first, LZB has to work an average of 25,000 hours to get that much energy 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:22.919
 As this one contains nearly 0% of the oil Rose can produce when it does 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.669
 spread out over the ground for a dollar spread over several days 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.829
 So you invest a dollar and get for it 25 thousand hours 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.089
 human work this source of energy is so productive that is practical 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.669
 in vain he is Chief Project 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.660
 Zor Margelow break of the place is not renewable and extremely capital intensive 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.210
 describe the most valuable resource we have ever discovered
