00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.800 
look at what kind of floral density
there<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.880> what<00:02:23.180> type<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.420> different

amazing<00:03:17.079> I<00:03:17.200> think<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.860> puts<00:03:18.250> me<00:03:18.489> at<00:03:18.670> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
amazing I think it puts me at a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.699 
amazing I think it puts me at a
different<00:03:19.239> level<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.470> great<00:03:20.680> to
