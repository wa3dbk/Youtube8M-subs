enemy team is drawing support and they

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.609 
enemy team is drawing support and they
play<00:01:15.720> together<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.170> they're<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> clan

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
coming from with that but it's when you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.580 
coming from with that but it's when you
go<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.479> against<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> full<00:01:39.930> party<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> support

and<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.149> close<00:02:06.420> games<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and when you're in close games like this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.639 
and when you're in close games like this
it<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.729> crucial<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> don't<00:02:09.929> make

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it is a very crucial that you don't make

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.930 
it is a very crucial that you don't make
a<00:02:10.679> misstep<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
a misstep because if you do it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
a misstep because if you do it's
probably<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.810> possibly

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
probably or possibly

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.950 
probably or possibly
could<00:02:13.530> cost<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.010> team<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> game<00:02:14.960> especially

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
could cost you team the game especially

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.560 
could cost you team the game especially
when<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.280> know<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.640> had<00:02:17.730> trophy<00:02:18.030> systems<00:02:18.390> and
