what<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.330> doing<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.289> basically

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
what we're doing to do now is basically

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.049 
what we're doing to do now is basically
we'll<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:33.120> putting<00:00:33.540> holes<00:00:33.829> for<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.059> three

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we'll be putting holes for the three

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
we'll be putting holes for the three
holes<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> colored<00:00:37.079> cartridges<00:00:37.910> any<00:00:38.910> HP

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
holes for the colored cartridges any HP

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.979 
holes for the colored cartridges any HP
will<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:42.360> little

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
will do but we're going to have a little

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
will do but we're going to have a little
bit<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> trouble<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.800> we're<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> use

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
bit of trouble if we're going to use

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150 
bit of trouble if we're going to use
those<00:00:44.989> printers<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> three<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.100> one

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
those printers with a three in one

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.500 
those printers with a three in one
function<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:50.070> cartridge<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
function now in this cartridge here is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
function now in this cartridge here is
usually<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:53.120> more<00:00:54.120> than<00:00:54.320> one<00:00:55.320> hole<00:00:56.000> but

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
usually there more than one hole but

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
usually there more than one hole but
what<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what we are just going to do to that is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
what we are just going to do to that is
to<00:00:59.430> seal<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.699> one<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to seal that one up and then for the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.539 
to seal that one up and then for the
color<00:01:01.829> cartridges<00:01:03.439> there's<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> there's<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
color cartridges there's a there's a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
color cartridges there's a there's a
little<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> plastic<00:01:07.170> there<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
little bit of a plastic there that we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.820 
little bit of a plastic there that we
shouldn't<00:01:09.439> need<00:01:10.439> since<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
shouldn't need since it will the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
shouldn't need since it will the
continuous<00:01:13.830> ink<00:01:14.070> system<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.640> bumped<00:01:15.150> right

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
continuous ink system will bumped right

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.280 
continuous ink system will bumped right
there

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
there

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
there
and<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> sample<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.330> I've

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and this is a sample of what I've

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.550 
and this is a sample of what I've
prepared<00:01:19.549> HP<00:01:20.549> printer<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.180> prepared<00:01:21.750> I'd

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
prepared HP printer that I prepared I'd

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.730 
prepared HP printer that I prepared I'd
be<00:01:22.860> use<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.250> hacksaw<00:01:23.610> drill<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.600> mean<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.530> sorry

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
be use a hacksaw drill I mean I'm sorry

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
be use a hacksaw drill I mean I'm sorry
a<00:01:25.890> hacksaw<00:01:26.520> blade<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:28.579> cut<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:30.390> pieces<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a hacksaw blade and cut some pieces to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
a hacksaw blade and cut some pieces to
that<00:01:31.650> printer<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.540> cut<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that printer and also we're gonna cut a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.999 
that printer and also we're gonna cut a
little<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.970> tab<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.009> from

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
little bit of this tab right here from

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.060 
little bit of this tab right here from
the<00:01:38.130> color<00:01:38.369> part<00:01:39.409> just<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.390> left<00:01:42.390> side<00:01:42.750> tab<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the color part just the left side tab so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
the color part just the left side tab so
that<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> continuous<00:01:46.829> ink<00:01:47.189> system<00:01:47.750> whose

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that the the continuous ink system whose

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.170 
that the the continuous ink system whose
will<00:01:49.170> freely

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.840 

or<00:01:53.930> freely<00:01:54.290> move<00:01:54.440> itself<00:01:54.800> there<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:55.700> won't

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
or freely move itself there so it won't

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.470 
or freely move itself there so it won't
bump<00:01:56.180> anything<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.930> will<00:01:58.030> flatten<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.300> hose

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
bump anything that will flatten the hose

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.790 
bump anything that will flatten the hose
so<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.320> incan<00:02:00.760> continually<00:02:01.760> flow<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:03.500> that's

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
so the incan continually flow so that's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.920 
so the incan continually flow so that's
just<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.160> little<00:02:04.400> bit<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.970> fixing<00:02:05.510> right<00:02:05.690> there

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
just a little bit up fixing right there

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.730 
just a little bit up fixing right there
set<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.560> up<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.720> epoxy<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.560> will

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
set it up so that the epoxy that will

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.060 
set it up so that the epoxy that will
put<00:02:10.310> will<00:02:11.300> seal<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:11.960> out<00:02:12.110> tightly<00:02:12.650> that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
put will seal that one out tightly that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.590 
put will seal that one out tightly that
would<00:02:13.280> mean<00:02:13.520> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.060> be<00:02:14.240> airtight<00:02:14.810> seal

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
would mean going to be airtight seal

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.530 
would mean going to be airtight seal
because<00:02:17.600> as<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.560> all<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:20.030> need<00:02:20.270> to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
because as we all know that we need to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.090 
because as we all know that we need to
have<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.080> good<00:02:22.390> continuous<00:02:23.390> ink<00:02:23.720> system<00:02:24.100> it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
have a good continuous ink system it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.980 
have a good continuous ink system it
should<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.610> airtight<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.360> should<00:02:26.570> be<00:02:26.720> sealed

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
should be airtight it should be sealed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.580 
should be airtight it should be sealed
up<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:29.510> air<00:02:29.720> passes<00:02:30.140> through<00:02:30.170> there

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
up because if air passes through there

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.350 
up because if air passes through there
it<00:02:30.710> won't<00:02:31.180> sucks

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
it won't sucks

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960 
it won't sucks
the<00:02:33.170> inka<00:02:33.740> from<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> attack<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the inka from the attack of the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.020 
the inka from the attack of the
continuous<00:02:35.450> ink<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:40.160> here<00:02:40.610> I'm<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:40.790> using

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
continuous ink so here I'm just using

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.350 
continuous ink so here I'm just using
some<00:02:41.360> local<00:02:41.750> epoxy<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.740> think<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.670> best<00:02:43.850> epoxy

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
some local epoxy I think the best epoxy

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.140 
some local epoxy I think the best epoxy
you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.660> use<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.020> those<00:02:45.230> plastic<00:02:45.830> type

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
you can use is those plastic type

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.000 
you can use is those plastic type
plastic<00:02:47.150> epoxy<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.050> those<00:02:48.230> metal<00:02:48.560> base<00:02:48.740> one

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
plastic epoxy not those metal base one

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.140 
plastic epoxy not those metal base one
just<00:02:49.520> um<00:02:49.730> I'm<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:50.660> using<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.110> metal<00:02:51.380> base<00:02:51.530> one

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
just um I'm just using a metal base one

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.180 
just um I'm just using a metal base one
but<00:02:53.150> plastic<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.870> good<00:02:54.140> guess<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.740> airtight

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
but plastic is good guess it is airtight

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.240 
but plastic is good guess it is airtight
I've<00:02:56.000> been<00:02:56.300> I'm<00:02:56.540> using<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.110> steel<00:02:57.890> filled

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
I've been I'm using this steel filled

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.380 
I've been I'm using this steel filled
epoxy<00:02:58.910> if<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.900> don't<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.350> plastic<00:03:00.650> one

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
epoxy if you don't have a plastic one

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.990 
epoxy if you don't have a plastic one
okay<00:03:02.420> plastic<00:03:02.959> type<00:03:03.200> or<00:03:03.500> silikal<00:03:04.400> epoxy<00:03:04.489> will

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
okay plastic type or silikal epoxy will

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.060 
okay plastic type or silikal epoxy will
be<00:03:05.150> good<00:03:05.330> too

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
be good too

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.300 
be good too
okay<00:03:07.070> we'll<00:03:07.310> be<00:03:07.459> sealing<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.480> one<00:03:08.660> up

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
okay we'll be sealing the that one up

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.830 
okay we'll be sealing the that one up
since<00:03:10.310> there's<00:03:10.610> going<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.270> big<00:03:11.570> hole

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
since there's going to be a big hole

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.590 
since there's going to be a big hole
right<00:03:11.870> there<00:03:12.530> because<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.730> cutting<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:16.600> after

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
right there because of cutting and after

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.370 
right there because of cutting and after
that<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.790> let's<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:19.820> fill<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.360> one<00:03:20.540> little

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
that one let's just fill that one little

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.560 
that one let's just fill that one little
bit<00:03:21.470> part<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.520> changed<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> oil<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.390> have

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
bit part I just changed the oil you have

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.740 
bit part I just changed the oil you have
a<00:03:23.750> bad<00:03:24.020> idea<00:03:24.500> from<00:03:24.680> my<00:03:24.890> camera<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.330> I'm<00:03:26.480> just

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
a bad idea from my camera so I'm just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.330 
a bad idea from my camera so I'm just
inserting<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.350> video<00:03:27.739> audio

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.130 

so<00:03:32.340> after<00:03:32.610> filling<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.629> with<00:03:33.780> epoxy

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
so after filling that one with epoxy

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.259 
so after filling that one with epoxy
that<00:03:34.500> there's<00:03:34.950> uh<00:03:35.010> make<00:03:35.580> sure<00:03:35.610> it's<00:03:35.940> airtight

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that there's uh make sure it's airtight

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.440 
that there's uh make sure it's airtight
again<00:03:37.310> if<00:03:38.310> there<00:03:38.489> are<00:03:38.519> other<00:03:38.790> holes<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.300> can

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
again if there are other holes you can

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.869 
again if there are other holes you can
seal<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.780> one<00:03:40.110> also<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:41.489> only<00:03:41.640> need

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
seal it one also you just only need

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.660 
seal it one also you just only need
three<00:03:42.239> holes<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.050> here<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> frame<00:03:44.459> hook

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
three holes and here is a frame hook

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.870 
three holes and here is a frame hook
frame<00:03:45.420> hook<00:03:45.599> two<00:03:45.780> inches<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.349> bind<00:03:46.880> local

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
frame hook two inches you can bind local

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.300 
frame hook two inches you can bind local
DIY<00:03:48.300> shop<00:03:48.630> make<00:03:48.900> sure<00:03:49.050> it's<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.349> smallest<00:03:49.650> one

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
DIY shop make sure it's the smallest one

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.790 
DIY shop make sure it's the smallest one
or<00:03:50.519> maybe<00:03:51.090> second<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> one<00:03:51.900> small<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
or maybe second to the one small and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.640 
or maybe second to the one small and
we're<00:03:53.010> moving<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.459> one<00:03:53.610> up<00:03:53.730> or<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.110> use

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
we're moving that one up or you can use

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.410 
we're moving that one up or you can use
some<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:57.989> call<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.790> other<00:03:59.790> metal<00:04:00.209> bass

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
some or they call this other metal bass

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.670 
some or they call this other metal bass
parts<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.620> like<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.250> sheet<00:04:02.519> mill<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
parts that is like a sheet mill the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.360 
parts that is like a sheet mill the
purpose<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.580> can<00:04:07.370> correctly

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
purpose of that is you can correctly

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.789 
purpose of that is you can correctly
place<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.880> anchor<00:04:09.720> cause<00:04:10.440> for<00:04:10.709> the
