an<00:00:02.909> update<00:00:03.240> on<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.929> mama<00:00:04.350> monster<00:00:04.560> Rustler<00:00:05.130> as

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
an update on the mama monster Rustler as

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.600 
an update on the mama monster Rustler as
you<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.299> see<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.810> excel<00:00:07.589> wheels<00:00:08.220> have<00:00:08.490> been

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
you can see the excel wheels have been

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.540 
you can see the excel wheels have been
mounted<00:00:09.500> front<00:00:10.500> shock<00:00:10.740> tower<00:00:11.010> were<00:00:11.250> placed

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
mounted front shock tower were placed

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
mounted front shock tower were placed
with<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> STR<00:00:12.450> scene<00:00:12.660> woman<00:00:12.960> again<00:00:13.290> reason<00:00:14.250> I

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
with the STR scene woman again reason I

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.010 
with the STR scene woman again reason I
did<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.880> actually<00:00:15.630> there's<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> little

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
did that is actually there's a little

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.630 
did that is actually there's a little
bit<00:00:16.230> higher<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> shock<00:00:17.010> mounting<00:00:17.400> point

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
bit higher of a shock mounting point

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.170 
bit higher of a shock mounting point
with<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.090> STR<00:00:18.420> C<00:00:18.600> shock<00:00:18.810> tower<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:20.000> allows<00:00:21.000> me

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
with the STR C shock tower and allows me

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120 
with the STR C shock tower and allows me
to<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.449> more<00:00:21.510> shock<00:00:22.140> travel<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.769> how<00:00:22.890> low

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to have more shock travel with how low

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
to have more shock travel with how low
it<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.369> there's<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.420> much<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.619> as

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it is there's not much as it is here as

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.580 
it is there's not much as it is here as
you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.730> already<00:00:27.109> enough<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.410> just

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you can see already enough for all just

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
you can see already enough for all just
on-road<00:00:28.920> use<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.900> me<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
on-road use but I like so that me to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
on-road use but I like so that me to
mount<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.099> few<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> two<00:00:32.880> millimeters

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
mount it up a few like two millimeters

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
mount it up a few like two millimeters
up<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.410> makes<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> big<00:00:34.860> difference<00:00:35.160> in

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
up which which makes a big difference in

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.760 
up which which makes a big difference in
the<00:00:35.309> shocks<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> shocks

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
the shocks as you can see the shocks

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.940 
the shocks as you can see the shocks
don't<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.610> trouble<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
don't have too much trouble as it is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
don't have too much trouble as it is
so<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> difference<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.480> there's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so it did make a difference but there's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
so it did make a difference but there's
nothing<00:00:43.140> yahweh's<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> on

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
nothing yahweh's for for just the on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.840 
nothing yahweh's for for just the on
roll<00:00:44.879> travel<00:00:45.270> anyway<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.039> just<00:00:47.039> put<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> new

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
roll travel anyway so just put the new

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
roll travel anyway so just put the new
spacers<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> shocks<00:00:48.780> by<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.620> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
spacers in the shocks by the way what I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.729 
spacers in the shocks by the way what I
use<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.730> spacing<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.680> instead<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
use actually for spacing is instead of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
use actually for spacing is instead of
field<00:00:53.010> tubing<00:00:53.399> where<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> smush<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
field tubing where can kind of smush and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.639 
field tubing where can kind of smush and
hard<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.379> even<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.149> use<00:00:57.440> plastic<00:00:58.440> ball

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hard to get even I use plastic ball

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.660 
hard to get even I use plastic ball
joints<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.390> Revo<00:01:01.340> just<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
joints from like Revo just like on the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.830 
joints from like Revo just like on the
1/16<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.739> little

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.810 

plastic<00:01:09.840> ball<00:01:10.020> studs<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:11.159> rod<00:01:11.400> ends<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
plastic ball studs and then rod ends I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
plastic ball studs and then rod ends I
usually<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.780> those<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.439> fit<00:01:13.619> perfectly

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
usually I use those they fit perfectly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.300 
usually I use those they fit perfectly
over<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> shot<00:01:15.000> cap<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.479> snug<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.259> then

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
over the the shot cap all snug and then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
over the the shot cap all snug and then
I<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.580> use<00:01:17.939> some<00:01:18.299> pieces<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.049> shock

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I actually use some pieces of shock

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
I actually use some pieces of shock
rebuild<00:01:19.680> kit<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.340> extra<00:01:20.670> millimeter<00:01:21.090> or

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
rebuild kit for an extra millimeter or

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510 
rebuild kit for an extra millimeter or
two<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.810> need<00:01:22.080> works<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:22.950> real<00:01:23.130> nice<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
two that I need works out real nice so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.649 
two that I need works out real nice so
instead<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> field<00:01:24.060> tubing<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
instead of field tubing that's what I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.640 
instead of field tubing that's what I
use<00:01:25.009> works<00:01:26.009> real<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.380> yeah<00:01:28.380> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
use works real good there and yeah so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.929 
use works real good there and yeah so
then<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.890> made<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.189> adjustments<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.729> course

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
then I made some adjustments of course

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.630 
then I made some adjustments of course
on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> camber<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.840> toe<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> they're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
on the camber and toe so that they're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
on the camber and toe so that they're
all<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:32.939> straight<00:01:33.680> as<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.009> see

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
all nice and straight as you can see

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
all nice and straight as you can see
here<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> top<00:01:35.790> view<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.420> still<00:01:36.659> kind<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
here from the top view it still kind of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.240 
here from the top view it still kind of
looks<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:38.070> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
looks if you look at it that way it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.740 
looks if you look at it that way it
looks<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> they're<00:01:39.030> they're<00:01:39.360> cockeyed

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
looks like it they're they're cockeyed

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.510 
looks like it they're they're cockeyed
out<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:41.670> course<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> copper

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
out but of course with the with a copper

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.179 
out but of course with the with a copper
camber<00:01:44.520> gauge<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> they're

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
camber gauge you can see that they're

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.870 
camber gauge you can see that they're
that<00:01:47.189> they're<00:01:49.100> nice<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> straight<00:01:50.640> it's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that they're nice and straight it's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280 
that they're nice and straight it's
actually<00:01:51.149> totally<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:52.049> one

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
actually totally in about about one

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.780 
actually totally in about about one
millimeter<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.549> kind<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
millimeter right there you can kind of

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.440 
millimeter right there you can kind of
see<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.640> sure<00:01:56.850> take

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
see so but they look good for sure take

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
see so but they look good for sure take
definitely<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.110> them<00:01:58.200> low<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> low

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
definitely and get them low to get a low

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.240 
definitely and get them low to get a low
ride<00:01:59.909> height<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.250> ride

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
ride height you can kind of see the ride

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
ride height you can kind of see the ride
height<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.149> there's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
height that was got here the way there's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
height that was got here the way there's
the<00:02:07.290> right<00:02:07.469> height<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.700> bit<00:02:08.879> lower<00:02:09.090> on

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the right height a little bit lower on

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
the right height a little bit lower on
the<00:02:09.899> front<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> had<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.700> kind<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the front so I had a little kind of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.290 
the front so I had a little kind of
slanted

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
slanted

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.600 
slanted
kind<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.690> help<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:13.990> any<00:02:14.260> wheeling<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:15.520> was

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
kind of help with any wheeling that was

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.960 
kind of help with any wheeling that was
kind<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.820> my<00:02:15.970> intentions<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:18.310> like

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
kind of my intentions so it's like like

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.670 
kind of my intentions so it's like like
a<00:02:19.000> millimeter<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.690> two<00:02:19.840> lower<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> front

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
a millimeter or two lower on the front

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.980 
a millimeter or two lower on the front
then<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> back<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.570> ride<00:02:22.750> height

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
then it is on the back on ride height

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.070 
then it is on the back on ride height
then<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.350> was<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> purpose<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.190> there

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
then that was for a purpose right there

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.480 
then that was for a purpose right there
yeah<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.170> looks<00:02:26.350> good<00:02:26.500> though<00:02:26.710> I'm<00:02:26.860> happy<00:02:27.280> with

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
yeah it looks good though I'm happy with

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.860 
yeah it looks good though I'm happy with
the<00:02:27.580> results

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the results

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.410 
the results
it's<00:02:29.650> maybe<00:02:29.890> seen<00:02:30.100> my<00:02:30.220> other<00:02:30.490> video<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:31.030> aka

it's maybe seen my other video the aka

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.440 
it's maybe seen my other video the aka

inside of the Bell cranks tearing
there's<00:02:43.270> if<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.260> kind<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.530> move<00:02:44.650> them<00:02:44.740> around

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
there's if you kind of move them around

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.100 
there's if you kind of move them around
there's<00:02:45.640> slop<00:02:46.060> right<00:02:46.330> there<00:02:46.570> from<00:02:46.900> that

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
there's slop right there from that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.040 
there's slop right there from that
little<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.540> screw<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.690> there<00:02:49.750> you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
little that little screw right there you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.970 
little that little screw right there you
can<00:02:50.170> kind<00:02:50.320> of<00:02:50.380> see<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.620> flopping<00:02:50.920> around

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
can kind of see it flopping around

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.310 
can kind of see it flopping around
besides<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.550> there's<00:02:51.910> no<00:02:52.060> slop<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
besides that there's no slop on the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.280 
besides that there's no slop on the
wheel<00:02:53.530> hardware<00:02:54.010> itself<00:02:54.450> there's<00:02:55.450> there's<00:02:55.960> no

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
wheel hardware itself there's there's no

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.380 
wheel hardware itself there's there's no
slop<00:02:56.740> from<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.160> clicking<00:02:57.520> back<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.700> forth<00:02:57.910> so

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
slop from it clicking back and forth so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.230 
slop from it clicking back and forth so
so<00:02:59.260> that's<00:02:59.470> real<00:02:59.650> nice<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.880> will<00:03:00.970> help<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
so that's real nice that will help of

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.000 
so that's real nice that will help of
course<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.600> stability<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.230> all<00:03:02.350> same<00:03:02.830> thing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
course with stability and all same thing

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.550 
course with stability and all same thing
for<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> rear<00:03:03.460> nice<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.540> free-flowing<00:03:05.140> but

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
for the rear nice and free-flowing but

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.300 
for the rear nice and free-flowing but
but<00:03:05.950> no<00:03:06.130> slop<00:03:07.020> no<00:03:08.020> no<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.530> clicking<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.220> you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
but no slop no no that clicking if you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.620 
but no slop no no that clicking if you
push<00:03:09.490> back<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.910> forth<00:03:10.000> there's<00:03:10.390> none<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.540> that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
push back and forth there's none of that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.180 
push back and forth there's none of that
clicking<00:03:11.160> yet<00:03:12.160> yeah<00:03:12.700> nice<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.450> unbinding

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
clicking yet yeah nice and and unbinding

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.920 
clicking yet yeah nice and and unbinding
one<00:03:15.190> tip<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.460> wanted<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.820> give<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.330> probably

one tip I wanted to give is probably

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.300 
one tip I wanted to give is probably
some<00:03:17.140> people<00:03:17.350> try<00:03:17.500> them<00:03:17.650> out<00:03:17.740> their<00:03:17.890> batteries

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
some people try them out their batteries

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.340 
some people try them out their batteries
and<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:19.540> they<00:03:19.660> want<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.840> mount<00:03:20.020> anything<00:03:20.140> on

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
and if they want to mount anything on

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.840 
and if they want to mount anything on
top<00:03:20.560> including<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.070> speed<00:03:21.280> control<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.700> this

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
top including the speed control on this

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.030 
top including the speed control on this
tray<00:03:22.120> first<00:03:22.990> thing<00:03:23.230> there's<00:03:23.440> two<00:03:23.500> different

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
tray first thing there's two different

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.230 
tray first thing there's two different
size<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.370> these<00:03:24.459> trays<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> lot<00:03:24.970> people<00:03:25.090> don't

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
size of these trays a lot people don't

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.330 
size of these trays a lot people don't
know<00:03:25.420> further<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.560> same<00:03:26.770> version<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
know further of the same version of the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.340 
know further of the same version of the
tray<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.820> not<00:03:28.450> sure<00:03:28.630> which<00:03:28.810> ones<00:03:28.990> new<00:03:29.170> or

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
tray I'm not sure which ones new or

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.600 
tray I'm not sure which ones new or
which<00:03:29.500> ones<00:03:29.709> older<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.250> there's<00:03:30.430> this

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
which ones older but there's this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.000 
which ones older but there's this
version<00:03:30.850> here<00:03:31.360> it's<00:03:32.020> all<00:03:32.140> flat<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> little

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
version here it's all flat it's a little

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.740 
version here it's all flat it's a little
bit<00:03:33.100> bigger<00:03:33.310> it's<00:03:34.120> actually<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.510> little<00:03:34.630> bit

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
bit bigger it's actually a little bit

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.220 
bit bigger it's actually a little bit
higher<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.340> there's<00:03:36.490> actually<00:03:36.850> also<00:03:37.230> this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
higher and there's actually also this

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.590 
higher and there's actually also this
version<00:03:38.530> as<00:03:38.800> well<00:03:39.240> here<00:03:40.240> it's<00:03:40.360> got<00:03:40.480> these

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
version as well here it's got these

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.449

little<00:03:40.810> side<00:03:40.990> bars<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.650> actually<00:03:41.950> sits<00:03:42.250> just

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
little side bars and actually sits just

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.510 
little side bars and actually sits just
a<00:03:42.580> little<00:03:42.850> bit<00:03:42.970> lower<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.540> put<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.840> on

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
a little bit lower when you put it on

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.620 
a little bit lower when you put it on
this<00:03:45.520> one<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.209> see<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.420> one<00:03:46.540> that's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
this one is you can see the one that's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.230 
this one is you can see the one that's
on<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.230> longer<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.700> if<00:03:48.790> your<00:03:48.940> instant

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
on here is longer so if your instant

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.730 
on here is longer so if your instant

you<00:03:50.830> were<00:03:50.920> into<00:03:51.130> mounting<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> just

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
you were into mounting it and it just

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.390 
you were into mounting it and it just
didn't<00:03:52.510> fit<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.020> way<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.230> know<00:03:53.530> some<00:03:54.310> people

didn't fit the way you know some people

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.810 
didn't fit the way you know some people
do<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.820> then<00:03:55.630> if<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.840> use<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:57.100> piece<00:03:57.370> here

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
do it then if you use this piece here

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.760 
do it then if you use this piece here
and<00:03:58.000> then<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.390> actually<00:03:58.600> able<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.110> mount<00:03:59.290> the

able to try to get a view here you're

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.470

trailer<00:04:12.280> flipped<00:04:12.520> around<00:04:12.610> because<00:04:12.940> there's<00:04:13.090> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
trailer flipped around because there's a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.150 
trailer flipped around because there's a
little<00:04:13.330> lip<00:04:13.510> on<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.890> that's<00:04:15.070> right

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.860 

there<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.910> go<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.390> way<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.600> can

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
there you go so that way you can

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.300 
there you go so that way you can
actually<00:04:20.050> kind<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.440> drill<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.739> hole<00:04:20.920> like<00:04:21.070> right

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
actually kind of drill a hole like right

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.180 
actually kind of drill a hole like right
there<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:22.510> then<00:04:23.230> have<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.530> sit<00:04:23.710> there<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.010> hold

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
there and then have it sit there to hold

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.190 
there and then have it sit there to hold
your<00:04:24.430> speed<00:04:24.820> control<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:25.210> top<00:04:25.390> severe<00:04:25.750> no<00:04:26.050> the

nose people have issues with their

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.940 
nose people have issues with their
batteries<00:04:31.780> going<00:04:32.050> underneath<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.650> doesn't

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
batteries going underneath and doesn't

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.380 
batteries going underneath and doesn't
fit<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.430> then<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.610> also<00:04:33.760> don't<00:04:34.030> want<00:04:34.270> to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
fit and then you also don't want to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.100 
fit and then you also don't want to
install<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:35.460> Traxxas<00:04:36.660> battery<00:04:37.660> extender

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110

because<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.770> long<00:04:38.980> pulse<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.640> so<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.790> would

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
because it's a long pulse and so I would

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.710 
because it's a long pulse and so I would
sit<00:04:40.270> too<00:04:40.570> high<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.170> that<00:04:41.410> case<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.580> same<00:04:43.540> things

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
sit too high in that case so same things

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.000 
sit too high in that case so same things
I<00:04:43.810> found<00:04:43.990> here<00:04:44.200> so<00:04:44.320> what<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.440> did<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:44.800> I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
I found here so what I did is this I

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.000 
I found here so what I did is this I
actually<00:04:45.190> used<00:04:46.470> instead<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.530> using<00:04:47.740> that

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
actually used instead of using that

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.540 
actually used instead of using that
let's<00:04:48.190> flip<00:04:48.370> around<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.610> other<00:04:48.730> way<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:50.550> used

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
let's flip around the other way I used

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
let's flip around the other way I used

post which is what I am using here as a
matter<00:05:22.570> of<00:05:22.660> fact<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:22.990> use<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.410> with<00:05:23.650> this<00:05:24.190> one

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
matter of fact I use that with this one

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.810 
matter of fact I use that with this one
and<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:26.530> was<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.710> perfect<00:05:26.980> slide<00:05:27.460> for<00:05:27.730> the

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
battery underneath and then what was

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.130 
battery underneath and then what was
nice<00:05:29.230> was<00:05:29.410> when<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.950> battery<00:05:30.250> cradle<00:05:30.850> on<00:05:30.910> top

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
nice was when the battery cradle on top

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.050 
nice was when the battery cradle on top
it<00:05:32.140> would<00:05:32.440> sit<00:05:33.130> perfectly<00:05:33.310> flat

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
it would sit perfectly flat

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.520 
it would sit perfectly flat
I<00:05:34.090> know<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.420> actually<00:05:34.690> when<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:34.840> switched<00:05:35.410> it

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
I know it's actually when I switched it

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.980 
I know it's actually when I switched it
out<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.830> other<00:05:35.950> one<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:37.450> one<00:05:37.690> here

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
out to the other one that this one here

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.050 
out to the other one that this one here
actually<00:05:38.170> sits<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.530> little<00:05:38.620> bit<00:05:38.740> higher<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.220> so

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
actually sits a little bit higher and so

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.100 
actually sits a little bit higher and so
I'm<00:05:40.150> actually<00:05:40.240> going<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.570> go<00:05:40.660> down<00:05:40.690> probably

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
I'm actually going to go down probably

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.200 
I'm actually going to go down probably
to<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:41.950> three<00:05:42.190> millimeter<00:05:42.370> one<00:05:42.760> and<00:05:42.910> I'll<00:05:43.000> show

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
to a three millimeter one and I'll show

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.810 
to a three millimeter one and I'll show
you<00:05:43.300> guys<00:05:43.420> this<00:05:44.290> is<00:05:44.410> actually<00:05:44.770> what<00:05:45.730> I'm

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
you guys this is actually what I'm

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.300 
you guys this is actually what I'm
talking<00:05:46.060> about<00:05:46.090> here<00:05:46.450> there's<00:05:47.350> just<00:05:47.530> axial

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
talking about here there's just axial

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.540 
talking about here there's just axial
part<00:05:49.210> one<00:05:50.080> three<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.470> seven<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:51.010> seven<00:05:51.040> point

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
part one three to seven the seven point

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.360 
part one three to seven the seven point
five<00:05:51.760> by<00:05:52.090> six<00:05:52.150> millimeter<00:05:52.720> spacer<00:05:53.340> here<00:05:54.340> I

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
five by six millimeter spacer here I

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.190 
five by six millimeter spacer here I
have<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.640> two<00:05:55.120> millimeter<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.720> then<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:55.960> have<00:05:56.170> a

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
have a two millimeter and then I have a

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.070 
have a two millimeter and then I have a
three<00:05:56.620> millimeter<00:05:56.770> by<00:05:57.160> six<00:05:57.540> spacer<00:05:58.540> so<00:05:58.690> just

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
three millimeter by six spacer so just

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.030 
three millimeter by six spacer so just
like<00:05:59.260> as<00:05:59.380> you<00:05:59.470> can<00:05:59.620> see<00:05:59.710> they're<00:05:59.860> almost

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
like as you can see they're almost

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.030 
like as you can see they're almost
identical<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.270> Traxxas<00:06:01.690> ones<00:06:02.040> except

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
identical to the Traxxas ones except

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.190 
identical to the Traxxas ones except
maybe<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.250> little<00:06:03.490> bit<00:06:03.700> more<00:06:03.820> glossy<00:06:04.060> but<00:06:04.930> I

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
maybe a little bit more glossy but I

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.990 
maybe a little bit more glossy but I
mean<00:06:05.470> if<00:06:05.590> you<00:06:05.770> if<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.580> didn't<00:06:06.760> put<00:06:06.880> them

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
mean if you if you didn't put them

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.430 
mean if you if you didn't put them
side-by-side<00:06:07.180> you'd<00:06:07.870> say<00:06:08.020> they<00:06:08.170> came<00:06:08.350> from

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
side-by-side you'd say they came from

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.610 
side-by-side you'd say they came from
the<00:06:08.560> same<00:06:08.740> place<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:10.110> yeah<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.290> as<00:06:11.410> you<00:06:11.500> can

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
the same place and yeah so as you can

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.020 
the same place and yeah so as you can
see<00:06:11.680> -<00:06:11.920> as<00:06:12.010> well<00:06:12.160> without<00:06:12.460> having<00:06:12.760> to<00:06:12.820> put

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
see - as well without having to put

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.150 
see - as well without having to put
those<00:06:13.120> big<00:06:13.360> long<00:06:13.570> posts<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.770> can<00:06:14.950> take<00:06:15.130> a

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
those big long posts you can take a

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.450 
those big long posts you can take a
3-cell<00:06:15.670> battery<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.950> this<00:06:21.070> thing<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.340> come

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
3-cell battery and this thing to come

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.420 
3-cell battery and this thing to come
out<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.960> you<00:06:23.680> could<00:06:23.860> slide<00:06:24.070> that<00:06:24.250> right<00:06:24.370> in

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
out and you could slide that right in

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.130 
out and you could slide that right in
isn't<00:06:25.060> that<00:06:25.150> fact<00:06:25.390> so<00:06:25.510> I<00:06:25.570> can<00:06:25.750> actually<00:06:25.840> go<00:06:26.110> a

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
isn't that fact so I can actually go a

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.180 
isn't that fact so I can actually go a
little<00:06:26.350> bit<00:06:26.500> lower<00:06:26.650> two<00:06:26.919> or<00:06:27.070> three

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
little bit lower two or three

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.940 
little bit lower two or three
millimeters<00:06:27.370> on

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
millimeters on

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.970 
millimeters on
and<00:06:28.100> then<00:06:28.220> how<00:06:28.370> that<00:06:28.400> sit<00:06:28.820> nice<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:29.300> snug<00:06:29.510> so

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
and then how that sit nice and snug so

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.110 
and then how that sit nice and snug so
if<00:06:30.980> I<00:06:31.100> was<00:06:31.190> going<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:31.370> put<00:06:31.520> my<00:06:31.610> speed<00:06:31.820> control

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
if I was going to put my speed control

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.150 
if I was going to put my speed control
on<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.270> side<00:06:32.450> as<00:06:32.690> a<00:06:32.720> matter<00:06:32.900> of<00:06:32.990> fact<00:06:33.230> with<00:06:33.980> the

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
on the side as a matter of fact with the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.730 
on the side as a matter of fact with the
other<00:06:34.310> one<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:34.790> I<00:06:34.910> put<00:06:35.150> this<00:06:35.300> down<00:06:35.540> and<00:06:36.020> then

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
other one if I put this down and then

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.390 
other one if I put this down and then
isolate<00:06:37.340> another<00:06:38.030> battery<00:06:38.420> on<00:06:38.540> top<00:06:39.130> it's<00:06:40.130> just

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
isolate another battery on top it's just

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.120 
isolate another battery on top it's just
an<00:06:40.790> example<00:06:41.060> it<00:06:41.450> sit<00:06:42.260> it<00:06:42.500> would<00:06:42.650> sit<00:06:42.890> nice<00:06:43.100> and

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
an example it sit it would sit nice and

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.070 
an example it sit it would sit nice and
flat<00:06:43.490> too<00:06:43.970> as<00:06:44.030> well<00:06:44.180> so<00:06:44.300> I<00:06:44.360> could<00:06:44.510> put<00:06:44.690> braces

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
flat too as well so I could put braces

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.840 
flat too as well so I could put braces
around<00:06:45.170> and<00:06:45.560> then<00:06:45.650> it<00:06:46.250> kind<00:06:46.520> of<00:06:46.580> won't<00:06:46.730> be

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
around and then it kind of won't be

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.820 
around and then it kind of won't be
touching<00:06:47.090> I'll<00:06:47.450> probably<00:06:47.630> well<00:06:48.530> I'm<00:06:48.650> not

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
touching I'll probably well I'm not

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.050 
touching I'll probably well I'm not
really<00:06:48.950> sure<00:06:49.190> if<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.370> mount<00:06:49.550> speed<00:06:49.760> control<00:06:50.030> on

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
really sure if I mount speed control on

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.190 
really sure if I mount speed control on
the<00:06:50.150> side<00:06:50.330> I'll<00:06:50.480> do<00:06:50.630> something<00:06:50.840> like<00:06:50.960> that

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
the side I'll do something like that

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.350 
the side I'll do something like that
and<00:06:51.380> then<00:06:51.650> put<00:06:52.010> the<00:06:52.070> proper<00:06:52.370> spacing<00:06:52.670> here<00:06:53.120> so

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
and then put the proper spacing here so

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880 
and then put the proper spacing here so
that<00:06:53.480> it<00:06:53.540> sits<00:06:53.660> flat<00:06:53.960> and<00:06:54.230> then<00:06:54.350> it<00:06:54.470> can<00:06:54.590> strap

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
that it sits flat and then it can strap

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.290 
that it sits flat and then it can strap
them<00:06:54.920> so<00:06:55.220> that<00:06:55.340> are<00:06:55.400> not<00:06:55.520> touching<00:06:55.790> directly

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
them so that are not touching directly

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.860 
them so that are not touching directly
and<00:06:56.510> then<00:06:57.260> put<00:06:58.090> like<00:06:59.090> this<00:06:59.300> and<00:06:59.540> I'll<00:06:59.600> sit<00:06:59.780> on

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
and then put like this and I'll sit on

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.160 
and then put like this and I'll sit on
top<00:07:00.110> or<00:07:00.350> in<00:07:00.890> this<00:07:01.070> situation<00:07:01.930> I'm<00:07:02.930> going<00:07:03.080> to

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
top or in this situation I'm going to

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.300 
top or in this situation I'm going to
see<00:07:03.290> how<00:07:03.350> I'm<00:07:03.410> going<00:07:03.530> to<00:07:03.620> do<00:07:03.770> something<00:07:04.250> like

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
see how I'm going to do something like

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.520 
see how I'm going to do something like
that<00:07:04.370> but<00:07:04.910> forward<00:07:05.600> speed<00:07:06.020> control<00:07:06.350> is<00:07:06.380> going

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
that but forward speed control is going

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.840 
that but forward speed control is going
to<00:07:06.650> sit<00:07:06.830> here<00:07:07.070> then<00:07:07.190> the<00:07:07.310> batter<00:07:07.490> is<00:07:07.640> going<00:07:07.760> to

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
to sit here then the batter is going to

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.760 
to sit here then the batter is going to
go<00:07:07.940> more<00:07:08.090> forward<00:07:08.600> that's<00:07:09.410> guess<00:07:09.560> that's

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
go more forward that's guess that's

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.230 
go more forward that's guess that's
benefit<00:07:10.340> to<00:07:10.430> putting<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:10.700> speakers<00:07:10.970> on<00:07:11.120> the

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
benefit to putting the speakers on the

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.910 
benefit to putting the speakers on the
side<00:07:11.450> as<00:07:11.720> you<00:07:11.870> able<00:07:12.080> to<00:07:12.110> kind<00:07:12.380> of<00:07:12.440> I'm<00:07:12.650> able<00:07:12.860> to
