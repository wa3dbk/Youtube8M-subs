Roberto Ricci in his his mother had

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.310 
Roberto Ricci in his his mother had
worked<00:00:30.890> on<00:00:31.100> along<00:00:31.880> with<00:00:32.090> other<00:00:32.320> Parisian

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
worked on along with other Parisian

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.860 
worked on along with other Parisian
houses<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.860> promote<00:00:34.130> fashion<00:00:34.970> after<00:00:35.240> the<00:00:35.690> war

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
houses to promote fashion after the war

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.560 
houses to promote fashion after the war
and<00:00:36.110> it<00:00:36.230> was<00:00:36.260> making<00:00:36.560> scaled-down<00:00:37.370> models<00:00:38.239> of

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
and it was making scaled-down models of

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.870 
and it was making scaled-down models of
the<00:00:38.900> couture<00:00:39.320> pieces<00:00:39.470> so<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.340> took<00:00:40.640> me<00:00:40.850> to

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
the couture pieces so that took me to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.210 
the couture pieces so that took me to
think<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.450> how<00:00:41.809> it<00:00:41.989> was<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.440> women<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:42.830> Paris

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
think of how it was for women in Paris

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.040 
think of how it was for women in Paris
at<00:00:43.400> that<00:00:43.550> time<00:00:43.820> when<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.090> were<00:00:44.239> wrestling<00:00:44.930> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
at that time when the were wrestling and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.260 
at that time when the were wrestling and
restrictions<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.070> can<00:00:46.280> get<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.880> fabrics

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
restrictions and you can get the fabrics

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.880 
restrictions and you can get the fabrics
you<00:00:47.450> want<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:47.870> think<00:00:47.989> women<00:00:48.290> had<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.650> very

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
you want so I think women had to be very

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.549 
you want so I think women had to be very
creative<00:00:49.210> with<00:00:50.210> their<00:00:50.840> wardrobe<00:00:51.320> and

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
creative with their wardrobe and

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:17.630 
creative with their wardrobe and
basically<00:00:51.980> make<00:00:52.489> make<00:00:52.940> do<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.390> mend

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.530 

I<00:01:22.130> didn't<00:01:23.130> want<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.520> silhouette<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.360> feel

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
I didn't want the silhouette to feel

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
I didn't want the silhouette to feel
retro<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> any<00:01:25.440> way<00:01:25.620> though<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:25.830> was

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
retro in any way though that was

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
retro in any way though that was
important<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
important so it was very much about a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
important so it was very much about a
contemporary<00:01:29.520> woman<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.119> looking<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
contemporary woman but looking to that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:02:11.580 
contemporary woman but looking to that
very<00:01:31.409> road<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.520> departure

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.830 

so<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.769> in<00:02:13.010> fact<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.430> shredded<00:02:13.879> chiffon<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
so that in fact the shredded chiffon and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.229 
so that in fact the shredded chiffon and
then<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.409> was<00:02:15.530> realtor<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.579> like<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.939> idea

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
then it was realtor and I like the idea

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.599 
then it was realtor and I like the idea
that<00:02:17.329> became<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.989> sweater<00:02:18.409> with<00:02:19.010> his<00:02:19.159> still<00:02:19.370> had

its its plows leaves with the tire of
the<00:02:22.189> car<00:02:22.219> that<00:02:22.879> really<00:02:23.590> reflected<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.769> kind

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the car that really reflected the kind

throughout the show where it really kind

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:50.580 
throughout the show where it really kind
of<00:02:38.050> nailed<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.560> concept<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
of nailed the concept I think I think I

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.200 
of nailed the concept I think I think I
pushed<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.980> color<00:02:51.190> palette<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.700> lot<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.150> I

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
pushed the color palette a lot and I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.000 
pushed the color palette a lot and I
introduced<00:02:52.660> some<00:02:52.840> new<00:02:52.870> colors<00:02:53.410> for<00:02:53.620> Nina

Sonia allowed me to use her archive so

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.170 
Sonia allowed me to use her archive so
some<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.130> pieces<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.670> catwalk<00:04:02.000> today

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
some of the pieces on the catwalk today

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.600 
some of the pieces on the catwalk today
were<00:04:02.660> actually<00:04:03.319> he<00:04:03.739> says<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.040> she<00:04:04.190> made<00:04:04.370> ten

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
were actually he says that she made ten

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.759 
were actually he says that she made ten
years<00:04:04.850> ago<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.750> think<00:04:05.810> by<00:04:06.080> using<00:04:06.350> them<00:04:06.680> at

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
years ago and I think by using them at

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.259 
years ago and I think by using them at
Nina<00:04:06.950> Ricci<00:04:07.220> I'm<00:04:07.430> putting<00:04:07.730> them<00:04:07.880> when<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
Nina Ricci I'm putting them when the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.440 
Nina Ricci I'm putting them when the
show<00:04:08.480> gave<00:04:09.230> them<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.980> new<00:04:10.310> life<00:04:10.519> so<00:04:10.940> again<00:04:11.209> it

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
show gave them a new life so again it

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.479 
show gave them a new life so again it
really<00:04:11.480> related<00:04:12.230> back<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:12.920> concept<00:04:13.280> of

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
really related back to the concept of

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.910 
really related back to the concept of
the<00:04:13.549> show

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.080 

leather<00:04:19.920> goods<00:04:20.100> were<00:04:20.370> obviously<00:04:21.000> very

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
leather goods were obviously very

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.630 
leather goods were obviously very
important<00:04:21.810> we<00:04:22.080> did<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.890> was<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> bucket<00:04:23.430> bag

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
important we did a it was a bucket bag

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.440 
important we did a it was a bucket bag
because<00:04:24.390> obviously<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:25.350> know<00:04:25.380> something

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
because obviously you know something

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.470 
because obviously you know something
bucket<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.470> becomes<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.920> bag<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.820> that

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
bucket and it becomes a bag so that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.840 
bucket and it becomes a bag so that
seems<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.930> fit<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.290> but<00:04:31.620> obviously<00:04:32.280> we<00:04:32.460> wanted

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
seems to fit in but obviously we wanted

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.360 
seems to fit in but obviously we wanted
to<00:04:33.060> make<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> feel<00:04:34.140> very<00:04:34.200> luxurious<00:04:34.680> so

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
to make it feel very luxurious so

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.400 
to make it feel very luxurious so
sometimes<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.060> was<00:04:36.150> made<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.540> crocodile<00:04:37.080> and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
sometimes it was made in crocodile and

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.190 
sometimes it was made in crocodile and
we<00:04:37.500> played<00:04:37.740> around<00:04:38.580> with<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.850> lot<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.240> color

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
we played around with a lot of color

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.730 
we played around with a lot of color
combinations<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:42.110> some<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.320> styles<00:04:43.680> it

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
combinations and some of the styles it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.980 
combinations and some of the styles it
was<00:04:43.830> probably<00:04:44.100> hard<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.490> see<00:04:44.670> but<00:04:45.240> inside<00:04:45.720> to

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
was probably hard to see but inside to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.310 
was probably hard to see but inside to
type<00:04:46.680> them<00:04:47.030> as<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.270> lining<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.840> bag<00:04:49.020> so

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
type them as the lining of the bag so

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.230 
type them as the lining of the bag so
you<00:04:49.590> know<00:04:49.950> that's<00:04:50.130> very<00:04:50.220> important<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.090> have

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
you know that's very important to have

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:22.760 
you know that's very important to have
sometimes<00:05:21.169> things<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.290> look<00:05:22.560> really

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
sometimes things that look really

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.400 
sometimes things that look really
terrific<00:05:23.100> on<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.580> runway<00:05:23.910> are<00:05:24.840> often<00:05:25.230> very

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
terrific on the runway are often very

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.950 
terrific on the runway are often very
extreme<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.100> then<00:05:26.370> when<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.610> see<00:05:26.850> them<00:05:27.060> on

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
extreme and then when you see them on

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.280 
extreme and then when you see them on
the<00:05:27.990> street<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:29.720> they<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:30.870> sort<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:31.050> don't

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
the street you they just sort of don't

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.740 
the street you they just sort of don't
click<00:05:31.590> for<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:33.000> think<00:05:33.270> oftentimes

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
click for you and I think oftentimes

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.810

it's<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.320> collections<00:05:34.860> like<00:05:35.130> Amina<00:05:35.550> Rishi

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
it's to the collections like Amina Rishi

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.630 
it's to the collections like Amina Rishi
that<00:05:36.090> are<00:05:36.210> more<00:05:36.500> understated<00:05:37.500> about<00:05:37.740> time<00:05:38.490> to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
that are more understated about time to

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.550 
that are more understated about time to
kind<00:05:38.850> of<00:05:38.880> work<00:05:39.120> better<00:05:39.390> on<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.230> street

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
kind of work better on the street

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.290 
kind of work better on the street
because<00:05:40.860> they<00:05:40.980> sort<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.190> follow<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.700> rules<00:05:41.910> of

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
because they sort of follow the rules of

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:52.140 
because they sort of follow the rules of
our<00:05:42.540> culture<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.260> terms<00:05:43.410> of<00:05:43.590> what's<00:05:43.830> allowed

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.360 

oh<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:55.360> thought<00:05:55.660> it<00:05:55.720> was<00:05:55.860> incredibly<00:05:56.860> pretty<00:05:57.340> I

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
that somehow look so sophisticated it's

00:06:12.850 --> 00:07:28.749 
that somehow look so sophisticated it's
great

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.059 

I<00:07:28.809> mean<00:07:29.809> I<00:07:29.930> think<00:07:30.110> I<00:07:30.229> had<00:07:30.409> a<00:07:30.439> very<00:07:30.650> singular

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:31.069 
I mean I think I had a very singular

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:33.610 
I mean I think I had a very singular
view<00:07:31.400> of<00:07:31.610> what<00:07:31.789> I<00:07:31.819> wanted<00:07:32.270> for<00:07:33.020> the<00:07:33.110> house<00:07:33.259> that

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
view of what I wanted for the house that

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.140 
view of what I wanted for the house that
that's<00:07:33.889> for<00:07:34.129> sure<00:07:34.309> and<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.610> think<00:07:34.639> it's

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
that's for sure and I think it's

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.450 
that's for sure and I think it's
developed<00:07:36.080> and<00:07:36.379> they<00:07:36.439> expanded<00:07:37.009> over<00:07:37.309> that

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
developed and they expanded over that

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.170 
developed and they expanded over that
time<00:07:37.669> but<00:07:37.909> like<00:07:38.029> I've<00:07:38.439> always<00:07:39.879> stayed<00:07:40.879> true<00:07:41.150> to

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.180 
time but like I've always stayed true to

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.079 
time but like I've always stayed true to
my<00:07:41.900> vision<00:07:42.050> but<00:07:42.499> if<00:07:42.979> I<00:07:43.129> think<00:07:43.400> of<00:07:43.550> the<00:07:43.669> first

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:44.089 
my vision but if I think of the first

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:48.489 
my vision but if I think of the first
collections<00:07:44.719> these<00:07:45.050> ones<00:07:46.960> today<00:07:47.960> feels<00:07:48.199> a<00:07:48.349> lot

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:48.499 
collections these ones today feels a lot

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:50.680 
collections these ones today feels a lot
more
