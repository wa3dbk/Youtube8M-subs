crapload<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.720> files<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.259> it's<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.729> pain

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
crapload of files and it's really a pain

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.120 
crapload of files and it's really a pain
in<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.030> ass<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.600> changed<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.290> color<00:01:53.500> blossom

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
in the ass I changed the color blossom

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.779 
in the ass I changed the color blossom
to<00:01:54.250> blue<00:01:54.429> by<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.640> way<00:01:55.890> normal<00:01:56.890> chests<00:01:57.490> or

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
winter blue so now they differentiate

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.359 
winter blue so now they differentiate
