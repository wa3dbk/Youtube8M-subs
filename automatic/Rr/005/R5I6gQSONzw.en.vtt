there now rolling these things up can be
a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:34.049> tricky<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> most

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
a little tricky you know the most

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
a little tricky you know the most
important<00:01:35.640> thing<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.090> making<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
important thing is making sure you do it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410 
important thing is making sure you do it
tightly<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.979> compactly<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:39.240> where

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
tightly and compactly and that's where

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
tightly and compactly and that's where
that<00:01:39.540> first<00:01:39.750> roll<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.470> important<00:01:40.950> because

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that first roll is so important because

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
that first roll is so important because
if<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.430> loosey-goosey<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.780> not

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
if it's loosey-goosey you know it's not

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
if it's loosey-goosey you know it's not
going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.259> work<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> good<00:01:44.189> first<00:01:44.820> tight

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
going to work so get a good first tight

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
going to work so get a good first tight
roll<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.409> ahead<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.799> bring<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> either

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
roll then go ahead and bring in either

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
roll then go ahead and bring in either
side<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.930> continue<00:01:49.110> rolling<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
side and then just continue rolling it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
side and then just continue rolling it
up<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.549> sometimes<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.210> gonna

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
up you know now sometimes it's gonna

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
up you know now sometimes it's gonna
want<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> tear<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.979> happens<00:01:53.399> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
want to tear but if that happens you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
want to tear but if that happens you
know<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.880> power<00:01:54.060> through<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.450> keep<00:01:54.630> rolling

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
know just power through and keep rolling

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.780 
know just power through and keep rolling
because<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.130> sticky<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because it's it's very sticky it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
because it's it's very sticky it's
almost<00:01:57.030> self-healing<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> gets<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
almost self-healing and when it gets to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
almost self-healing and when it gets to
the<00:01:58.619> edge<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:02:00.000> stick<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.630> when

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the edge it's gonna stick you know when

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.999 
the edge it's gonna stick you know when
you<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.290> rolled<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.860> almost

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you get it all rolled up it's almost

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.580 
you get it all rolled up it's almost
like<00:02:02.399> an<00:02:02.549> envelope<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.409> put
