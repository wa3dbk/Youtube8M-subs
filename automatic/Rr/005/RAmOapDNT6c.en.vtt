 grams of refined sugar 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.350
 we require extra refined sugar to 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 frost in the bowl of the blender 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.400
 we put the flour with the shovel 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.370
 we started mixing at first speed 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.300
 we incorporate salt yeast 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.690
 to sugar and we let these combine 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.690
 ingredients 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.560
 separately we shell the egg 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.510
 and we add it to our ingredients 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.620
 dried 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 in the same way we separate the yolk and 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.280
 we add to our preparation 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 we incorporated the water and we continue 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
 always beating at first speed 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.859
 we add cinnamon powder 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 and we continue beating until we have a 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.340
 sandy mass 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.060
 Here we appreciate how our 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.490
 prepared 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.430
 once our dough is gritty 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.950
 we incorporate the lard and 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.890
 we continue beating to integrate all 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.489
 These ingredients must 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.870
 Adhere to the shovel is not necessary 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.870
 work the dough too much 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.730
 we remove from the blender we place it in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.530
 a bowl and cover with plastic paper 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.530
 let stand for 10 minutes 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.480
 meanwhile we grease with lard 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.480
 pig a tray 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.300
 we combine cottage cheese and sugar 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.810
 we mix it and place it inside a 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.810
 pastry bag 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.269
 after 10 minutes of rest 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.569
 of our mass we proceed to position 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.569
 the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.750
 once positioned in flour we 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.160
 work table and we started to form 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.160
 some long tortillas 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.720
 should be a little thick with the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.560
 help of a plastic scraper we mark 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.630
 horizontal and vertical lines 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.580
 We flipped our tortilla and the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.100
 fill with cottage cheese 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.890
 we close wrapping as if it were a 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.350
 taco the tips should look good 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.060
 closed to prevent the filling from 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.000
 escape 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.520
 we repeat the same operation with each 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.060
 one of the pieces 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:49.060
 also remember that it is necessary to turn 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.810
 our tortilla to fill it 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.640
 once finished forming the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.090
 we place on our tray 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.680
 oiled and we take immediately to 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.550
 220 degree centigrade oven from 8 to 10 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.610
 minutes 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.030
 once baked we remove them and 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.880
 frost moss in the sugar we place 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.620
 in one way our product is 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.580
 ready to serve it I hope this
