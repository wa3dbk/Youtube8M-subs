00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and when after doing a couple runs just

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
and when after doing a couple runs just
like<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.750> first<00:00:18.930> day<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> got<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.710> have

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
like the first day that I got to have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.730 
like the first day that I got to have
been<00:00:20.010> smelling<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.760> electronic<00:00:21.420> smell

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
been smelling this like electronic smell

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.960 
been smelling this like electronic smell
inside<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> thought<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.519> maybe<00:00:23.699> like

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
inside and I thought it was maybe like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.150 
inside and I thought it was maybe like
the<00:00:24.180> twenty<00:00:24.869> two<00:00:24.990> motor<00:00:25.410> brushless<00:00:25.769> motor

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the twenty two motor brushless motor

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000 
the twenty two motor brushless motor
breaking<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.150> something<00:00:27.960> something<00:00:28.800> weird

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
breaking in or something something weird

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.720 
breaking in or something something weird
like<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.359> but<00:00:30.359> uh<00:00:30.769> come<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.920> find<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
like that but uh come to find out it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.750 
like that but uh come to find out it
actually<00:00:33.059> has<00:00:33.660> been<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:35.059> slipper<00:00:36.059> clutch<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
actually has been my slipper clutch and
this<00:00:39.360> thing<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> totally<00:00:40.230> fried<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this thing just just totally fried this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.549 
this thing just just totally fried this
thing<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.370> gone<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
thing is just gone that this is

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
thing is just gone that this is
literally<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.190> remains<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
literally that all that remains from it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
literally that all that remains from it
but<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.329> cooling<00:00:48.750> fins<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:50.480> help<00:00:51.800> push

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but the the cooling fins that help push

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970 
but the the cooling fins that help push
up<00:00:53.039> against<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> pad<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.110> opposite<00:00:55.739> side

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
up against the pad on the opposite side

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
up against the pad on the opposite side
of<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.430> pads<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.969> pushed<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.329> against

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
of where the pads get pushed up against

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.030 
of where the pads get pushed up against
just<00:00:58.530> completely<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.210> rubbed<00:01:00.210> onto<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:02.609> disc

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
just completely got rubbed onto the disc

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.330 
just completely got rubbed onto the disc
and<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.420> caused<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.659> malfunction<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and that caused a malfunction in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
and that caused a malfunction in the
disc<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> pressure<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:11.840> caused<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
disc and the pressure and it caused the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.910 
disc and the pressure and it caused the
pads<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.470> erode<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.869> basically<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.530> car<00:01:16.740> was

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pads to erode and basically my car was

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
pads to erode and basically my car was
just<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.340> standing<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.729> not

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
just like just standing there just not

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
just like just standing there just not
doing<00:01:18.750> anything<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.380> accelerate<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
doing anything but I would accelerate it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
doing anything but I would accelerate it
and<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.229> hear

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and it just it's just do you just hear

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
and it just it's just do you just hear
it<00:01:22.439> spin<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.520> made<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.700> happy<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it spin so that made me happy that it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.880 
it spin so that made me happy that it
wasn't<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:26.240> 2200<00:01:27.240> kV<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.560> actually

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
wasn't actually my 2200 kV but actually

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840 
wasn't actually my 2200 kV but actually
my<00:01:29.390> slipper<00:01:30.390> clutch<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.040> gonna<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.520> put

in the racing diff the came with or the
son<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> differential<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:40.229> came<00:01:40.439> with

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
son of differential that came with

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.980 
son of differential that came with
Traxxas<00:01:42.030> ultimate<00:01:42.600> maybe<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.710> plastic

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
Traxxas ultimate maybe this plastic

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.899 
Traxxas ultimate maybe this plastic
center<00:01:45.990> differential<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:47.100> hold<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
center differential will hold up a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.069 
center differential will hold up a
little<00:01:48.090> bit<00:01:48.210> better<00:01:49.009> put<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> 22<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079
