little<00:00:56.699> demo<00:00:57.140> now<00:00:58.140> I'll<00:00:58.350> first<00:00:58.590> demonstrate

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
little demo now I'll first demonstrate

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
little demo now I'll first demonstrate
this<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> pedal<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.230> see

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this with the pedal off and you can see

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.490 
this with the pedal off and you can see
it<00:01:01.500> adds<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> noise<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:03.390> your

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
it adds a little bit of noise to your

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
it adds a little bit of noise to your
system<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> might<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> rocktron

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
system so I think I might get a rocktron

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.450 
system so I think I might get a rocktron
hush<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:07.260> soon<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.890> silence<00:01:08.220> some<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
hush pretty soon just to silence some of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
hush pretty soon just to silence some of
that<00:01:08.520> noise<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.119> anyway<00:01:09.360> let's<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that noise but anyway let's have a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
that noise but anyway let's have a
listen<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.500> we'll<00:01:11.369> play<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> couple<00:01:11.790> riffs<00:01:12.150> or

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
listen and we'll play a couple riffs or

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
listen and we'll play a couple riffs or
licks<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.020> we'll<00:01:13.229> kick<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.040> we'll

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
licks and then we'll kick it on we'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
licks and then we'll kick it on we'll
see<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> difference<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.630> we'll

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
see the difference and then what we'll

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
see the difference and then what we'll
do<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> we'll<00:01:16.200> try<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> clean<00:01:17.159> setting<00:01:17.460> as

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
do is we'll try it in a clean setting as

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
do is we'll try it in a clean setting as
well<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.240> I'll<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.960> play<00:01:19.170> whatever<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.890> guess

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
well so I'll just play whatever I guess

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.609 
well so I'll just play whatever I guess
doesn't<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.580> matter

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
doesn't really matter

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
doesn't really matter
I'll<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.799> kick<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.130> off<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.939> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I'll just kick this off and here we go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:41.170 
I'll just kick this off and here we go

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.950 

all<00:01:51.790> right<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.150> was<00:01:52.240> some<00:01:52.360> classic<00:01:52.780> Alice

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
all right so that was some classic Alice

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.240 
all right so that was some classic Alice
in<00:01:53.170> Chains<00:01:53.200> now<00:01:53.620> what<00:01:53.770> we'll<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.040> we'll

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
in Chains now what we'll do is we'll

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.910 
in Chains now what we'll do is we'll
kick<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.610> on<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.810> I've<00:01:56.080> got<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.380> sonic<00:01:56.710> stop

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
kick it on now I've got the sonic stop

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:22.880 
kick it on now I've got the sonic stop
engaged

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.870 

so<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.340> hear<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.550> difference

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
so I think you can hear the difference

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.550 
so I think you can hear the difference
there<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.150> sounded<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> lot<00:02:25.750> tighter

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
there it sounded a lot tighter

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.440 
there it sounded a lot tighter
it<00:02:26.830> sounded<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.910> notes<00:02:28.090> were<00:02:28.240> kind

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
it sounded like all the notes were kind

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.930 
it sounded like all the notes were kind
of<00:02:28.540> lining<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.260> me<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.560> sounded<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.190> lot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
of lining up to me it sounded a lot

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
of lining up to me it sounded a lot
better<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.690> mean<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.380> hundred<00:02:32.620> bucks<00:02:32.650> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
better I mean for a hundred bucks I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.680 
better I mean for a hundred bucks I
think<00:02:33.010> that's<00:02:33.250> what<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.490> goes<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:34.420> makes<00:02:34.600> a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
think that's what it goes for it makes a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.480 
think that's what it goes for it makes a
huge<00:02:34.900> difference<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.040> let's<00:02:36.190> hit

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
huge difference I think so let's hit

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.820 
huge difference I think so let's hit
let's<00:02:37.210> try<00:02:37.360> something<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.020> clean<00:02:38.470> sound<00:02:38.890> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
let's try something on a clean sound and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.950 
let's try something on a clean sound and
see<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.550> chorus<00:02:43.540> pedal<00:02:43.870> do

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
see if I can get my chorus pedal do

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.720 
see if I can get my chorus pedal do
engage<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.590> won't<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:45.190> we'll<00:02:45.520> hear<00:02:45.670> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
engage and it won't that we'll hear it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.800 
engage and it won't that we'll hear it
without<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.030> chorus<00:02:46.300> pedal<00:02:46.420> then

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
without the chorus pedal then

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.540 
without the chorus pedal then
so<00:02:47.080> I'll<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.320> play<00:02:47.500> something<00:02:47.740> clean<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
so I'll just play something clean and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.490 
so I'll just play something clean and
then<00:02:49.150> we'll<00:02:49.300> compare<00:02:49.450> how<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.840> sounds<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
then we'll compare how it sounds with it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.920 
then we'll compare how it sounds with it
in<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.070> out<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.030> go<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
in and out so here we go with just the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.990 
in and out so here we go with just the
no<00:02:53.530> sonic<00:02:54.070> stomp<00:02:54.280> at<00:02:54.460> all

and<00:03:08.380> that's<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> clean<00:03:08.800> setting<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
and that's the clean setting on the

enough<00:03:11.230> pretty<00:03:11.410> clean<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.830> then<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:12.520> we<00:03:12.610> got

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
enough pretty clean and then here we got

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.050 
enough pretty clean and then here we got
the<00:03:12.880> song<00:03:13.060> stomp<00:03:13.420> on

so<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:28.040> me<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.370> notes<00:03:28.610> really<00:03:28.970> seemed<00:03:29.930> to

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
so for me the notes really seemed to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.850 
so for me the notes really seemed to
ring<00:03:30.319> out<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:31.310> seems<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.730> lot<00:03:31.940> brighter<00:03:32.860> more

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
ring out it seems a lot brighter more

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.190 
ring out it seems a lot brighter more
jangly<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.760> know<00:03:34.849> I<00:03:34.970> think<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> way<00:03:36.080> it

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
jangly I know I think I like the way it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.589 
jangly I know I think I like the way it
sounds<00:03:36.410> let's<00:03:36.739> try<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.340> lead<00:03:38.000> I'm<00:03:38.239> gonna<00:03:38.360> kick

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
sounds let's try a lead I'm gonna kick

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.960 
sounds let's try a lead I'm gonna kick
in<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.170> mark<00:03:39.500> tremonti<00:03:39.620> Morley<00:03:40.310> wah<00:03:40.550> here

in the mark tremonti Morley wah here

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.180 
in the mark tremonti Morley wah here
maybe<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.690> little<00:03:41.959> phase<00:03:42.140> 90<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.950> I'm<00:03:43.010> just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
maybe a little phase 90 and I'm just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.130 
maybe a little phase 90 and I'm just
gonna<00:03:43.340> kind<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.700> make<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.420> bit<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.690> noise<00:03:44.780> but

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
gonna kind of make a bit of noise but

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.380 
gonna kind of make a bit of noise but
anyway<00:03:45.590> let's<00:03:45.770> us<00:03:45.890> we'll<00:03:46.430> do<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.700> without<00:03:46.880> it

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
anyway let's us we'll do it without it

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.120 
anyway let's us we'll do it without it
so<00:03:48.080> it's<00:03:48.230> off<00:03:48.440> right<00:03:48.770> now

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
so it's off right now

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.040 
so it's off right now
I'm<00:03:49.220> gonna<00:03:49.370> kick<00:03:49.580> on<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.760> phase<00:03:50.030> 90<00:03:50.300> I'm<00:03:50.900> gonna

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
I'm gonna kick on the phase 90 I'm gonna

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.750 
I'm gonna kick on the phase 90 I'm gonna
use<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> little<00:03:51.440> more<00:03:51.650> come<00:03:51.830> on<00:03:51.920> dy<00:03:52.130> here<00:03:52.580> and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
use a little more come on dy here and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.490 
use a little more come on dy here and
then<00:03:53.480> what<00:03:53.569> we'll<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.930> we'll<00:03:54.080> put<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.380> on

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
then what we'll do is we'll put it on

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:05.770 
then what we'll do is we'll put it on
we'll<00:03:54.650> see<00:03:54.769> how<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:54.980> sounds<00:04:04.450> all<00:04:05.450> right<00:04:05.569> so

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
we'll see how it sounds all right so

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.259 
we'll see how it sounds all right so
that's<00:04:05.900> with<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.350> off<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:07.519> sounds<00:04:07.880> all<00:04:08.000> right

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
that's with it off it sounds all right

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:28.230 
that's with it off it sounds all right
but<00:04:08.660> listen<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.049> difference<00:04:09.350> with<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.680> on

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.720 

so<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.690> can<00:04:29.870> hear<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.350> think<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.710> sounds<00:04:30.950> it

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
so you can hear it I think it sounds it

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.250 
so you can hear it I think it sounds it
sort<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.000> takes<00:04:32.270> whatever<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.810> have<00:04:33.050> and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
sort of takes whatever you have and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.920 
sort of takes whatever you have and
really<00:04:33.530> enhances<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.640> boosts<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.870> I

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
really enhances it and boosts it and I

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.120 
really enhances it and boosts it and I
think<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.290> great<00:04:36.500> sounding<00:04:36.800> pedal<00:04:37.070> so

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
think it's a great sounding pedal so

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.920 
think it's a great sounding pedal so
let's<00:04:37.250> have<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.430> closer<00:04:37.670> look<00:04:37.790> at<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.270> all<00:04:38.750> right

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
let's have a closer look at it all right

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.440 
let's have a closer look at it all right
here's<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.170> closer<00:04:39.470> look<00:04:39.860> at<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.430> BBE<00:04:40.730> sonic

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
here's a closer look at the BBE sonic

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.360 
here's a closer look at the BBE sonic
stomp<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.320> really<00:04:42.650> it's<00:04:42.800> pretty<00:04:43.010> simple

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
stomp and really it's pretty simple

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.830 
stomp and really it's pretty simple
pedal<00:04:43.670> you've<00:04:43.850> got<00:04:44.030> two<00:04:44.270> controls<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.810> have

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
pedal you've got two controls you have

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320 
pedal you've got two controls you have
the<00:04:45.110> low<00:04:45.350> contour<00:04:45.920> here<00:04:46.280> on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.760> left<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
the low contour here on the left and

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.110 
the low contour here on the left and
then<00:04:47.900> you've<00:04:48.020> got<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.560> process<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.940> right

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
then you've got the process on the right

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360 
then you've got the process on the right
now<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.360> have<00:04:50.570> these<00:04:50.720> both<00:04:50.960> set<00:04:51.320> at<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.130> 12

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
now I have these both set at the 12

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.280 
now I have these both set at the 12
o'clock<00:04:52.550> position<00:04:52.610> or<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.420> says<00:04:53.600> 5<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
o'clock position or it says 5 on the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.140 
o'clock position or it says 5 on the
dial<00:04:54.470> on<00:04:54.680> these<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.460> basically<00:04:55.730> those<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.030> do

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
dial on these and basically those you do

this<00:05:05.540> in<00:05:05.750> my<00:05:06.140> effects<00:05:06.650> loop<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:06.980> my<00:05:07.160> meso<00:05:07.790> mini

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
this in my effects loop in my meso mini

this in my effects loop in my meso mini
rectifier<00:05:08.570> 25<00:05:09.050> watt<00:05:09.380> but<00:05:10.010> you<00:05:10.160> could<00:05:10.310> use<00:05:10.460> this

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
rectifier 25 watt but you could use this

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.340 
rectifier 25 watt but you could use this
in<00:05:10.730> front<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.300> as<00:05:11.419> well<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.810> just<00:05:12.080> found<00:05:12.200> that

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
in front of it as well I just found that

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.710 
in front of it as well I just found that
it<00:05:12.530> sounded<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.919> little<00:05:12.950> bit<00:05:13.310> better<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:14.390> my

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
it sounded a little bit better in my

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.659 
it sounded a little bit better in my
effects<00:05:15.140> loop<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.470> kind<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.740> took<00:05:16.280> everything

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
effects loop it kind of took everything

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.460 
effects loop it kind of took everything
and<00:05:17.060> then<00:05:17.210> kind<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.480> tightened<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:17.900> up<00:05:18.020> just

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
and then kind of tightened it up just

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.590 
and then kind of tightened it up just
before<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.890> hits<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.220> output<00:05:19.640> tubes<00:05:19.880> so

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
before it hits the output tubes so

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.780 
before it hits the output tubes so
anyway<00:05:20.810> that's<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.110> little<00:05:21.500> demo<00:05:21.740> for<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.400> BB

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.850 
anyway that's the little demo for the BB
sonic<00:05:23.330> stomp<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:24.440> think<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:24.680> can<00:05:24.770> get
