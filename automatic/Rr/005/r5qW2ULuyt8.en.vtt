00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.360 

I'm<00:00:07.660> thinking<00:00:08.110> about<00:00:08.200> a<00:00:08.320> child<00:00:08.710> who<00:00:09.070> knows

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
I'm thinking about a child who knows

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.550 
I'm thinking about a child who knows
lots<00:00:09.640> of<00:00:09.850> words<00:00:10.090> but<00:00:10.510> doesn't<00:00:11.020> always<00:00:11.260> think

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.560 
lots of words but doesn't always think

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.810 
lots of words but doesn't always think
about<00:00:11.650> when<00:00:11.890> it<00:00:12.040> makes<00:00:12.220> sense

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
about when it makes sense

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.780 
about when it makes sense
so<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.230> obviously<00:00:14.380> a<00:00:14.740> child<00:00:15.070> that's<00:00:15.250> got

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
so this is obviously a child that's got

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.400 
so this is obviously a child that's got
a<00:00:15.820> lot<00:00:16.029> of<00:00:16.059> item<00:00:16.510> knowledge<00:00:16.900> but<00:00:17.080> we<00:00:17.230> know<00:00:17.380> that

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
a lot of item knowledge but we know that

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.620 
a lot of item knowledge but we know that
item<00:00:17.860> knowledge<00:00:18.190> in<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.970> of<00:00:19.090> itself<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.600> not

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
item knowledge in and of itself is not

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.360 
item knowledge in and of itself is not
sufficient<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.470> build<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.920> reading<00:00:21.220> and

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
sufficient to build a reading and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.880 
sufficient to build a reading and
writing<00:00:21.490> process<00:00:22.150> so<00:00:22.810> maybe<00:00:23.500> we<00:00:23.680> need<00:00:23.860> to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
writing process so maybe we need to

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.220 
writing process so maybe we need to
think<00:00:24.190> a<00:00:24.280> little<00:00:24.310> bit<00:00:24.490> more<00:00:24.820> about<00:00:25.230> strategic

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
think a little bit more about strategic

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.620 
think a little bit more about strategic
activity<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:27.670> know<00:00:27.760> but<00:00:27.910> and<00:00:28.240> these<00:00:28.390> are

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
activity you know but and these are

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.420 
activity you know but and these are
these<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:29.199> mental<00:00:29.560> activities<00:00:30.130> that<00:00:30.310> are

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
these the mental activities that are

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.329 
these the mental activities that are
initiated<00:00:31.029> by<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.210> child<00:00:31.690> and<00:00:32.199> they<00:00:33.129> take

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:33.339 
initiated by the child and they take

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.160 
initiated by the child and they take
place<00:00:33.550> in<00:00:33.609> his<00:00:33.879> head<00:00:34.149> so<00:00:34.659> it<00:00:34.749> makes<00:00:34.960> it<00:00:35.109> a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
place in his head so it makes it a

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.660 
place in his head so it makes it a
little<00:00:35.289> difficult<00:00:35.620> for<00:00:36.100> us<00:00:36.219> as<00:00:36.429> teachers

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
little difficult for us as teachers

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.729 
little difficult for us as teachers
because<00:00:37.210> we<00:00:37.239> can't<00:00:37.629> see<00:00:37.899> what's<00:00:38.109> going<00:00:38.409> on<00:00:38.530> up

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
because we can't see what's going on up

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.029 
because we can't see what's going on up
there<00:00:38.890> can<00:00:39.219> we<00:00:39.719> rather<00:00:40.719> than<00:00:41.199> defining

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
there can we rather than defining

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.509 
there can we rather than defining
strategies<00:00:42.670> as<00:00:42.940> what<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.749> teacher<00:00:44.079> does

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
strategies as what the teacher does

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.759 
strategies as what the teacher does
these<00:00:45.519> teachers<00:00:46.059> understand<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:47.109> strategic

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
these teachers understand that strategic

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.520 
these teachers understand that strategic
activities<00:00:48.399> represent<00:00:49.179> the<00:00:49.329> fast<00:00:49.719> brain<00:00:50.260> work

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
activities represent the fast brain work

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.590 
activities represent the fast brain work
that<00:00:50.979> the<00:00:51.129> learner<00:00:51.460> calls<00:00:51.940> up<00:00:52.179> to<00:00:52.210> solve

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
that the learner calls up to solve

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.950 
that the learner calls up to solve
problems<00:00:53.170> when<00:00:53.530> reading<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.010> writing<00:00:54.370> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
problems when reading and writing and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.719 
problems when reading and writing and
teachers<00:00:55.960> look<00:00:56.229> for<00:00:56.379> evidence<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.249> child's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
teachers look for evidence of a child's

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.779 
teachers look for evidence of a child's
strategic<00:00:58.389> activities<00:00:58.959> as<00:00:59.170> they<00:00:59.859> observe<00:01:00.249> how

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
strategic activities as they observe how

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.809 
strategic activities as they observe how
the<00:01:01.299> child<00:01:01.600> works<00:01:01.870> on<00:01:02.109> text<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:03.339> let's<00:01:03.579> think

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
the child works on text so let's think

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.940 
the child works on text so let's think
for<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.089> moment<00:01:04.149> about<00:01:04.449> what<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.079> we<00:01:05.199> can<00:01:05.560> see

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
for a moment about what is it we can see

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.399 
for a moment about what is it we can see
you<00:01:06.729> know<00:01:06.759> what<00:01:07.090> what<00:01:07.450> let's<00:01:07.600> talk<00:01:07.840> about<00:01:08.049> some

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
you know what what let's talk about some

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.130 
you know what what let's talk about some
behaviors<00:01:09.039> that<00:01:09.369> you're<00:01:09.549> noticing<00:01:09.969> when<00:01:10.899> he's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
behaviors that you're noticing when he's

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.230 
behaviors that you're noticing when he's
reading<00:01:11.409> well<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.369> been<00:01:12.520> observing<00:01:12.729> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
reading well I have been observing and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.880 
reading well I have been observing and
analyzing<00:01:13.329> some<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.110> his<00:01:14.259> behavior<00:01:14.439> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
analyzing some of his behavior and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.620 
analyzing some of his behavior and
that's<00:01:15.070> important<00:01:15.729> yes<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.329> one<00:01:16.450> of<00:01:16.539> the

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
that's important yes and one of the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.450 
that's important yes and one of the
things<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:16.990> I've<00:01:17.079> noticed<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.740> he

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
things that I've noticed is that he

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.580 
things that I've noticed is that he
doesn't<00:01:18.670> always<00:01:18.909> notice<00:01:19.810> or<00:01:19.960> stop<00:01:20.229> when<00:01:20.439> it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
doesn't always notice or stop when it's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.029 
doesn't always notice or stop when it's
wrong<00:01:20.859> oh<00:01:21.250> so<00:01:21.729> he's<00:01:21.909> not<00:01:22.060> monitoring<00:01:23.039> let's

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
wrong oh so he's not monitoring let's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.249 
wrong oh so he's not monitoring let's
think<00:01:24.430> about<00:01:24.700> strategic<00:01:25.600> activities

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
think about strategic activities

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.249 
think about strategic activities
initiated<00:01:27.189> by<00:01:27.340> children<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.090> some<00:01:28.750> actions

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
initiated by children and some actions

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.529 
initiated by children and some actions
teachers<00:01:29.799> can<00:01:30.039> take<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.640> encourage<00:01:31.270> those

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
teachers can take to encourage those

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.069 
teachers can take to encourage those
behaviors<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.009> food<00:01:33.750> smelled<00:01:34.799> good<00:01:36.929> try<00:01:37.929> that

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
behaviors the food smelled good try that

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:45.209 
behaviors the food smelled good try that
again<00:01:43.469> check<00:01:44.469> it<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.710> make<00:01:44.770> sure<00:01:44.890> you're

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
again check it and make sure you're

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.929 
again check it and make sure you're
right<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.450> child<00:01:46.869> monitored<00:01:47.740> he<00:01:48.579> showed

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
right this child monitored he showed

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.719 
right this child monitored he showed
that<00:01:48.969> he<00:01:49.210> knew<00:01:49.659> something<00:01:50.020> was<00:01:50.469> wrong<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.950> his

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
that he knew something was wrong and his

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.690 
that he knew something was wrong and his
teacher<00:01:51.999> knowing<00:01:52.780> he<00:01:52.960> could<00:01:53.109> fix<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.700> prompted

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
teacher knowing he could fix it prompted

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.809 
teacher knowing he could fix it prompted
him<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.939> try<00:01:55.359> it<00:01:55.420> again<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.020> check<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.819> helping

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
him to try it again and check it helping

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.289 
him to try it again and check it helping
him<00:01:58.060> learn<00:01:58.329> to<00:01:58.869> check<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.289> himself<00:02:00.299> children

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
him learn to check on himself children

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.969 
him learn to check on himself children
must<00:02:01.630> learn<00:02:01.749> to<00:02:02.200> search<00:02:02.499> for<00:02:02.770> information

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
must learn to search for information

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.359 
must learn to search for information
when<00:02:03.670> reading<00:02:03.939> what<00:02:04.899> would<00:02:05.109> make<00:02:05.289> sense<00:02:05.530> does

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
when reading what would make sense does

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.850 
when reading what would make sense does
it<00:02:06.490> look<00:02:06.640> right<00:02:06.850> can<00:02:07.569> we<00:02:07.780> say<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.410> way

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
it look right can we say it that way

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.850 
it look right can we say it that way
Thich<00:02:09.430> was<00:02:09.790> little

let's<00:05:16.540> take<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.750> look<00:05:16.930> at<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.140> cover<00:05:17.410> what<00:05:17.860> kind

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
let's take a look at the cover what kind

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.430 
let's take a look at the cover what kind
of<00:05:18.130> message<00:05:18.520> do<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.730> think<00:05:18.790> that<00:05:19.210> dog<00:05:19.960> on<00:05:20.290> the

of message do you think that dog on the
cutter<00:05:20.650> is<00:05:20.950> sending<00:05:21.520> do<00:05:22.240> you<00:05:22.360> know<00:05:22.510> what<00:05:22.690> they

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
cutter is sending do you know what they

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.870 
cutter is sending do you know what they
call<00:05:23.080> frogs<00:05:23.470> what<00:05:23.740> animal<00:05:24.190> kingdom<00:05:24.580> they<00:05:24.730> are

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
call frogs what animal kingdom they are

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.600 
call frogs what animal kingdom they are
they're<00:05:25.240> not<00:05:25.390> Birds<00:05:25.630> are<00:05:26.020> they<00:05:26.230> are<00:05:27.100> they

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
they're not Birds are they are they

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.430 
they're not Birds are they are they
insects<00:05:28.120> yeah

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
insects yeah

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.030 
insects yeah
now<00:05:30.430> they<00:05:30.700> frogs<00:05:31.240> are<00:05:31.600> amphibians<00:05:31.919> can<00:05:32.919> you

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
now they frogs are amphibians can you

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.260 
now they frogs are amphibians can you
say<00:05:33.220> amphibian<00:05:35.490> amphibian<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.669> that<00:05:36.910> means

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
say amphibian amphibian and that means

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.100 
say amphibian amphibian and that means
so<00:05:38.080> reading<00:05:38.919> familiar<00:05:39.640> books<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.180> new<00:05:40.870> books

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
so reading familiar books and new books

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.980 
so reading familiar books and new books
with<00:05:41.500> support<00:05:41.950> provide<00:05:42.820> many<00:05:43.210> opportunities

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
with support provide many opportunities

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.530 
with support provide many opportunities
for<00:05:44.020> children<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.800> build<00:05:44.979> strategic

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
for children to build strategic

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.409 
for children to build strategic
processing<00:05:46.540> systems<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.590> is<00:05:48.280> also<00:05:48.880> important

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
processing systems it is also important

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.510 
processing systems it is also important
to<00:05:49.630> check<00:05:49.960> for<00:05:50.169> evidence<00:05:50.350> of<00:05:50.830> strategic

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
to check for evidence of strategic

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.840 
to check for evidence of strategic
activities<00:05:52.180> with<00:05:52.570> individual<00:05:53.290> children<00:05:53.850> with

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
activities with individual children with

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.600 
activities with individual children with
running<00:05:55.330> records<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.990> text<00:05:56.410> reading<00:05:56.710> teachers

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
running records of text reading teachers

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.360 
running records of text reading teachers
can<00:05:57.850> record<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.510> analyze<00:05:59.229> behaviors<00:06:00.100> and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
can record and analyze behaviors and

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.230 
can record and analyze behaviors and
monitor<00:06:01.300> progress<00:06:01.330> over<00:06:02.169> time<00:06:02.370> it's<00:06:03.370> not<00:06:03.729> just

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
monitor progress over time it's not just

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.050 
monitor progress over time it's not just
about<00:06:04.390> accurate<00:06:05.200> reading<00:06:05.620> it's<00:06:06.430> more<00:06:06.820> about

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
about accurate reading it's more about

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.300 
about accurate reading it's more about
how<00:06:07.300> children<00:06:07.630> are<00:06:07.900> learning<00:06:08.260> how<00:06:08.919> to<00:06:08.950> solve

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
how children are learning how to solve

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.260 
how children are learning how to solve
problems<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:11.250> effective<00:06:12.250> teachers<00:06:12.700> provide

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
problems so effective teachers provide

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.510 
problems so effective teachers provide
massive<00:06:13.770> opportunities<00:06:14.770> for<00:06:15.070> children<00:06:15.310> to

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
massive opportunities for children to

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240 
massive opportunities for children to
successfully<00:06:16.419> read<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:16.930> write<00:06:17.290> texts<00:06:17.860> within

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
successfully read and write texts within

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.760 
successfully read and write texts within
their<00:06:18.550> reach<00:06:18.760> so<00:06:19.060> they<00:06:19.780> will<00:06:19.960> build<00:06:20.200> up<00:06:20.410> the

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
their reach so they will build up the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.710 
their reach so they will build up the
networks<00:06:21.220> in<00:06:21.460> their<00:06:21.700> brain<00:06:21.970> to<00:06:22.390> pick<00:06:22.570> up

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
networks in their brain to pick up

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.860

meaningful ways to support children as

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.900 
meaningful ways to support children as
they<00:06:35.800> continue<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.370> build

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
they continue to build

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.750 
they continue to build
