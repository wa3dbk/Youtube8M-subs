drift<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:57.110> think<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:58.130> demonstrates<00:01:58.429> a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
drift I think that it demonstrates a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.899 
drift I think that it demonstrates a
high<00:01:59.090> level<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.600> skill<00:01:59.959> of<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.890> sport<00:02:01.369> because

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
high level of skill of the sport because

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.270 
high level of skill of the sport because
every<00:02:02.270> driver<00:02:02.569> has<00:02:02.869> its<00:02:03.530> own<00:02:03.709> style<00:02:04.069> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
every driver has its own style and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.240 
every driver has its own style and
whether<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:05.690> done<00:02:06.289> with<00:02:06.530> one<00:02:06.830> or<00:02:07.039> multiple

whether it is done with one or multiple

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.509 
whether it is done with one or multiple
cars<00:02:07.819> I<00:02:08.119> think<00:02:08.509> that's<00:02:08.690> drifting<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.649> seen<00:02:10.250> as

cars I think that's drifting is seen as

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.210 
cars I think that's drifting is seen as
much<00:02:10.729> more<00:02:10.970> than<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> sport<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.950> think<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.100> a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
much more than a sport I think it's a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:46.910 
much more than a sport I think it's a
