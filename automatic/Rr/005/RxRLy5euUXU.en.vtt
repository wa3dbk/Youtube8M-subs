00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
then the pigment is released and it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
then the pigment is released and it's
able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.110> taken<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.860> absorbed<00:01:56.280> by<00:01:56.490> the

about<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.970> treatment<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.720> it's<00:02:00.840> very

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
about the treatment is that it's very

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.859 
about the treatment is that it's very
quick<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.130> each<00:02:02.369> treatment<00:02:02.790> only<00:02:03.330> takes<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.840> few

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
quick so each treatment only takes a few

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.830 
quick so each treatment only takes a few
minutes<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> even<00:02:05.700> though<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.970> intense<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
minutes so even though it's intense it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.230 
minutes so even though it's intense it's
much<00:02:07.170> quicker<00:02:07.530> than<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> original<00:02:09.000> tattoo
