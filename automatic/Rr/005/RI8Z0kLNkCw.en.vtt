it real easy up first and then you can
start<00:01:10.189> moving<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.610> now<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.790> gears<00:01:11.119> get<00:01:11.330> a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
start moving in now the gears get a

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.789 
start moving in now the gears get a
little<00:01:11.510> bit<00:01:11.600> more<00:01:11.780> torque<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.320> every<00:01:12.530> time<00:01:12.680> you
