00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
smart TV has all the functionality that

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.759 
smart TV has all the functionality that
you<00:00:10.099> think<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.190> would<00:00:11.280> need<00:00:12.080> but<00:00:13.080> apart<00:00:13.590> from

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
you think you would need but apart from

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.450 
you think you would need but apart from
the<00:00:13.920> function<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> record<00:00:14.929> now<00:00:16.010> step<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.220> was

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the function to record now step I was

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.920 
the function to record now step I was
going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.820> sky<00:00:18.119> originally<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:18.750> for

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
going to get sky originally but for

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
going to get sky originally but for
whatever<00:00:19.080> reasons<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.920> happened<00:00:20.310> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
whatever reasons that's not happened so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.310 
whatever reasons that's not happened so
I'm<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:20.910> been<00:00:21.060> able<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> pause<00:00:21.510> live<00:00:21.810> TV<00:00:21.840> or

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I'm not been able to pause live TV or

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.859 
I'm not been able to pause live TV or
record<00:00:22.680> anything<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:24.180> looking<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.720> buy

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
record anything so I was looking to buy

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.870 
record anything so I was looking to buy
online<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> hard<00:00:25.710> drive<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.820> able

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
online a hard drive that would be able

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060 
online a hard drive that would be able
to<00:00:27.119> plug<00:00:27.300> into<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> telly<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.140> record<00:00:28.769> things

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to plug into the telly and record things

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.880 
to plug into the telly and record things
from<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.580> respect

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
from that respect

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
from that respect
now<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.279> thought<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> confusion

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
now I thought there's a bit of confusion

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
now I thought there's a bit of confusion
really<00:00:34.020> having<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> lg<00:00:35.070> telly<00:00:35.340> whether<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really having a lg telly whether I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
really having a lg telly whether I
needed<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.899> LG<00:00:37.230> hard<00:00:37.500> drive<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.980> fit

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
needed some kind of LG hard drive to fit

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.959 
needed some kind of LG hard drive to fit
onto<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> telly

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
onto the telly

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.990 
onto the telly
but<00:00:39.510> that's<00:00:39.690> anyway<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.670> actual<00:00:41.940> fact

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
but that's anyway at work in actual fact

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.770 
but that's anyway at work in actual fact
that's<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> case

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that's not the case

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.529 
that's not the case
I<00:00:43.050> bought<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> samsung<00:00:44.100> 2<00:00:44.399> terabyte<00:00:44.910> hard<00:00:45.180> drive

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
I bought a samsung 2 terabyte hard drive

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
I bought a samsung 2 terabyte hard drive
the<00:00:46.050> links<00:00:46.320> below<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.710> video<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.879> allows

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the links below this video which allows

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
the links below this video which allows
the<00:00:49.170> tally<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> functionality<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the tally to do all the functionality of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
the tally to do all the functionality of
recording<00:00:51.870> Paulding<00:00:52.440> telly<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.180> instance

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
recording Paulding telly so for instance

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.900 
recording Paulding telly so for instance
let<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.809> show<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
let me just show you if I go to the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.439 
let me just show you if I go to the
remote<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> press<00:00:58.129> pause

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
remote and press pause

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.860 
remote and press pause
the<00:01:00.449> telus<00:01:00.960> pause<00:01:01.219> unpause<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the telus pause unpause it then if I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
the telus pause unpause it then if I
want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> record<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> same

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
want to record it I can do the same

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.770 
want to record it I can do the same
thing<00:01:07.909> separately<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.360> record<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
thing separately so you can record this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730 
thing separately so you can record this
program<00:01:11.960> which<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.049> doing<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
program which is doing now what you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.100 
program which is doing now what you
would<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> hard<00:01:14.430> drive

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
would go to the hard drive

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
would go to the hard drive
the<00:01:16.110> only<00:01:16.229> flaw<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> hard<00:01:17.280> drive

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the only flaw to this is the hard drive

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
the only flaw to this is the hard drive
that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> buy<00:01:17.909> has<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.570> formatted<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.380> soon

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that you buy has to be formatted as soon

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.679 
that you buy has to be formatted as soon
as<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> plug<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.000> plugs<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.360> telly

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
as you plug it in so it plugs into telly

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.429 
as you plug it in so it plugs into telly
by<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> USB<00:01:22.350> 3.0<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.810> means<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.290> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
by a USB 3.0 but it just means if it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
by a USB 3.0 but it just means if it's
portable<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.130> mine<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.090> won't<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> able

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
portable like mine is you won't be able

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.289 
portable like mine is you won't be able
to<00:01:27.600> use<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.110> systems<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.299> because

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to use it on other systems and because

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170 
to use it on other systems and because
it's<00:01:30.479> settle<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.100> purely<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it's settle to be purely for this this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's settle to be purely for this this
particular<00:01:33.360> type<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> telly<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> stuff

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
particular type of telly and stuff

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
particular type of telly and stuff
something<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> bear<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.030> mind<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.509> firm<00:01:37.020> from

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
something to bear in mind for firm from

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.609 
something to bear in mind for firm from
my<00:01:37.860> point<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> view<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.030> hard<00:01:39.479> drive<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.470> did

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
my point of view the hard drive it did

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
my point of view the hard drive it did
cost<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> money<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
cost a little bit of money but at the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.120 
cost a little bit of money but at the
end<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> day<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.259> record<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
end of the day I can now record things I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
end of the day I can now record things I
can<00:01:44.280> stop<00:01:44.520> telly<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.899> actually<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.409> record

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can stop telly and actually can record

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
can stop telly and actually can record
up<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> thousand<00:01:47.909> hours<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.390> for

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
up to about a thousand hours I think for

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.440 
up to about a thousand hours I think for
a<00:01:48.930> member<00:01:49.170> eilen<00:01:49.560> which<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> brilliant<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
a member eilen which is brilliant so and
