00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.450 
to pair the smart device in a SmartWatch
first<00:00:07.080> thing<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.379> had<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.529> make<00:00:07.740> sure<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.160> there

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
first thing we had to make sure is there

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.830 
first thing we had to make sure is there
for<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> setting<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> smart<00:00:10.679> phone<00:00:10.769> for<00:00:11.840> the

for the setting on a smart phone for the
Bluetooth<00:00:13.790> mixture<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> feasible<00:00:15.800> or<00:00:16.800> near

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
Bluetooth mixture is a feasible or near

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.560 
Bluetooth mixture is a feasible or near
the<00:00:17.400> Bluetooth<00:00:17.789> device<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.740> then<00:00:20.270> for<00:00:21.270> asthma

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the Bluetooth device and then for asthma

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.950 
the Bluetooth device and then for asthma
was<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:22.470> sure<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.340> blue<00:00:23.550> trace<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.119> like

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
was make sure is the blue trace on like

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.400 
was make sure is the blue trace on like
this<00:00:26.689> okay<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:29.480> before<00:00:30.480> preparing<00:00:31.050> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
this okay that is before preparing we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
this okay that is before preparing we

and here is a process for the pairing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.490 
and here is a process for the pairing
press<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.490 

right

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.520 

and<00:01:36.880> how<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:37.940> make<00:01:38.210> sure<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> both<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
and how we make sure is a both of the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.810 
and how we make sure is a both of the
device<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.540> synchronous<00:01:42.040> we<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:43.490> have<00:01:43.670> to

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
device is synchronous we just have to

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.000 
device is synchronous we just have to
press<00:01:44.030> send<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.480> notification<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.410> we<00:01:45.620> can<00:01:45.800> see

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
press send a notification and we can see

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.280 
press send a notification and we can see
is<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:47.080> fabric

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
is a fabric

is a fabric
can<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.860> feel<00:01:49.070> from<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> smog<00:01:49.910> was<00:01:50.060> less<00:01:50.540> mean

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
can you feel from the smog was less mean

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.210 
can you feel from the smog was less mean
before<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.740> device<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.310> telling<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.220> one

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
before the device is telling and one

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.800 
before the device is telling and one
more<00:01:55.460> thing<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.820> we<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.300> make<00:01:56.450> sure<00:01:56.480> is

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
more thing is we have to make sure is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.550 
more thing is we have to make sure is
the<00:01:57.020> forest<00:01:57.440> setting<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.960> go<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.290> the

activate notification surface and then

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.770 
activate notification surface and then
on<00:02:05.630> for<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.290> speed<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.040> Mewar<00:02:07.280> seems<00:02:07.780> like

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
on for the speed of Mewar seems like

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.330 
on for the speed of Mewar seems like
this<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:14.060> function<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:15.380> push<00:02:15.920> order
