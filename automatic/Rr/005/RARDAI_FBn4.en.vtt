00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
it's a fun way to light but it also
makes<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> sense<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:52.020> you're<00:01:52.350> able

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
makes a lot of sense because you're able

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
makes a lot of sense because you're able
to<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> million<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.369> angles<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to get a million different angles and it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.260 
to get a million different angles and it
was<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.020> fantastic<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> air<00:01:56.850> remote

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
was so fantastic to have the air remote

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.020 
was so fantastic to have the air remote
on<00:01:57.479> top<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.899> camera<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
on top of the camera because that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.359 
on top of the camera because that
was<00:01:59.240> really<00:01:59.510> up<00:01:59.750> high<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.500> just<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:01.100> do<00:02:01.220> it

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
was really up high and just to do it

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.219 
was really up high and just to do it
remotely<00:02:01.670> from<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.090> camera<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.659> was<00:02:02.780> really

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
remotely from the camera it was really

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.080 
remotely from the camera it was really
really<00:02:03.409> cool<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.159> great<00:02:04.520> when<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.850> have

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
really cool it is great when you have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.460 
really cool it is great when you have
the<00:02:05.330> ability<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.690> have<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.049> air<00:02:06.200> remote

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
the ability to have the air remote

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.990 
the ability to have the air remote
because<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.070> make<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.549> unreachable

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
because you can make the unreachable

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.150 
because you can make the unreachable
light<00:02:08.479> suddenly<00:02:08.810> at<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.470> fingertips<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
light suddenly at your fingertips and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.309 
light suddenly at your fingertips and
that<00:02:10.280> makes<00:02:10.459> all<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> difference<00:02:11.319> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
that makes all the difference the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.590 
that makes all the difference the
Profoto<00:02:12.709> reflector<00:02:13.610> that's<00:02:13.760> built<00:02:14.090> into<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
Profoto reflector that's built into the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.860 
Profoto reflector that's built into the
d1<00:02:14.930> air<00:02:15.080> literally<00:02:15.860> took<00:02:16.069> me<00:02:16.220> by<00:02:16.400> surprise

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
d1 air literally took me by surprise

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.270 
d1 air literally took me by surprise
when<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> first<00:02:18.200> started<00:02:18.470> using<00:02:18.680> them<00:02:18.980> because

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
when I first started using them because

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.710 
when I first started using them because
I<00:02:19.310> expected<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> unit<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.450> I'd<00:02:20.630> be

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
I expected to have a unit that I'd be

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.809 
I expected to have a unit that I'd be
adding<00:02:21.080> reflectors<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.160> then<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> realized

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
adding reflectors to and then I realized

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.850 
adding reflectors to and then I realized
that<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> Profoto<00:02:23.450> reflector<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.709> it

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
that the Profoto reflector that's in it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.250 
that the Profoto reflector that's in it
is<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.790> remarkable<00:02:26.360> reflector<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.930> edit<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
is a remarkable reflector and edit of a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.729 
is a remarkable reflector and edit of a
self<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:28.550> straight<00:02:29.030> enough<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.680> not

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
self it's straight enough that it's not

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.070 
self it's straight enough that it's not
flaring<00:02:31.250> off<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.850> just<00:02:32.000> lighting<00:02:32.360> everything

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
flaring off and just lighting everything

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.870 
flaring off and just lighting everything
but<00:02:33.769> it's<00:02:34.010> kind<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.519> medium

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
but it's kind of like that medium

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.400 
but it's kind of like that medium
reflector<00:02:35.300> that's<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.600> perfect<00:02:35.900> amount<00:02:36.170> of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
reflector that's the perfect amount of

reflector that's the perfect amount of
light<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> perfect<00:02:37.519> reflective<00:02:38.300> quality

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
light and the perfect reflective quality

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.360 
light and the perfect reflective quality
to<00:02:38.989> give<00:02:39.350> me<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> exact<00:02:39.830> result<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.280> I'm

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
to give me the exact result that I'm

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.949 
to give me the exact result that I'm
looking<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:44.090> had<00:02:44.239> another<00:02:44.480> one<00:02:44.720> light

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
looking for we had another one light

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.660 
looking for we had another one light
setup<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.680> were<00:02:45.860> going<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.069> create<00:02:46.220> we

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
setup that we were going to create we

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.640 
setup that we were going to create we
wanted<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.120> kind<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.450> blend<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.440> light

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
wanted to kind of blend that one light

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
wanted to kind of blend that one light
setup<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> natural<00:02:49.940> um<00:02:50.180> being<00:02:50.390> like

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
setup with the natural um being like

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.050 
setup with the natural um being like
that<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:50.959> filling<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.500> room<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.730> beauty

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that was filling the room and the beauty

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.820 
that was filling the room and the beauty
dish<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.780> great<00:02:54.080> light<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.650> that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
dish is really a great light to do that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.650 
dish is really a great light to do that
with<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.489> does<00:02:55.700> spread<00:02:56.120> light<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.600> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
with because it does spread light in a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.000 
with because it does spread light in a
lot<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.930> different<00:02:57.200> directions<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.800> it's<00:02:57.920> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
lot of different directions and it's a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.610 
lot of different directions and it's a
very<00:02:58.340> soft<00:02:58.730> quality<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.360> light<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.810> although

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
very soft quality of light and although

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.590 
very soft quality of light and although
it's<00:03:00.950> soft<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.459> still<00:03:01.670> has<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.819> very<00:03:02.060> fashion

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
it's soft it still has a very fashion

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.780 
it's soft it still has a very fashion
quality<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.530> because<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.579> very

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
quality to it because it is very

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.870 
quality to it because it is very
directional<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.600> same<00:03:05.780> time<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:07.579> beauty

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
directional at the same time the beauty

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.210 
directional at the same time the beauty
dishes<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.480> without<00:03:08.870> question<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.709> workhorse

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
dishes is without question a workhorse

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.670 
dishes is without question a workhorse
in<00:03:10.400> our<00:03:10.519> studio<00:03:10.910> because<00:03:11.329> it<00:03:11.840> allows<00:03:12.200> us<00:03:12.230> to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
in our studio because it allows us to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.380 
in our studio because it allows us to
quickly<00:03:12.920> put<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> grid<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.060> want<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
quickly put the grid on if we want to

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.569 
quickly put the grid on if we want to
have<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> very<00:03:14.810> fashionable<00:03:15.110> look<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.980> take<00:03:16.459> it

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
have a very fashionable look and take it

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.210 
have a very fashionable look and take it
off<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.000> wanted<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.360> spread<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> light

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
off if we wanted to spread the light

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.330 
off if we wanted to spread the light
it's<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:20.030> my<00:03:20.239> opinion<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.930> perfect<00:03:21.500> light<00:03:21.950> for

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's in my opinion the perfect light for

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.590 
it's in my opinion the perfect light for
doing<00:03:22.549> close-ups<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.720> portrait<00:03:24.230> work<00:03:25.600> so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
doing close-ups and and portrait work so

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.670 
doing close-ups and and portrait work so
that<00:03:26.750> gives<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.019> pretty<00:03:27.230> good<00:03:27.380> picture<00:03:27.530> of

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
that gives you a pretty good picture of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.650 
that gives you a pretty good picture of
how<00:03:27.859> we<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.160> different<00:03:28.579> one<00:03:28.700> light<00:03:28.910> setups<00:03:29.359> and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
how we do different one light setups and
