starting with the magic claw a quite
familiar<00:00:12.420> attack<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.500> also<00:00:13.650> have

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
familiar attack because you also have

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.870 
familiar attack because you also have
this<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.280> maplestory

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
this one in maplestory

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
this one in maplestory
and<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> hits<00:00:16.109> two<00:00:16.500> monsters

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and as you can see it hits two monsters

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.500 
and as you can see it hits two monsters
and<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> normal<00:00:18.000> map<00:00:18.090> story<00:00:18.359> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and just like the normal map story it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.990 
and just like the normal map story it
deals<00:00:18.750> damage<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.260> course<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.460> next<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
deals damage of course so next up is the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.480 
deals damage of course so next up is the
fire<00:00:21.330> tornado<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.470> deals<00:00:22.740> damage<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> goes

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
fire tornado it deals damage as it goes

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700 
fire tornado it deals damage as it goes
through<00:00:23.519> monsters<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.470> leave<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
through monsters and it will leave the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.790 
through monsters and it will leave the
models<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> burn<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> next<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.380> fiery

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
models with a burn so the next a fiery

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.269 
models with a burn so the next a fiery
team<00:00:29.160> skill<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.150> flame<00:00:30.660> bursts<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> flame

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
team skill is to flame bursts the flame

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.920 
team skill is to flame bursts the flame
versus<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> single<00:00:32.969> attack<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.480> hits<00:00:33.660> one

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
versus a single attack just hits one

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.060 
versus a single attack just hits one
monster<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.719> by<00:00:36.719> guessing<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:37.920> say

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
monster and by guessing I would say

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.170 
monster and by guessing I would say
it'll<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.430> leave<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> monsters<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it'll also leave the monsters with a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
it'll also leave the monsters with a
burn<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.989> next<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> -<00:00:40.559> always<00:00:40.800> awesome

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
burn so next up is - always awesome

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
burn so next up is - always awesome
Chain<00:00:41.940> Lightning<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.750> again<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> does

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
Chain Lightning and again what it does

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.660 
Chain Lightning and again what it does
is<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> skill<00:00:44.280> name

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is in the skill name

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.770 
is in the skill name
you<00:00:44.820> should<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> lightning<00:00:45.210> border<00:00:45.510> someone

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you should have lightning border someone

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
you should have lightning border someone
and<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> changed<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> multiple<00:00:46.920> enemies

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and it changed to multiple enemies

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
and it changed to multiple enemies
dealing<00:00:47.879> less<00:00:48.239> damage<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.079> enemies

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
dealing less damage to the more enemies

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
dealing less damage to the more enemies
hits<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.370> again<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.910> kill<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.329> super

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
hits but then again this kill is super

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
hits but then again this kill is super
duper<00:00:51.690> awesome<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> next<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> tumblr

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
duper awesome so next up is a tumblr

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.930 
duper awesome so next up is a tumblr
whip<00:00:54.770> that's<00:00:55.770> right<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.340> hit<00:00:56.489> multiple

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
whip that's right you hit multiple

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
whip that's right you hit multiple
monsters<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:58.079> paralyzes<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:59.039> or

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
monsters and it also paralyzes down or

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
monsters and it also paralyzes down or
something<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.879> quite<00:01:00.059> sure<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> does

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
something not quite sure what it does

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.209 
something not quite sure what it does
but<00:01:01.170> since<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> element<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.829> tunner<00:01:02.039> I'm

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
but since the element is tunner I'm

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
but since the element is tunner I'm
guessing<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> does<00:01:02.789> paralyzed<00:01:03.270> something

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
guessing it does paralyzed something

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
guessing it does paralyzed something
your<00:01:04.710> strange<00:01:04.979> thing<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.280> again<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.790> hits

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
your strange thing is that again it hits

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
your strange thing is that again it hits
two<00:01:06.270> monsters<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:06.990> three<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.580> not

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
two monsters and not three so I'm not

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
two monsters and not three so I'm not
sure<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> hit<00:01:09.330> everything<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sure if they can hit everything with the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.450 
sure if they can hit everything with the
turn<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.409> web<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.799> hey<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> least<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.340> have

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
turn or web but hey at least they have

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
turn or web but hey at least they have
some<00:01:11.640> range<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.630> next<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> frost<00:01:13.590> Nova

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
some range so next up is the frost Nova

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
some range so next up is the frost Nova
so<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.520> guessing<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> first<00:01:15.210> Nova<00:01:15.659> just

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so I'm guessing the first Nova just

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
so I'm guessing the first Nova just
deals<00:01:16.290> damage<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:16.950> time<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.729> freezes

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
deals damage over time as it freezes

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
deals damage over time as it freezes
bones<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> stuck<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> ground<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.130> know

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
bones of stuck to the ground you know

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
bones of stuck to the ground you know
some<00:01:20.460> sort<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> frostbite<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.689> again<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.049> very

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
some sort of frostbite but again a very

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.740 
some sort of frostbite but again a very
useful<00:01:22.560> attack<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.130> ask<00:01:23.340> me<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.390> next<00:01:24.600> up

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
useful attack if you ask me so next up

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240 
useful attack if you ask me so next up
is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> energy<00:01:25.380> wave<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> energy<00:01:26.130> wave

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is the energy wave and the energy wave

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
is the energy wave and the energy wave
is<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.820> when<00:01:27.450> monsters<00:01:27.869> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is something you use when monsters are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
is something you use when monsters are
too<00:01:28.080> close<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.130> mate

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
too close to you because of mate

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.010 
too close to you because of mate
mostly<00:01:30.000> estranged<00:01:30.450> tech<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:30.780> want

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
mostly estranged tech you don't want

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.359 
mostly estranged tech you don't want
monster<00:01:31.229> standing<00:01:31.530> too<00:01:31.680> close<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
monster standing too close to you so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.560 
monster standing too close to you so
that's<00:01:32.520> why<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> energy<00:01:33.210> wave<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> very

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that's why the energy wave is very

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.469 
that's why the energy wave is very
useful<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.770> again<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.700> starting<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.360> think

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
useful and again I'm starting to think

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
useful and again I'm starting to think
that<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> game<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:38.790> know

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that this game is more like a you know

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
that this game is more like a you know
if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> tank<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> DPSS

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
if you have the tank you have the DPSS

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
if you have the tank you have the DPSS
shifter<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> mages<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.840> all

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
shifter the mages you have like all

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
shifter the mages you have like all
these<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.590> different<00:01:43.890> classes<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
these kind of different classes and you

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
these kind of different classes and you
need<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> work<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.180> well<00:01:45.750> together<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
need to work really well together you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
need to work really well together you
want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> defeat<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> boss<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.790> guessing

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
want to defeat a boss so I'm guessing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.160 
want to defeat a boss so I'm guessing
the<00:01:48.180> bottom<00:01:48.479> looks<00:01:48.630> completely<00:01:48.990> different

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the bottom looks completely different

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
the bottom looks completely different
for<00:01:49.530> my<00:01:49.619> purse<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:49.920> yesterday's<00:01:50.280> today<00:01:50.600> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
for my purse or yesterday's today so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
for my purse or yesterday's today so
next<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.020> infinity<00:01:52.680> Kumbi<00:01:53.369> double

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
next up is infinity Kumbi double

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.039 
next up is infinity Kumbi double
infinity<00:01:53.700> scale<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.360> maplestory<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
infinity scale from maplestory but this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
infinity scale from maplestory but this
time<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> looks<00:01:55.560> somewhat<00:01:55.770> different<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.490> look

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
time it looks somewhat different it look

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
time it looks somewhat different it look
like<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> buff<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.420> something<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.750> charge

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
like the buff or something you charge

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
like the buff or something you charge
and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.649> pops<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> ground<00:01:59.759> there

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and then I just pops to the ground there

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999 
and then I just pops to the ground there
not<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.329> time<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.960> three<00:02:01.320> times<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
not one time but like three times it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.260 
not one time but like three times it
looks<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.430> days<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> short

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
looks like they are days for a short

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
looks like they are days for a short
period<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.600> time<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.920> next<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.399> teleport

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
period of time so next up is teleport

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.039 
period of time so next up is teleport
teleport<00:02:06.090> doesn't<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.689> need<00:02:06.840> any

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
teleport doesn't really need any

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
teleport doesn't really need any
explanation<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.310> teleport<00:02:08.879> from<00:02:08.970> one

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
explanation you just teleport from one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
explanation you just teleport from one
location<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> other<00:02:09.810> very<00:02:10.319> useful<00:02:10.410> again

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
location to the other very useful again

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.630 
location to the other very useful again
to<00:02:11.069> evade<00:02:11.340> boss<00:02:11.760> attacks

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
to evade boss attacks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.910 
to evade boss attacks
and<00:02:12.730> next<00:02:13.480> ups<00:02:13.660> concentration<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and next ups concentration and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.530 
and next ups concentration and
concentration<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.210> same<00:02:16.390> as

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
concentration is just like the same as

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.150 
concentration is just like the same as
in<00:02:16.660> maplestory<00:02:16.930> they<00:02:17.260> just<00:02:17.470> boost<00:02:17.650> your<00:02:17.800> magic

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
in maplestory they just boost your magic

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.590 
in maplestory they just boost your magic
attack<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.670> probably<00:02:18.940> also<00:02:19.090> your<00:02:19.300> magic

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
attack and probably also your magic

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.449 
attack and probably also your magic
defense<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.140> at<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.290> end<00:02:20.319> again<00:02:20.470> we're<00:02:21.280> not

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
defense but at the end again we're not

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.670 
defense but at the end again we're not
sure<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.360> that's<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.260> mages
