this you'll need a box a cube you'll

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.230 
this you'll need a box a cube you'll
need<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.639> tape

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
need some tape

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390 
need some tape
I<00:00:15.269> used<00:00:15.690> packing<00:00:16.350> tape<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.220> any

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I used packing tape on this but any

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.330 
I used packing tape on this but any
clear<00:00:17.730> tape<00:00:18.029> will<00:00:18.210> work<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.390> fine<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.340> some

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
clear tape will work just fine and some

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.480 
clear tape will work just fine and some
paper<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:21.029> used<00:00:21.630> colored<00:00:22.320> paper<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.220> mine

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
paper I used colored paper on mine

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
paper I used colored paper on mine
because<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.779> works<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.170> color

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
because I think it works on color

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
because I think it works on color
recognition<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.460> learning<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> different

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
recognition and learning the different

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.679 
recognition and learning the different
colors<00:00:28.189> but<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.460> use<00:00:29.640> any<00:00:29.939> paper<00:00:30.210> any
