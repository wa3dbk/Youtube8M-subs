00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
they still look sexy but it's not

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.460 
they still look sexy but it's not
obvious<00:00:49.150> concept<00:00:50.150> didn't<00:00:50.540> change<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.080> makeup

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
obvious concept didn't change the makeup

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.330

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
I kept the look natural because they're

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.540 
I kept the look natural because they're
meant<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.200> be<00:00:54.320> rolling<00:00:54.890> around<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.520> sand

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
meant to be rolling around in the sand

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.000 
meant to be rolling around in the sand
and<00:00:56.120> playing<00:00:56.390> at<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.660> beach<00:00:56.840> hair<00:00:57.620> reads

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
and playing at the beach hair reads

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.230 
and playing at the beach hair reads
differently<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.730> black<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.150> white

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
differently in black and white

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.810 
differently in black and white
especially<00:00:59.690> like<00:01:00.470> when<00:01:00.620> it's<00:01:00.770> wet<00:01:01.040> you<00:01:01.640> can

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
especially like when it's wet you can

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.460 
especially like when it's wet you can
actually<00:01:01.970> have<00:01:02.360> their<00:01:02.540> hair<00:01:02.720> a<00:01:02.750> little<00:01:03.080> less

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually have their hair a little less

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.289 
actually have their hair a little less
wet<00:01:03.800> but<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.100> will<00:01:04.250> look<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.549> lot<00:01:04.670> wetter<00:01:04.909> than

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
wet but it will look a lot wetter than

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.060 
wet but it will look a lot wetter than
black<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> white<00:01:05.900> when<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.740> hair<00:01:06.980> is<00:01:07.040> a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
black and white when the hair is a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.170 
black and white when the hair is a
little<00:01:07.190> darker<00:01:07.760> their<00:01:07.910> hair<00:01:08.030> can<00:01:08.150> look

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
little darker their hair can look

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.900 
little darker their hair can look
completely<00:01:08.630> black<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.320> if<00:01:09.800> I<00:01:10.010> made<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.700> head

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
completely black so if I made the head

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.060 
completely black so if I made the head
too<00:01:11.660> too<00:01:11.900> wet<00:01:12.110> then<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.440> would<00:01:12.560> become<00:01:12.710> like

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
too too wet then it would become like

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.410 
too too wet then it would become like
super<00:01:13.490> black<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.880> picture<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.300> you'd
