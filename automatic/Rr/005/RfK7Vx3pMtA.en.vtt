00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
off all those assists I was running

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.000 
off all those assists I was running
without<00:03:17.580> any<00:03:17.850> assists<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.650> except

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
without any assists and in this except

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.010 
without any assists and in this except
from<00:03:20.100> auto<00:03:20.280> clutch<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.030> was<00:03:21.600> running<00:03:21.870> through

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
from auto clutch I was running through

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.230 
from auto clutch I was running through
yeah<00:03:22.620> without<00:03:22.830> any<00:03:23.190> assists<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.090> know<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
yeah without any assists so you know I

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.790 
yeah without any assists so you know I
think<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.720> pretty<00:03:24.900> good<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.650> lot

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
think it's pretty good it's really a lot

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.020 
think it's pretty good it's really a lot
of<00:03:25.890> fun<00:03:26.070> without<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.490> assistant<00:03:26.910> it's

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
of fun without the assistant it's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.200 
of fun without the assistant it's
definitely<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> good<00:03:27.660> challenge<00:03:29.090> got<00:03:30.090> some

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
definitely a good challenge got some

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.120 
definitely a good challenge got some
other<00:03:30.330> options<00:03:30.660> as<00:03:30.750> well<00:03:30.900> damage<00:03:31.380> level<00:03:31.770> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
other options as well damage level you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.370 
other options as well damage level you
can<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.490> on<00:03:32.580> visual<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.390> obviously<00:03:34.110> it

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
can have it on visual so obviously it

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.870 
can have it on visual so obviously it
looks<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.010> has<00:03:35.130> damage<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.760> actually

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
looks like it has damage but it actually

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.550 
looks like it has damage but it actually
doesn't<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.570> makes<00:03:36.750> any<00:03:36.900> sense<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.350> called

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
doesn't that makes any sense it's called

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.560 
doesn't that makes any sense it's called
cosmetic<00:03:38.100> damage<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.480> on

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
cosmetic damage and you can have it on

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.960 
cosmetic damage and you can have it on
full<00:03:39.810> damage<00:03:40.200> where<00:03:40.410> your<00:03:40.590> car<00:03:40.830> does<00:03:41.790> look

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
full damage where your car does look

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.790 
full damage where your car does look
damaged<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:43.290> damaged<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
damaged and it actually is damaged it

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.860 
damaged and it actually is damaged it
can<00:03:43.980> also<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.280> destroy<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.330> engine<00:03:45.480> what

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
can also you destroy the engine what

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.990 
can also you destroy the engine what
sort<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.080> stuff<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.010> that's<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.490> there<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.760> well

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
sort of stuff so that's in there as well

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.270 
sort of stuff so that's in there as well
I<00:03:48.420> our<00:03:48.570> difficulty<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.860> it's<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.160> a

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
I our difficulty I think it's like a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.240 
I our difficulty I think it's like a
mature<00:03:50.550> medium<00:03:51.480> hard<00:03:52.230> very<00:03:52.710> hard<00:03:52.800> or

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
mature medium hard very hard or

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.040 
mature medium hard very hard or
something<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.690> think<00:03:54.930> that's

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
something like that is so I think that's

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.540 
something like that is so I think that's
four<00:03:55.200> or<00:03:55.320> five<00:03:55.500> difficulties<00:03:56.130> can't<00:03:56.340> remember

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
four or five difficulties can't remember

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.600 
four or five difficulties can't remember
exactly<00:03:56.940> but<00:03:57.470> very<00:03:58.470> hard<00:03:58.740> I'll<00:03:59.010> tell<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.220> is

very hard it took Alex good about pre
about<00:04:03.150> three<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.620> know<00:04:04.710> three<00:04:04.920> or<00:04:04.950> four<00:04:05.160> hours

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
difficulty doesn't look like it's going

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.200 
difficulty doesn't look like it's going
to<00:04:40.599> be<00:04:40.719> a<00:04:40.930> very<00:04:41.199> easy<00:04:41.800> game<00:04:42.159> to<00:04:42.189> max<00:04:42.849> out<00:04:43.090> one

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210

to be a very easy game to max out one
hundred<00:04:43.449> percent<00:04:43.479> and<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.080> slight<00:04:44.349> mistake

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
hundred percent and a slight mistake

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.439 
hundred percent and a slight mistake
there<00:04:44.919> I<00:04:45.099> went<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.759> right<00:04:45.879> hand<00:04:46.090> side<00:04:46.150> but

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
there I went to the right hand side but

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.589 
there I went to the right hand side but
slightly<00:04:46.930> tagged<00:04:47.319> the<00:04:47.800> raven<00:04:48.189> West<00:04:48.400> BMW<00:04:49.360> there

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
slightly tagged the raven West BMW there

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.450 
slightly tagged the raven West BMW there
which<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.960> bit<00:04:50.319> of<00:04:50.439> a<00:04:50.530> mistake<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:51.129> that<00:04:51.340> was

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
which is a bit of a mistake and that was

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.920 
which is a bit of a mistake and that was
a<00:04:51.490> mistake<00:04:51.610> as<00:04:51.939> well<00:04:52.120> cutting<00:04:52.539> across<00:04:52.719> the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
a mistake as well cutting across the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.920 
a mistake as well cutting across the
corner<00:04:53.310> anyway<00:04:54.310> we're<00:04:54.430> talking<00:04:54.729> about<00:04:54.930> other

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
corner anyway we're talking about other

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.409 
corner anyway we're talking about other
systems<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.740> talk<00:04:57.219> about<00:04:57.370> our<00:04:57.580> difficulty<00:04:58.240> or

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
systems to talk about our difficulty or

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.499 
systems to talk about our difficulty or
flashbacks<00:04:59.050> from<00:04:59.949> zero<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.639> five<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.449> then

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
flashbacks from zero to five and then

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.920 
flashbacks from zero to five and then
unlimited<00:05:02.409> so<00:05:02.949> I<00:05:03.250> probably<00:05:03.840> starting<00:05:04.840> off

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
unlimited so I probably starting off

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.510 
unlimited so I probably starting off
with<00:05:05.050> maybe<00:05:05.259> one<00:05:05.440> or<00:05:05.590> two<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.069> then<00:05:06.219> probably

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
with maybe one or two and then probably

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.879 
with maybe one or two and then probably
putting<00:05:06.879> it<00:05:07.000> down<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.270> zero<00:05:07.539> a<00:05:07.889> transmission

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
putting it down to zero a transmission

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.520 
putting it down to zero a transmission
you've<00:05:09.069> got<00:05:09.250> either<00:05:09.400> manual<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.210> automatic

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
you've got either manual to automatic

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.279 
you've got either manual to automatic
transmission<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:13.030> can<00:05:13.360> turn<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:14.080> HUD

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
transmission and you can turn the HUD

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.249 
transmission and you can turn the HUD
entirely<00:05:15.099> which<00:05:15.310> is<00:05:15.460> interesting<00:05:16.060> and

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
entirely which is interesting and

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.719 
entirely which is interesting and
obviously<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.440> can<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.949> huddle<00:05:18.430> if<00:05:18.610> you

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
obviously you can have the huddle if you

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.820 
obviously you can have the huddle if you
want<00:05:18.909> camera<00:05:19.569> position<00:05:19.990> as<00:05:20.139> a<00:05:20.169> wide<00:05:20.409> range<00:05:20.650> of

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
want camera position as a wide range of

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.740 
want camera position as a wide range of
obviously<00:05:21.219> cockpit<00:05:21.699> view<00:05:21.909> bonnet<00:05:22.449> camera

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
