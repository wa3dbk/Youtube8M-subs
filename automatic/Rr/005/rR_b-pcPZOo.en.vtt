00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
to recycle more to be more energy

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.330 
to recycle more to be more energy
efficient<00:00:32.480> wherever<00:00:32.750> possible<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.470> most

efficient wherever possible and most
times<00:00:34.640> when<00:00:34.730> we<00:00:34.850> think<00:00:35.030> about

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
times when we think about

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.270 
times when we think about
environmentally<00:00:36.320> friendly<00:00:36.620> products<00:00:37.129> we're

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
environmentally friendly products we're

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.740 
environmentally friendly products we're
thinking<00:00:37.550> about<00:00:37.640> products<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.449> are<00:00:38.600> made

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
thinking about products that are made

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.660 
thinking about products that are made
with<00:00:38.989> recycled<00:00:39.320> material<00:00:40.040> we're<00:00:40.489> talking

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
with recycled material we're talking

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.250 
with recycled material we're talking
about<00:00:40.820> products<00:00:41.330> that<00:00:41.360> are<00:00:41.780> either<00:00:41.930> hand

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
about products that are either hand

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.439 
about products that are either hand
powered<00:00:42.680> solar<00:00:43.040> powered<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.640> all<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.330> which

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
powered solar powered and all of which

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.180 
powered solar powered and all of which
are<00:00:44.570> available<00:00:44.720> at<00:00:45.110> motivators<00:00:45.559> calm<00:00:45.949> by<00:00:46.129> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
are available at motivators calm by the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.740 
are available at motivators calm by the
way<00:00:46.370> but<00:00:46.550> today<00:00:46.640> we<00:00:46.970> have<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.180> really<00:00:47.629> exciting

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
way but today we have a really exciting

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.979 
way but today we have a really exciting
and<00:00:48.230> unique<00:00:48.350> way<00:00:48.739> of<00:00:48.770> using<00:00:49.219> an<00:00:49.489> age-old<00:00:50.000> power

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
and unique way of using an age-old power

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.920 
and unique way of using an age-old power
source<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.160> one<00:00:52.480> now<00:00:53.480> most<00:00:53.750> of<00:00:53.840> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
source and that is one now most of the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.200 
source and that is one now most of the
time<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.350> think<00:00:54.500> about<00:00:54.800> water<00:00:55.129> being<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.760> source

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
time we think about water being a source

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.510 
time we think about water being a source
of<00:00:56.420> power<00:00:56.719> or<00:00:57.050> electricity<00:00:57.440> we<00:00:58.100> think<00:00:58.309> about

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
of power or electricity we think about

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.939 
of power or electricity we think about
the<00:00:58.699> large<00:00:59.059> wheels<00:00:59.390> that<00:00:59.899> led<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.440> generator

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
the large wheels that led to a generator

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.819 
the large wheels that led to a generator
that<00:01:01.399> created<00:01:01.910> electricity<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.680> not

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
that created electricity but this is not

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.869 
that created electricity but this is not
going<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.039> work<00:01:04.220> in<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:04.489> way<00:01:04.670> obviously

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
going to work in that way obviously

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.910 
going to work in that way obviously
because<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.259> water<00:01:06.560> powered

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
because this is a water powered

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160 
because this is a water powered
calculator<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.670> how<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.450> works<00:01:08.660> is<00:01:08.899> that<00:01:08.930> it

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
calculator and how it works is that it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.690 
calculator and how it works is that it
comes<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:09.440> this<00:01:09.680> little<00:01:09.740> apparatus<00:01:10.460> here

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
comes with this little apparatus here

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.070 
comes with this little apparatus here
that<00:01:10.910> kind<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.149> looks<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.479> battery<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
that kind of looks like a battery and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.680 
that kind of looks like a battery and
what<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> do<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.490> unscrew<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.479> you

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
what you do is you unscrew it and you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.570 
what you do is you unscrew it and you
take<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.050> bottom<00:01:15.410> part<00:01:15.649> here<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.100> fill<00:01:16.460> it

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
take this bottom part here and fill it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.130 
take this bottom part here and fill it
most<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.090> way<00:01:17.240> with<00:01:17.420> water<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:17.929> it's<00:01:18.080> a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
most of the way with water so it's a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.170 
most of the way with water so it's a
very<00:01:18.410> little<00:01:18.710> amount<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.009> water<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.000> you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
very little amount of water and then you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.710 
very little amount of water and then you
just<00:01:20.659> screw<00:01:21.380> it<00:01:21.470> right<00:01:21.530> back<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:22.659> open<00:01:23.659> up

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
just screw it right back in and open up

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.950 
just screw it right back in and open up
the<00:01:23.869> back<00:01:24.020> here<00:01:25.030> pop<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.210> bad<00:01:26.450> boy<00:01:26.720> in

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
the back here pop this bad boy in

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.060 
the back here pop this bad boy in
basically<00:01:27.650> as<00:01:27.860> if<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.220> were<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.400> battery<00:01:28.820> and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
basically as if it were a battery and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.289 
basically as if it were a battery and
close<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.250> right<00:01:31.340> back<00:01:31.520> up<00:01:31.579> again<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.210> you

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
close it right back up again and you

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.789 
close it right back up again and you
have<00:01:32.450> yourself<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.960> fully<00:01:33.229> functioning

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
have yourself a fully functioning

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.830 
have yourself a fully functioning
calculator<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:35.090> doesn't<00:01:35.329> need<00:01:35.390> any<00:01:35.479> light<00:01:35.810> to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
calculator it doesn't need any light to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.749 
calculator it doesn't need any light to
work<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.619> even<00:01:37.100> though<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.220> battery<00:01:37.520> life<00:01:37.729> is

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
work and even though the battery life is

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.700 
work and even though the battery life is
gonna<00:01:38.119> last<00:01:38.329> quite<00:01:38.600> sometime<00:01:38.900> if<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> screen

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
gonna last quite sometime if the screen

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.440 
gonna last quite sometime if the screen
starts<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.100> feed<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.640> all<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.090> have<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.299> do
