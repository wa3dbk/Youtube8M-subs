00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
correct position very good I also have
two<00:00:53.039> corners<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.760> their<00:00:53.910> diagonal<00:00:54.510> that's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
two corners but their diagonal that's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.270

okay how do you know if they're in the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.709 
okay how do you know if they're in the
correct<00:00:56.550> position<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> three

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
correct position them because the three

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.660 
correct position them because the three
colors<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> corner<00:00:58.920> pieces<00:00:59.100> match<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
colors on the corner pieces match the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
colors on the corner pieces match the
center<00:00:59.940> pieces<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.449> each<00:01:00.600> side<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.199> there

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
center pieces on each side well there

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
center pieces on each side well there
you<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.620> good<00:01:01.859> job<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.280> guys<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> we've

you go good job you guys now that we've

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
you go good job you guys now that we've
identified<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.930> corners<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> correct

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
identified the corners in the correct

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
identified the corners in the correct
position<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.760> first<00:01:06.060> step<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.659> hold<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
position the first step is to hold the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.830 
position the first step is to hold the
cube<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> correct<00:01:07.979> position<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.659> have

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
cube in the correct position if you have

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
cube in the correct position if you have
the<00:01:09.960> correct<00:01:10.170> corners<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:11.070> side

the correct corners on the same side

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
the correct corners on the same side
then<00:01:11.820> hold<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> cube<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.650> correct

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then hold the cube so that to correct

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
then hold the cube so that to correct

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
again one of the more common mistakes is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.729 
again one of the more common mistakes is
moving<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.359> cube<00:03:01.630> around<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.140> your<00:03:02.230> hand<00:03:02.470> when

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
moving the cube around in your hand when

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.039 
moving the cube around in your hand when
making<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.250> moves<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.030> remember<00:03:04.630> you're

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
making the moves so remember you're

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.819 
making the moves so remember you're
rotating<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.799> faces<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.299> cube<00:03:07.690> go<00:03:08.620> ahead

and three edge pieces that are incorrect

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.289 
and three edge pieces that are incorrect
or<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.109> have<00:03:41.319> all<00:03:41.620> four<00:03:42.040> edge<00:03:42.310> pieces<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:43.060> the

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
or you have all four edge pieces in the

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.740 
or you have all four edge pieces in the
wrong<00:03:43.540> position

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
wrong position

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.050

and<00:03:45.080> what<00:03:45.470> situation<00:03:46.070> do<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.250> guys<00:03:46.460> have<00:03:46.730> I

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and what situation do you guys have I

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.880 
and what situation do you guys have I
have<00:03:47.390> one<00:03:47.570> edge<00:03:47.750> piece<00:03:48.020> that's<00:03:48.290> correct

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
have one edge piece that's correct

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.890 
have one edge piece that's correct
I<00:03:48.920> have<00:03:49.430> all<00:03:49.640> four<00:03:49.880> edge<00:03:50.060> pieces<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.780> are

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
I have all four edge pieces that are

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.750 
I have all four edge pieces that are
incorrect<00:03:51.350> okay<00:03:51.920> that's<00:03:52.130> good<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.610> have

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
incorrect okay that's good and I have

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.430 
incorrect okay that's good and I have
one<00:03:53.000> edge<00:03:53.150> piece<00:03:53.390> that's<00:03:53.630> correct<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.410> let's

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
one edge piece that's correct so let's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.950 
one edge piece that's correct so let's
solve<00:03:54.830> both<00:03:55.100> situations<00:03:55.820> first<00:03:56.360> let's<00:03:56.720> solve

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
solve both situations first let's solve

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.780 
solve both situations first let's solve
the<00:03:57.110> one<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.410> all<00:03:57.620> four<00:03:57.980> edge<00:03:58.190> pieces<00:03:58.490> that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
the one with all four edge pieces that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.490 
the one with all four edge pieces that
are<00:03:58.880> incorrect<00:03:59.390> because<00:03:59.990> we<00:04:00.140> need<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.410> have

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
are incorrect because we need to have

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.290 
are incorrect because we need to have
one<00:04:00.740> edge<00:04:00.920> piece<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.550> correct<00:04:01.850> position

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
one edge piece in the correct position

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.390 
one edge piece in the correct position
eventually<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.560> do<00:04:03.740> this<00:04:03.890> we<00:04:04.100> need<00:04:04.280> to

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
eventually so to do this we need to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.830 
eventually so to do this we need to
follow<00:04:04.580> either<00:04:04.940> one<00:04:05.240> of<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.450> sequential

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
follow either one of the sequential

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.170 
follow either one of the sequential
moves<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.500> solution<00:04:06.980> guide<00:04:07.130> since<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
moves in the solution guide since it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.060 
moves in the solution guide since it
doesn't<00:04:08.600> matter<00:04:08.780> which<00:04:09.080> sequence<00:04:09.620> we<00:04:09.800> use

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
doesn't matter which sequence we use

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.040 
doesn't matter which sequence we use
when<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:10.460> are<00:04:10.610> four<00:04:11.000> incorrect<00:04:11.840> edge

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
when there are four incorrect edge

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.350 
when there are four incorrect edge
pieces<00:04:12.380> we'll<00:04:13.190> do<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.460> first<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.210> the
