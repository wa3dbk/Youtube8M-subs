how did you learn to do it kind of on
the<00:01:28.190> street<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.030> also<00:01:29.180> did<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.450> lot<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.600> rally

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
the street and I also did a lot of rally

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.410 
the street and I also did a lot of rally
and<00:01:30.320> that's<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.160> kind<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.580> drifting<00:01:32.000> city<00:01:32.360> is

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
and that's a kind of drifting city is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.360 
and that's a kind of drifting city is
just<00:01:32.570> not<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.380> where<00:01:33.620> I<00:01:33.650> learned<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.280> that

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
just not that's where I learned it that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.190 
just not that's where I learned it that
I<00:01:34.490> do<00:01:34.550> all<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.000> street<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.510> all<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.870> you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
I do all of the street and all this you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
I do all of the street and all this you
know<00:01:36.230> what

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.700 

the<00:01:40.090> slippery<00:01:40.540> conditions<00:01:40.750> actually<00:01:41.560> make

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
the slippery conditions actually make

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.469 
the slippery conditions actually make
drifting<00:01:42.190> harder<00:01:42.729> because<00:01:43.000> you're<00:01:43.240> more

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
drifting harder because you're more

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.410 
drifting harder because you're more
likely<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.960> spit<00:01:44.440> out<00:01:45.090> sitting<00:01:46.090> alongside

likely to spit out sitting alongside

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.540 
likely to spit out sitting alongside
Kenneth<00:01:46.990> teaches<00:01:47.590> me<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.860> drifting<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
Kenneth teaches me that drifting in the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.120 
Kenneth teaches me that drifting in the
wet<00:01:48.790> requires<00:01:49.479> even<00:01:49.750> smoother<00:01:50.619> throttle<00:01:51.009> and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
wet requires even smoother throttle and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.010 
wet requires even smoother throttle and
steering<00:01:51.190> control<00:01:51.970> than<00:01:52.390> drifting<00:01:52.810> in<00:01:52.930> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
steering control than drifting in the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.170 
steering control than drifting in the
dry<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.820> smooth<00:01:55.240> big<00:01:56.140> angle<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.880> give<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.149> a
