00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.420 

so<00:01:04.870> time<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.560> drag<00:01:05.770> race<00:01:05.800> now<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.220> area's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
so time for a drag race now the area's

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.070 
so time for a drag race now the area's
got<00:01:06.550> more<00:01:06.700> talk<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.600> I'll<00:01:07.690> see<00:01:07.870> it's<00:01:07.960> got

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
got more talk and I'll see it's got

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.240 
got more talk and I'll see it's got
four-wheel<00:01:08.320> drive<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.710> you'll<00:01:09.040> see<00:01:09.160> that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
four-wheel drive and you'll see that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.800 
four-wheel drive and you'll see that
conditions<00:01:09.640> are<00:01:09.760> really<00:01:09.910> wet<00:01:10.210> really<00:01:10.600> greasy

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
conditions are really wet really greasy

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.750 
conditions are really wet really greasy
lots<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.290> leaves<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:12.070> doesn't<00:01:12.370> play<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.550> the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
lots of leaves it doesn't play to the

lots of leaves it doesn't play to the
BMW's<00:01:13.240> advantage<00:01:13.780> but<00:01:14.380> let's<00:01:14.560> see<00:01:14.710> how<00:01:14.830> we<00:01:14.890> get

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
BMW's advantage but let's see how we get

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.020 
BMW's advantage but let's see how we get
on<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:19.060> yeah<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.510> mighty<00:01:20.020> off<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.410> line

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
on so yeah this is mighty off the line

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.570 
on so yeah this is mighty off the line
it's<00:01:22.240> already<00:01:22.690> 70<00:01:23.230> miles<00:01:23.410> an<00:01:23.590> hour<00:01:23.710> 80<00:01:24.220> miles

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
it's already 70 miles an hour 80 miles

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's already 70 miles an hour 80 miles
an<00:01:24.700> hour<00:01:24.850> oh<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:25.720> an<00:01:25.810> easy<00:01:25.960> win<00:01:26.380> over<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.710> BMW

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
an hour oh it's an easy win over the BMW

an hour oh it's an easy win over the BMW
so<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.860> Audi<00:01:30.010> won<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.729> really<00:01:31.060> straight-line

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
so the Audi won but really straight-line

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.090 
so the Audi won but really straight-line
pace<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.170> part<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.620> story

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
pace is just part of the story

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.010 
pace is just part of the story
it's<00:01:33.370> how<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.640> cars<00:01:34.000> make<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.300> feel<00:01:34.570> when<00:01:34.930> you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
it's how the cars make you feel when you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.510 
it's how the cars make you feel when you
drive<00:01:35.170> them<00:01:35.470> things<00:01:35.800> actually<00:01:36.100> more

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
drive them things actually more

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.000 
drive them things actually more
important<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.050> rx-7<00:01:38.350> won<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> drag<00:01:38.979> race

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
important so the rx-7 won the drag race

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.560 
important so the rx-7 won the drag race
but<00:01:39.400> what's<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:39.640> like<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.880> drive<00:01:39.970> on<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.360> back

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
but what's it like to drive on a back

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.630 
but what's it like to drive on a back
road<00:01:40.600> well<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.710> first<00:01:41.950> thing<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.130> they're<00:01:42.430> so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
road well the first thing is they're so

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.370 
road well the first thing is they're so
hard<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.970> utilize<00:01:43.510> its<00:01:43.720> performance<00:01:44.200> on<00:01:44.290> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
hard to utilize its performance on the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.850 
hard to utilize its performance on the
road

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
road

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.880 
road
it's<00:01:45.280> just<00:01:45.550> warps<00:01:46.030> be<00:01:46.240> fast<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:46.869> that's<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
it's just warps be fast so that's the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.820 
it's just warps be fast so that's the
first<00:01:48.130> thing<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.520> does<00:01:48.670> feel<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.360> little<00:01:50.260> bit

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
first thing it does feel a little bit

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.710 
first thing it does feel a little bit
faster<00:01:51.280> than<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.430> m6<00:01:51.910> but<00:01:52.119> it's<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.510> hard

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
faster than the m6 but it's just so hard

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.450 
faster than the m6 but it's just so hard
to<00:01:52.780> utilize<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.320> on<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.470> road<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.009> one<00:01:54.190> thing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
to utilize it on the road the one thing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.160 
to utilize it on the road the one thing
they<00:01:54.580> only<00:01:54.790> does<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.390> obviously<00:01:55.690> with

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
they only does have is obviously with

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.410 
they only does have is obviously with
Quattro<00:01:56.410> or<00:01:56.710> Drive<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.399> clever<00:01:57.729> sport

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
Quattro or Drive and that clever sport

don't get ascent to the road so it's a

comfortable<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.129> BMW<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.349> it's<00:02:31.349> quite

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
comfortable as the BMW so it's quite

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.289

hard<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.010> love<00:02:32.189> this<00:02:32.430> car<00:02:32.670> despite<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.120> fact

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
hard to love this car despite in fact

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.699 
hard to love this car despite in fact
the<00:02:33.360> engine<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.689> so<00:02:33.810> great<00:02:34.079> it's<00:02:34.319> really<00:02:34.349> hard

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
the engine is so great it's really hard

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.420 
the engine is so great it's really hard
to<00:02:34.860> love<00:02:35.069> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
to love it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
to love it
overall<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.599> Audi<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.230> incredibly<00:02:37.680> capable

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
overall the Audi one incredibly capable

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.009 
overall the Audi one incredibly capable
left<00:02:38.760> me<00:02:38.909> feeling<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.299> little<00:02:39.420> cold

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
left me feeling a little cold

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.350 
left me feeling a little cold
hopefully<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.769> BMW<00:02:41.340> will<00:02:41.579> be<00:02:41.610> more<00:02:41.849> fun

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
hopefully the BMW will be more fun

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.510 
hopefully the BMW will be more fun
okay<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:43.960> how<00:02:44.200> does<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.440> BMW<00:02:44.920> compare<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:45.430> we

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
okay so how does the BMW compare well we

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.010 
okay so how does the BMW compare well we
know<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> lost<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.180> drag<00:02:46.420> race<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.900> in

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
know it lost in the drag race but in

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.870 
know it lost in the drag race but in
reality<00:02:47.170> that's<00:02:47.950> been<00:02:48.190> primarily<00:02:48.460> because<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
reality that's been primarily because of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.100 
reality that's been primarily because of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the wet conditions and the factors

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.450 
the wet conditions and the factors
variable<00:02:50.470> drier<00:02:50.710> than<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.950> Audi's<00:02:51.220> without

BMW engine has a little bit more

character than the Audi engine and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.790 
character than the Audi engine and
there's<00:03:01.660> certainly<00:03:02.020> more<00:03:02.170> character<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.620> the

there's certainly more character to the

driving experience it's not perfect
obviously<00:03:04.960> it<00:03:05.200> troubles<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.590> traction

obviously it troubles the traction

Audi you can enjoy more the steering's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.240 
Audi you can enjoy more the steering's
better<00:03:16.200> it's<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.290> bit<00:03:17.470> softer<00:03:17.920> than<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.130> Audi

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
better it's a bit softer than the Audi

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.190

rides better than the Audi it's just a

little bit more engaging to drive the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
biggest problem for this car in a way

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.350 
biggest problem for this car in a way
though<00:03:27.280> isn't<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.670> Audi<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.060> biggest

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
though isn't the Audi the biggest

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.730 
though isn't the Audi the biggest
problem<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.810> car<00:03:28.990> is<00:03:29.110> its<00:03:29.260> sister<00:03:29.560> car

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
problem for this car is its sister car

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.360 
problem for this car is its sister car
the<00:03:29.890> m5<00:03:30.250> because<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:31.330> car<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:32.370> substantially

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
the m5 because this car is substantially

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.280 
the m5 because this car is substantially
more<00:03:33.670> expensive<00:03:33.730> than<00:03:34.330> an<00:03:34.420> m5<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.050> it's<00:03:35.170> about

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
more expensive than an m5 so it's about

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.050 
more expensive than an m5 so it's about
twenty<00:03:35.620> five<00:03:35.770> thousand<00:03:36.280> pounds<00:03:36.580> more<00:03:36.760> than<00:03:36.970> an

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
twenty five thousand pounds more than an

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.150 
twenty five thousand pounds more than an
m5<00:03:37.240> so<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.170> yeh<00:03:38.260> doesn't<00:03:38.650> offer<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.920> huge

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
m5 so and yeh doesn't offer a huge

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.980 
m5 so and yeh doesn't offer a huge
amount<00:03:39.580> more<00:03:39.790> turn<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.810> driving

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
amount more turn to the driving

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.930 
amount more turn to the driving
experience<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.770> it's<00:03:42.280> hard<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.550> justify

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
experience so it's hard to justify

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.670 
experience so it's hard to justify
although<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.690> think<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.170> looks<00:03:44.380> great

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
although I think it looks great

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.040 
although I think it looks great
so<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> BMW<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.030> best<00:03:46.210> to<00:03:46.330> drive<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:46.900> it's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
so the BMW is the best to drive but it's

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.660 
so the BMW is the best to drive but it's
also<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.380> nicer<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.739> sitting<00:03:48.100> with<00:03:48.550> its

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
also the nicer to sitting with its

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.430 
also the nicer to sitting with its
stylish<00:03:49.030> interior<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.720> sports<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.230> wrap

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
stylish interior and sports you wrap

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.470 
stylish interior and sports you wrap
around<00:03:50.560> cockpit<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.580> Audi<00:03:51.820> still<00:03:52.030> feels<00:03:52.239> posh

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
around cockpit the Audi still feels posh

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.479 
around cockpit the Audi still feels posh
and<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.870> loaded<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:53.320> gadgets<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.340> just

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
and is loaded with gadgets but it just

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.699 
and is loaded with gadgets but it just
lacks<00:03:54.700> some<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> BMWs<00:03:55.570> wow<00:03:55.750> factor<00:03:56.260> but

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
lacks some of the BMWs wow factor but

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.380 
lacks some of the BMWs wow factor but
with<00:03:56.830> its<00:03:56.980> hatchback<00:03:57.370> boot<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.910> Audi<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.300> the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
with its hatchback boot the Audi is the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.760 
with its hatchback boot the Audi is the
more<00:03:58.510> practical<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.140> pair<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> Audi

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
more practical of the pair so the Audi

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.250 
more practical of the pair so the Audi
is<00:04:02.950> faster<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.730> more<00:04:03.850> practical<00:04:04.300> but<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.110> BMW

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
is faster and more practical but the BMW

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.140 
is faster and more practical but the BMW
is<00:04:05.620> better<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.920> drive<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.580> looks<00:04:06.940> more

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
is better to drive and looks more

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.530 
is better to drive and looks more
exclusive<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.440> which<00:04:08.590> one<00:04:08.830> should<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.400> choose

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
exclusive so which one should you choose

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.880 
exclusive so which one should you choose
okay<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.660> costs<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.989> lot<00:04:11.140> more<00:04:11.200> money<00:04:11.380> than<00:04:11.680> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
okay it costs a lot more money than the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.880 
okay it costs a lot more money than the
BMW<00:04:12.340> m5<00:04:12.700> but<00:04:13.330> we'd<00:04:13.570> go<00:04:13.780> for<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.080> m6<00:04:14.440> Gran<00:04:14.530> Coupe

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
BMW m5 but we'd go for the m6 Gran Coupe

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.120 
BMW m5 but we'd go for the m6 Gran Coupe
a<00:04:15.070> looks<00:04:15.820> great<00:04:16.120> sounds<00:04:16.660> fantastic<00:04:17.020> and<00:04:17.620> most

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
a looks great sounds fantastic and most

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.979 
a looks great sounds fantastic and most
importantly<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.820> all<00:04:18.940> it's<00:04:19.359> more<00:04:19.570> fun<00:04:19.810> to

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
importantly of all it's more fun to

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.370 
importantly of all it's more fun to
drive<00:04:20.169> than<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> Audi<00:04:20.709> rs7
