it keeps throwing that code I'll tell
you<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> found<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:22.010> my<00:00:23.010> number<00:00:23.070> three

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
you what I found out my number three

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.259 
you what I found out my number three
plug<00:00:23.670> wire<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.869> broke<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
plug wire is broke right there so and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
plug wire is broke right there so and
that<00:00:27.480> code<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:28.320> says<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> misfire

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that code actually says it's a misfire

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.880 
that code actually says it's a misfire
so<00:00:30.019> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> reason<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.590> having<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
so this is the reason I'm having the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.620 
so this is the reason I'm having the
misfire<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> put<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> new<00:00:33.420> plug

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
misfire so I'm going to put a new plug

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
misfire so I'm going to put a new plug
wire<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:34.680> changing<00:00:35.219> them

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
wire on it I'm actually changing them

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
wire on it I'm actually changing them
all<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.170> then<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> reset<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
all and then I'm going to reset the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
all and then I'm going to reset the
computer<00:00:38.040> how<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> reset<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.000> computer

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
computer how do you reset the computer

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
computer how do you reset the computer
after<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> doesn't<00:00:40.649> throw

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
after you do this so it doesn't throw

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
after you do this so it doesn't throw

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it back on that code will clear I've

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090 
it back on that code will clear I've
heard<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> comments<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:49.980> other

didn't fix the problem the code will

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
didn't fix the problem the code will
come<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.860> happen<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> code

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
come back what will happen is the code

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
come back what will happen is the code
will<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> gone<00:01:57.210> no<00:01:57.450> matter<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> codes

an<00:02:04.890> hour<00:02:05.009> might<00:02:05.399> take<00:02:05.610> two<00:02:05.759> days<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
an hour might take two days but if the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
an hour might take two days but if the
code<00:02:07.079> does<00:02:07.409> come<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.489> there's<00:02:08.670> another

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
code does come back then there's another

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.420 
code does come back then there's another
issue<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> vehicle<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.200> well<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.009> find

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
issue with the vehicle as well so find

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.339 
issue with the vehicle as well so find
the<00:02:11.550> other<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.170> doesn't

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
the other one as well but if it doesn't

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.820 
the other one as well but if it doesn't
come<00:02:13.620> back

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
come back

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
come back
then<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.130> fix<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> problem<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.000> you're<00:02:15.510> not

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
then you fix the problem and you're not

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.090 
then you fix the problem and you're not
going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> hurt<00:02:16.200> your<00:02:16.320> computer<00:02:16.800> you're<00:02:16.950> not

going to hurt your computer you're not
going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> hurt<00:02:17.400> nothing<00:02:17.790> once<00:02:18.210> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
going to hurt nothing once you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.940 
going to hurt nothing once you
disconnect<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:19.020> thing<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.350> put<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.500> back<00:02:19.710> in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
disconnect this thing and put it back in

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.260 
disconnect this thing and put it back in
you've<00:02:20.190> reset<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.670> yourself<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.210> like

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you've reset it yourself it's like
