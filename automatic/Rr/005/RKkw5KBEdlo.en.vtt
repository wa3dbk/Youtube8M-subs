00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:09.480
 I am osvaldo and good in this video 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.690
 I bring a new one Boxing 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 from a source of power and good 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.340
 let's start at the source is pixar edition 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.340
 monsters 800 watts extra brand picks 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.980
 this low-end source has a camera 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.230
 high 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 middle range here as you can see 800 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.240
 extra watts floor mark 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.840
 how can they see power and performance 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.600
 extreme 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.300
 and good here specifications the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.150
 protection fans on my cable with 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.940
 coating that I think is cabree 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.170
 main or be the 24 pins protection 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.900
 super silent total would be the jumps or 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.910
 jumps better said there is pci-express 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.379
 well here in the back they can 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 see the connector 24 plus 24 pins two 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 pci-express connectors 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.640
 same account with ata serial connector 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.500
 sata I think 36 and with voter of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.980
 Perimeter energy from I think it brings 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.980
 two tickets 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 good the connector of 12 volts by 2 or 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 be 8 pins of 44 and a floppy connector 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.280
 that if I do not know what it's for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.500
 so good we proceed to open 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.840
 and good as you can see that's from the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 company where I bought a small sheet 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.880
 and there they have it, it's time to take it out 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.680
 ready already have the power cord 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.940
 and user manual and guarantees for 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.549
 part of the company of this product 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.540
 how will connect and things like that the cable 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.619
 energy as I had already mentioned 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.930
 before and since they have a fan 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.350
 back and one but it depends as the 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.909
 make clear because there are sources of 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.160
 power that can be down the cabinet u 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.899
 others at the top and good is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.290
 that unclog the wires to show the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 tickets 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.549
 good is how you can see is the connector 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 of 24 pins for the motherboard when 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.290
 so to give it energy as I said in 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.430
 the packaging covered that cable 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.430
 Main one could say 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.490
 and the pci-express connectors for the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.050
 video cards that I'm going to 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.290
 work one for my video card and 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.290
 they are good for that are these connectors 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.120
 the serial ata bone bind that contains 6 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.790
 this power source brings six 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.440
 connectors of those data because good since 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.440
 are the most used either in 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.470
 dvd and blu-ray players hard drives 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.580
 etc 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:08.080
 at 12 volts of 2 x 2 or 8 each 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.780
 They are 4 to floppy and the molex connectors 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.390
 that those were good are older 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.970
 that tie them you could say now it 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.850
 they occupied more the highs than the moles and 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.490
 well there they have the power source 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.980
 it costs around 800 750 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.450
 pesos here in Mexico and it is a great 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.450
 Thank you and goodbye
