actually<00:01:32.430> win<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> game<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:34.290> still

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
actually win the game of that I'm still

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually win the game of that I'm still
a<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.799> unsure<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> whether<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.360> might

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
a bit unsure as to whether he might

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.730 
a bit unsure as to whether he might
never<00:01:36.750> saw<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.619> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
never saw them off from because like I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.109 
never saw them off from because like I
say<00:01:37.890> he<00:01:37.979> had<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:38.340> cards<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.640> his<00:01:38.729> hand<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
say he had two cards in his hand for a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
say he had two cards in his hand for a
long<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> figured<00:01:40.439> there<00:01:40.740> might<00:01:40.860> be

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
long time so I figured there might be

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
long time so I figured there might be
some<00:01:41.159> offerings<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.780> luckily<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> couple<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060

terms ago I drew the pacifism so I'm
going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.210> use<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:46.710> put<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> his

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
- because he's in bad port position I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.060 
- because he's in bad port position I
can't<00:03:20.110> really<00:03:20.260> tell<00:03:20.440> much<00:03:20.590> life<00:03:20.800> he's<00:03:20.950> got

there<00:03:21.250> cuz<00:03:21.459> my<00:03:21.580> screen<00:03:21.940> I'm<00:03:22.270> looking<00:03:22.510> at<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
there cuz my screen I'm looking at the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.210 
there cuz my screen I'm looking at the
moments<00:03:22.930> quite<00:03:23.020> small<00:03:23.260> looks<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.500> six<00:03:24.010> or

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
moments quite small looks like six or

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.540 
moments quite small looks like six or
eight<00:03:24.400> or<00:03:24.430> seven<00:03:24.670> or<00:03:24.970> eight<00:03:25.150> hours<00:03:25.450> T's<00:03:25.630> more

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
eight or seven or eight hours T's more

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.100 
eight or seven or eight hours T's more
yeah<00:03:27.550> he's<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.060> low<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.360> life<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.720> figured

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
yeah he's on low and life so I figured

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.170 
yeah he's on low and life so I figured
that<00:03:29.230> he<00:03:29.260> yeah<00:03:29.650> straight<00:03:30.040> away<00:03:30.160> Psalms<00:03:31.000> of

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
that he yeah straight away Psalms of

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.479 
that he yeah straight away Psalms of
Solomon<00:03:31.239> offerings<00:03:32.080> gets<00:03:32.739> for<00:03:33.040> life<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
Solomon offerings gets for life and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.160 
Solomon offerings gets for life and
guesses<00:03:33.880> dude<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.239> basically<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.840> he<00:03:34.930> thinks

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
guesses dude that basically so he thinks

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.960 
guesses dude that basically so he thinks
he's<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.290> good<00:03:35.500> shape<00:03:35.680> especially<00:03:36.430> after<00:03:36.760> I've

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
he's in good shape especially after I've

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.330 
he's in good shape especially after I've
expressed<00:03:37.360> my<00:03:37.870> dismay<00:03:38.320> at<00:03:38.500> him<00:03:38.650> destroyed<00:03:39.130> my

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
expressed my dismay at him destroyed my

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.430 
expressed my dismay at him destroyed my
daughter<00:03:39.520> nothingness<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.050> figure

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
daughter nothingness and now I figure

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.860 
daughter nothingness and now I figure
most<00:03:42.400> people<00:03:42.730> probably<00:03:42.880> won't<00:03:43.060> run<00:03:43.420> three

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
most people probably won't run three

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.540 
most people probably won't run three
told<00:03:44.440> him<00:03:44.560> offer<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:45.040> figure<00:03:45.280> two<00:03:45.430> is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
told him offer and I figure two is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.680 
told him offer and I figure two is
probably<00:03:45.640> enough<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.150> most<00:03:46.269> decks

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
probably enough in most decks

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.810 
probably enough in most decks
I've<00:03:47.560> only<00:03:47.680> got<00:03:47.830> one<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:48.070> my<00:03:48.190> deck<00:03:48.370> presently

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
I've only got one in my deck presently

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.060 
I've only got one in my deck presently
and<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> decided<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.230> slap<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.590> down<00:03:50.830> and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
and so I decided to slap this down and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.000 
and so I decided to slap this down and
he's<00:03:51.910> probably<00:03:52.060> thinking<00:03:52.239> our<00:03:52.630> God<00:03:53.380> why<00:03:53.739> did<00:03:53.950> I

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
he's probably thinking our God why did I

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.210 
he's probably thinking our God why did I
just<00:03:54.070> do<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.870> pacifism<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.980> was<00:03:57.070> quite
