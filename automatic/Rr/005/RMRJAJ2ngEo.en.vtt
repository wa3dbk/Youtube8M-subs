00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.480
 begins the story of a kid who 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.370
 never hello how about you guys in this video 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.650
 I'm going to show you how you can create 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.110
 missions within the online gta for 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.850
 play them with your friends 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.400
 what we will have to do is the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.050
 beta creator input as if we were to 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.460
 create a normal death game and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.240
 current 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.890
 once we get into the beta creator 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.040
 now you will see that we are determined 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.640
 options that are death heading back to 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.010
 gta online and from gta 5 to the story mode 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 but you see that nothing comes out that the last 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 is if I'm not wrong to go to the mode 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.190
 history 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 What we will do is enter into creating a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.290
 death game and as you can see I'm 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.970
 preparing to get out quickie and 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.559
 disconnect me quickie like in the trick 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.710
 of passing cars from the story mode to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.900
 online mode I will enter from the death and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.809
 as I entered deathmatch 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.989
 I will disconnect the session once it has 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.790
 disconnected I will leave him from the ps mode 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.710
 to enter the game again and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.509
 will begin to leave messages that has been 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.690
 lost the connection that tells you which 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.490
 I will accept them all and I will leave 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.080
 creator of missions as you have seen 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 what do i do 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 once leaving the creator of missions or 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 an error message will you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 you are accepting all of them and you see that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 now I have an invisible option below 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.780
 of the last one that that option what is 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.369
 he really is the mission creator 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 we will enter into that invisible option in 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.869
 that option that does not put anything but down 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
 yes that has its description and once 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.800
 let's go in we will see all types of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.570
 missions that can really be created 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.000
 within gta 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 but be careful because they do not work 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 only parachute jump works 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.280
 and the two below, then we will choose 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.619
 one of them and we will connect again 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.200
 to online gta once we have 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.210
 connected we'll see that it lets us create 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 the mission we will put the name 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.160
 we will create all that is not important every 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.260
 one that believes it as it pleases and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.629
 you will see many things will be done 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.220
 cool with this I see how I am 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.019
 simply creating a little jump with 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 parachute from the highest that is 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.450
 can it be grace 7 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 and once you have it created my advice 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.160
 staff and this I recommend you 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.980
 I strongly recommend that you do it 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.080
 is that instead of saving publish 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.000
 publish it directly because the play 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.770
 normally it has always happened to me 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 is hooked on saving and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.790
 post once we give you save or you 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.440
 demos to publish will tell us that it has 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.060
 saved and that little has been 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.680
 published depends on the option that you 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.510
 demos but we will stay there 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.160
 hooked to the play so publish it 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.080
 directly and then you go to rockstar 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.190
 from the computer and activate it in a 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.190
 moment from your account 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.370
 once you have it activated simply 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.340
 you enter gta go to missions activities 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.930
 of these marked wings and we already chose the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 little jumps of parachute or what we have 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 created each one we go to enjoy it 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.459
 so nothing you guys see is a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 pass 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.269
 We will try to take lots of tricks 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.459
 reputation with the missions are you 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.560
 created by us I hope you like it 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.689
 that we reveal the like button because 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.430
 is a trick the truth I think it has 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.139
 discovered a nexus subscriber like that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 Congratulations to the boy because the 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.849
 true that it has been a true machine 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.609
 a little hello guys and see you next time 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.189
 I was the mess his friends abused and not 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.040
 they found meaning there is nothing worse 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.500
 that a child consented these kings ask 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.900
 a gun and you feel that chill I do not 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.269
 like to be in that restless situation 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.489
 in which everything bothers you and you feel that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.739
 empty for his birthday party ever and I 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.260
 gave away on a date kills all his 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.750
 pets and you think they are things of kids already 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.209
 with 14 years old he tests his first cigar 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.109
 the 15 he was giving to respect in his 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.329
 neighborhood 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.130
 his parents worried he did not step on his 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.590
 house to everyone threatens 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.500
 his life has undergone a change all day 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.870
 he quarrels he sells drugs his health 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.910
 that shit wobbles if it's cool 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.910
 living on the street was destroyed
