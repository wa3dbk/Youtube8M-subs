 combine various shades of eyeliner 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.669
 they can bail this out the easy way 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.860

 but very very fast with the eyeliners 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 soft 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 start by applying a little bit of the base 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 cover mad in secret light in all the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.420
 face to eliminate imperfections 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 cover all those little granites 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 little spots that we do not like 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 so apply it very well in all your 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 face next let's correct 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 a little more the face with the base 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.580
 corrector to found in beige control 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 this base will serve us to hide 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.390
 fine dark circles suddenly a little 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 the redness that we have around the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.220
 nose or mouth and all those things 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.370
 they need a little extra help 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.980
 to correct there are many many 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.350
 brushes applicators for the base 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 corrector to but actually my favorite 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.759
 for ever and ever always go 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 to be the fingers it seems to me that the finish 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.220
 it is much more natural and applies 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 better the product since ccoo register 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.840
 your face with a control now let's 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.509
 use a shadow color 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.149
 it can be gray coffee, whatever you want me 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.210
 I'm using this gray from the palette of 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.829
 three o'clock shadows in watercolor is a 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.299
 super soft gray yes that gives 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.880
 I touch it with my finger 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.490
 in my eyelids now comes the part 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.340
 fun with soft eyeliners 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 many I will first take the soft look 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 in soft dwelling this purple color is divine 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.009
 Divine divine has a few 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.439
 flashes as well as super bright and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.750
 very cute and the color is very beautiful 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 let's make a cat line in the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.799
 top on the mobile eyelid well 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.469
 how many times is it necessary to pass one and 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.599
 again the color so that it looks good 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.750
 intense this color is to produce everything and 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.989
 So it's going to be left now to combine this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.569
 purple we will use software in soft 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.510
 tour quite is a turquoise color super 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.690
 cute I took the tip very finite 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 so that the delineated was thin 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.680
 I'm going to delineate below the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.780
 lower eyelashes and also inside 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 of the line 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 and with the dusts checkmate in my 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.030
 confidential I will seal the base and the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.450
 It looks great with the makeup of the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.850

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.090
 a little eyebrows and I'm going to do it with 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.640
 the fort mask and the fortin brown 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.010
 This is a quick and easy way girls 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.019

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.600
