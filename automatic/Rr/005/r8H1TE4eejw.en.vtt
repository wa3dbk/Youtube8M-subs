00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
kitchen sink you may have noticed that

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.090 
kitchen sink you may have noticed that
many<00:05:31.910> times<00:05:32.240> if<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.540> turn<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.870> water<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.230> so

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
many times if you turn the water on so

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.350 
many times if you turn the water on so
that<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.340> hits<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.640> bottom<00:05:34.970> of<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.090> sink

that it hits the bottom of the sink

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.430 
that it hits the bottom of the sink
you'll<00:05:36.320> notice<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:38.030> thick<00:05:38.570> ring<00:05:38.930> forms

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
you'll notice that a thick ring forms

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.230

getting thinner and at some point it has
