00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.960
 Morale decline as the bank account 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.370

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.680
 CDs of cassettes 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.330

 to be to all those who fare only at the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.490
 life is a puzzle and the ivory does not 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.320
 do not say I'm getting drunk 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.480

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.579

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.179
 six years old I hear from the tree 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.739
 red that the school of rhyme is nothing 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.199
 other than an emergency door 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.039

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.159

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.710
 initially it is plowing its beasts 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.780
 way of arrival we will be beasts of 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.859
 the race everything was calculated as the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.949
 fall of the stock market 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.920
 the real rap to a debt and we wait key

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.940
 if give the thumb of Caesar a few 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.649
 seconds of silence because my rap peace 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.050
 below they want me to continue 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.150
 sharma health the listeners here we fight 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.250
 arms screaming that what imposes and who 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.380
 continue to make us think small 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.820
 personal message I'm not the voice of 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.130
 the reason i am like checks 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 we have better horizons to keep 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 the cold head in all seasons 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 ida does not so proud because we 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.540
 crush each other 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.550
 it's hard to say but the street has no 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.440
 feelings that would be a weakness in 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.360
 the code means that this woman does not 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.640
 lack that this woman cheats me wide 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.860
 roof of a jewish mother of my children 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.350
 a resolution for the future must I 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.330
 stay polite ready for anything keep our 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.520
 heads we all dream of fucking cars 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.890
 and vicat troc solid me mine in 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.660
 two words is the grid but the football 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.760
 football if I say what I think 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.950
 most people and I take myself 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.850
 for a madman it's hard to say but must 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.520
 to make a figure 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 without going through the box site this bastard to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.300
 clary but it's better than the machine in 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.660
 closing my eyes I go around the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.000
 world 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.920
 donkey machine it is round palestro wedged 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.290
 on the instru he is too comfortable 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 without point dependent and she far from being 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.160
 over but worry that I'm barred 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.900
 in time it's not over I think it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 some rhymes are still packed 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.460
 I have enough said so I tell you in the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 next phase i remain serious if you 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.700
 see my clip on the channels calm 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.680
 Before the storm 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.020
 when it is unleashed to swallow 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 except rap is interim site of the meadow 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.580

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.580
 rhyme to the tnt disease
