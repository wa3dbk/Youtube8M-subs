better videos and after that video I
went<00:00:15.990> out<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.500> had<00:00:16.710> dinner<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.220> buddy

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
went out and I had dinner with a buddy

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.970 
went out and I had dinner with a buddy
of<00:00:17.550> mine<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.060> realized<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.470> issue<00:00:19.590> went

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of mine and realized that the issue went

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.880 
of mine and realized that the issue went
a<00:00:20.070> lot<00:00:20.220> deeper<00:00:20.279> than<00:00:20.789> me<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.630> being<00:00:22.590> nervous

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a lot deeper than me just being nervous

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.000 
a lot deeper than me just being nervous
I<00:00:23.400> figured<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.810> hate<00:00:25.529> letting<00:00:25.710> people

I figured out that I hate letting people

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
I figured out that I hate letting people
down<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.970> that's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.240> personality<00:00:27.930> trait<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
down just that's a personality trait of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
down just that's a personality trait of
mine<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> most<00:00:29.189> part<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.640> good

in<00:00:42.300> life<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.050> found<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.920> trait<00:00:44.250> was

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
in life but I found that this trait was

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
in life but I found that this trait was
hurting<00:00:44.910> me<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.239> making<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> videos<00:00:46.020> because

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
hurting me in making the videos because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.639 
hurting me in making the videos because
my<00:00:47.370> usual<00:00:47.910> process<00:00:48.420> before<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> recorded<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
my usual process before I recorded it

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
my usual process before I recorded it
myself<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> didn't<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> cameraman

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
myself when I didn't have a cameraman

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
myself when I didn't have a cameraman
was<00:00:51.780> before<00:00:52.469> each<00:00:52.649> question<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.399> pace

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
was before each question I would pace

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
was before each question I would pace
for<00:00:54.539> five<00:00:54.719> minutes<00:00:54.960> maybe<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.070> bit<00:00:56.250> less

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
for five minutes maybe a little bit less

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
for five minutes maybe a little bit less
and<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.480> wanted<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and just think about what I wanted to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.760 
and just think about what I wanted to
say<00:00:58.170> before<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.820> out<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.000> camera<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:01.350> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
say before I go out on camera and now I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
say before I go out on camera and now I
would<00:01:02.070> find<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.820> didn't<00:01:03.329> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> make

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
would find that I didn't want to make

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.130 
would find that I didn't want to make
Jason<00:01:04.199> wait<00:01:04.769> those<00:01:05.430> five<00:01:05.729> minutes<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.390> didn't

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
Jason wait those five minutes I didn't

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.660 
Jason wait those five minutes I didn't
want<00:01:07.320> him<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.680> bored<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.250> didn't<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
want him to be bored I didn't want to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
want him to be bored I didn't want to
let<00:01:08.790> him<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.049> why<00:01:10.229> what's<00:01:10.409> happened

life and your own business that hold you
back<00:02:17.950> you're<00:02:18.370> not<00:02:18.550> even<00:02:18.670> aware<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.690> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
back you're not even aware of so you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.259 
back you're not even aware of so you
can't<00:02:20.080> fix<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.739> until<00:02:20.830> you're<00:02:21.760> aware<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
can't fix it until you're aware of it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.850 
can't fix it until you're aware of it
and<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> first<00:02:23.080> step<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.769> would

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and so that's the first step and I would

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.979 
and so that's the first step and I would
encourage<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.400> think<00:02:24.430> about<00:02:24.670> what<00:02:25.120> are

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989
