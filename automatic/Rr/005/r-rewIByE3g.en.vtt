00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
apply this I will have to say I try with

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.930 
apply this I will have to say I try with
a<00:03:07.930> brush<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.530> stippling<00:03:08.920> brush<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.790> wasn't

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
a brush is stippling brush and it wasn't

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.410 
a brush is stippling brush and it wasn't
it<00:03:10.630> give<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.500> coverage<00:03:11.890> was<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.970> full

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
it give you coverage was not like a full

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.400 
it give you coverage was not like a full
complete<00:03:13.840> medium<00:03:14.260> coverage<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:16.450> find<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
