command<00:00:18.480> blocks<00:00:19.730> yeah

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
command blocks yeah

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
command blocks yeah
closer<00:00:21.900> um<00:00:23.269> game<00:00:24.269> mode<00:00:24.480> backs<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.080> creative

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
closer um game mode backs it creative

closer um game mode backs it creative
right<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:30.949> start<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.030> easy<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
right here start here so easy of just a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.770 
right here start here so easy of just a
simple<00:00:34.500> structure<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.780> we'll

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
simple structure right here and we'll

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.350 
simple structure right here and we'll
just<00:00:36.989> break<00:00:37.230> these<00:00:37.579> three<00:00:38.579> blocks<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
just break these three blocks really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
just break these three blocks really
because<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.690> only<00:00:40.320> took<00:00:40.559> two<00:00:40.860> command

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
because they only took two command

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
because they only took two command
blocks<00:00:43.070> alright<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> yeah<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
blocks alright so yeah this is the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
blocks alright so yeah this is the
looper<00:00:46.559> block<00:00:46.800> which<00:00:47.340> loops<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.030> command

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
looper block which loops of this command

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.880 
looper block which loops of this command
block<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> course<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> tests<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
block which is of course the tests for

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
block which is of course the tests for
command<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> does<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> tests<00:00:52.199> if

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
command and what it does the tests if

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.569 
command and what it does the tests if
the<00:00:52.980> player<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.550> within<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.239> one-block<00:00:55.140> radius

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
the player is within a one-block radius

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.990 
the player is within a one-block radius
or<00:00:56.579> within<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.480> block<00:00:57.629> search<00:00:58.500> radius<00:00:59.000> from

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
or within a one block search radius from

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
or within a one block search radius from
this<00:01:00.180> command<00:01:00.570> block<00:01:00.690> which<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> center

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this command block which is the center

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.320 
this command block which is the center
command<00:01:01.739> block<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:03.080> RX<00:01:04.080> +<00:01:04.650> RZ<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
command block the RX + RZ does that and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.820 
command block the RX + RZ does that and
then<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.890> Y<00:01:08.100> does<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.240> tests<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
then what are Y does is it tests if you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.929 
then what are Y does is it tests if you
are<00:01:11.130> directly<00:01:12.000> above<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.650> block<00:01:14.549> above

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
are directly above or like a block above

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.380 
are directly above or like a block above
the<00:01:15.240> command<00:01:15.540> block<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.210> right

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the command block now this does right

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.380 
the command block now this does right
here<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> tests<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:20.790> health<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> less

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
here is the tests if your health is less

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
here is the tests if your health is less
than<00:01:21.570> 20<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.710> fall

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
than 20 so if if you get some fall

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.520 
than 20 so if if you get some fall
damage<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.520> whatever<00:01:26.790> you'll<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.439> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
damage or whatever you'll you can go in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
damage or whatever you'll you can go in
here<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> refill<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.340> health<00:01:29.689> now<00:01:30.689> instead

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
here and refill your health now instead

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.210 
here and refill your health now instead
of<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> effect

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
of for just for just just for effect

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
of for just for just just for effect
instead<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.400> making<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.540> sets<00:01:37.320> your

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
instead of making it so it sets your

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.429 
instead of making it so it sets your
health<00:01:37.770> automatically<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> 20<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
health automatically to 20 you can

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
health automatically to 20 you can
choose<00:01:40.619> how<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.659> by<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:43.320> this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
choose how much you do by by this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
choose how much you do by by this
command<00:01:43.829> block<00:01:43.920> since<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> only<00:01:44.759> adds<00:01:44.970> one

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
command block since it only adds one

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.609 
command block since it only adds one
heart<00:01:45.630> every<00:01:46.170> time<00:01:46.880> or<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:49.200> half<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> a

heart every time or one one half of a
heart<00:01:49.740> every<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.430> let's<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.670> close

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
heart every time so let's just close

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.240

this back in
I<00:01:54.410> just<00:01:55.410> do<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> again<00:02:00.200> I'll<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.620> our

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
I just do that again I'll get our
