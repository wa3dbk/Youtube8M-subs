00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.900
 several come on the Let Go changed 2008 in Cologne 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.970
 unbelievable what lego fans are all about 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.150
 with stones build in the exhibition hall 11 round one on 5000 square meters 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.070
 beautiful model scenes and Ortenberg have been the structures we have 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 We do not know theirs yet 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.589
 his 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 still are good 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.689
 the dapd 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.950
 firmly 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.420
 Rebuilding bands rebuilt this is just as much a sex monster 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.890
 but both have been interested for some time 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 and a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.360
 because I came to it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.070
 I think I have no idea because she has no more say 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.290
 not easy to build in the program that was the first project 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.940
 that was the point on the left side 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 he was my son so was rebuilt 13 times 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 the next projects were after the bunker the trees 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 the trees were also around four different versions and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.579
 I've had such a lecture set there at home so well 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.360
 of competitors from this set I have then the Palisaden stones 4 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.050
 and 2 13 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.350
 but then luck as little horrors build tree and questioned and who 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.440
 already own 5 seconds 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 yes, there you start to build this but then Mobers 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 like Marika Blatter and so one thing comes to another 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 during construction cross section 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 with some 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.470
 Seecode so reasonably 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.560
 with four hits of freedom and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.920
 have to say it's way to say that already 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 Floor plans 5 sec 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.719
 and it's not just about palisade stones because those on the corner 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.940
 namely, he can be rounded, namely slightly oblique cash Oman 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.190
 There are no stones 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.350
 we changed the color between Wiggertal and Dover 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.779
 Wheat the ball not bad because between nightmare always brown 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.229
 with old tree 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.369
 like all tamer 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 already in a draw in the second race over the one with the first power 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.909
 Popcorn and so Bodensteiner taken and once four once six once eighth 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.709
 and so was Steadfast it is the new agent should be twice 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.309
 3a stone can 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.889
 Thiago Motta assured the first trees 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.590
 Burnout Percent built so that was rough in front of a tree 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.369
 became so expensive over time he has both the world 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.539
 Work in progress does not say what merchants heat on the globe - there you can go 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.930
 if minimum order will be 50 euros 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.339
 Order stones and stop in drive-in 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.019
 and here in Darfur is near Bari Kita GÃ¼nzburg Legoland 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.269
 Bagapsch first time the palm leaves and 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.119
 Waldemar there had been the hunt once added to stock 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.299
 and that they are always too few 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.099
 also an assassination 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.999
 in Holland made one two three four 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 12 rooms 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.729
 And that is enough for the world because they are at the nothing more 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.749
 yes and about her team build in between so small gags 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.239
 because 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.180
 otherwise boring and they stay in the memory of the children so I have that 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.220
 already five or six times exhibited different regions and 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.449
 it comes where people are 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.469
 that is always overlaps 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.499
 and 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.959
 there was the parliament somewhere and then they moved on like that 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.969
 our resources from Prof 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.199
 Tips cheats 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.689
 the goal 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 Chr 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.349
 This is 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.179
 Neumarkt 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.349
 Red 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 so 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.409
 when he says 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.409
 the eggs are supplemented 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.739
 it'll be about WebOS 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.460
 Jara receives a lot 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.800
 yes, because Lego Castle respectively ended 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.060
 Basics patches in the coat and Webber will probably be three stations 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.930
 even or 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 or 16 on 2 and 3 6 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.759
 Now they are assembled 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.150
 and so for a witness the bunker and was so-called figure the park 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
 Content does not stand with you because of the strange statements 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.789
 around two children so my wife than 20 injured players belly but im 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.220
 Living room Access does not have 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.400
 except for two sentences 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.379
 and then there is the Eiffel Tower and the great Millennium Feike 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.319
 but he had to get out too 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.729
 because out 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.659
 two reasons of Milan slap so big and 2 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.949
 the two small children submit the topic it is not to be understood Euro 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.229
 the plant is park actually 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.080
 in the garage we have our large garage often separated room or 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.330
 he stands as 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
 not on the words of all segments in principle 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.999
 and even from Lego 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.689
 which spread around again 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.569
 then he tells 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.379
 the ac at their concern close 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.900
 and real shuttles orginal 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.360
 Talabani Craft is partly original 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330
 Renault has to be rebuilt because 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
 Dan but also on the 68 on may or not 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.830
 to put her to 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.340
 it goes with the EM episode Publisher does not lose now installed 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.199
 is because she is simple though 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.129
 the skin is a suggestion you can finish everything 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.559
 so that will be the eyebrows and 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.270
 nothing bound from now on 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.550
 Years the first day with a platform 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.430
 percent is the bowl is 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.360
 not original and also the bunker sure general 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.449
 to hold the trees 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.330
 in turn Portals 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.180
 Reason are also a lot is is all so or the people were 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.009
 Squad changed because 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.430
 really satisfied 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.430
 but he was separated 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.930
 It is also like that for example there are new renewals promoting every landete 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:28.029
 again at percent point noted he achieved alone was 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.949
 Martin Neumeyer 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.960
 disagreement here is held by the parents should be displayed 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.650
 Lohmar or letter a is 2 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.309
 it just can not believe it 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.539
 dpa 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.539
 they are Kiel 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.050
 that sits
