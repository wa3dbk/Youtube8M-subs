better<00:01:08.070> picture<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> thought<00:01:10.890> I'd<00:01:11.010> do

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
better picture of it so I thought I'd do

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.080 
better picture of it so I thought I'd do
some<00:01:11.280> close-up<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:13.850> show<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> machine

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
some close-up work and show the machine

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
some close-up work and show the machine
since<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> may<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:16.920> soon<00:01:19.340> now

since it may be going very very soon now
there's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> serial<00:01:20.970> number<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> just
