so my hinge diff rig now incorporates
the<00:00:46.059> semi<00:00:46.870> stiff<00:00:47.199> this<00:00:48.100> is<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.309> boom<00:00:48.520> just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
the semi stiff this is the boom just

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.450 
the semi stiff this is the boom just
because<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.329> bottom<00:00:49.629> has<00:00:50.170> got<00:00:50.440> cleaner<00:00:50.770> not

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
because the bottom has got cleaner not

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.860 
because the bottom has got cleaner not
crystal<00:00:51.910> clear<00:00:51.940> but<00:00:52.359> cleaner

um<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.910> just<00:00:55.090> makes<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.390> mechanics<00:00:55.809> so

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
um which just makes the mechanics so

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.990 
um which just makes the mechanics so
much<00:00:56.140> better<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.649> type<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:56.920> spot<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.850> when

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
much better on that type of spot so when

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.069 
much better on that type of spot so when

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
difference for me is using the semi

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.630

the<00:01:45.700> semi<00:01:45.970> stiff<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:46.979> significantly<00:01:47.979> stiffer

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the semi stiff is significantly stiffer

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.760 
the semi stiff is significantly stiffer

I've<00:01:51.369> used<00:01:51.399> this<00:01:51.849> pretty<00:01:52.360> much<00:01:52.539> since<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.959> came

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
I've used this pretty much since it came

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.260 
I've used this pretty much since it came
out<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.619> used<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:53.979> for<00:01:54.009> me<00:01:54.220> multi<00:01:54.580> rigs<00:01:54.789> for

them spots in sort of march-april time

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.619 
them spots in sort of march-april time
so<00:02:09.280> now<00:02:09.429> they're<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.759> bit<00:02:10.119> cleaner<00:02:10.360> than

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
so now they're a little bit cleaner than

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.180 
so now they're a little bit cleaner than
the<00:02:10.750> wear<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.349> means<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.830> get<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> better

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the wear and it means I can get a better

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.770 
the wear and it means I can get a better
presentation<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.150> means<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.599> use<00:02:13.750> a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
presentation and it means I can use a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
presentation and it means I can use a
boom<00:02:14.080> which<00:02:14.650> pushes<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.310> blade<00:02:15.520> pushes<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
boom which pushes the blade pushes the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.820 
boom which pushes the blade pushes the
hook<00:02:16.300> bait<00:02:16.540> sorry<00:02:16.810> further<00:02:17.260> away<00:02:17.560> from<00:02:17.739> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
hook bait sorry further away from the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.110 
hook bait sorry further away from the
lead<00:02:17.980> system<00:02:18.370> because<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> inherent

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
lead system because of the inherent

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.480 
lead system because of the inherent
stiffness<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.690> material

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
stiffness in the material

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.880 
stiffness in the material
now<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.630> start<00:02:21.750> by<00:02:22.080> tying<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
now what I do is I start by tying up the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
now what I do is I start by tying up the
the<00:02:23.700> hinge<00:02:23.910> section<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.470> be

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the hinge section and I like that to be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
the hinge section and I like that to be
sort<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.220> inch<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> half<00:02:26.610> between<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
sort of an inch and a half between the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.060 
sort of an inch and a half between the
swivel<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> eye<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> hook<00:02:28.860> I

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
swivel and the in the eye of the hook I

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.530 
swivel and the in the eye of the hook I
don't<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.610> too<00:02:29.790> long<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> bate

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
don't like it too long I like the bate

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.150 
don't like it too long I like the bate
nice<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.990> low<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.530> get<00:02:31.650> away<00:02:31.740> with<00:02:32.040> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
nice and low if I can get away with it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430 
nice and low if I can get away with it

me some stunning fish and that's the
malty<00:02:58.890> rig<00:02:59.070> now<00:02:59.760> I've<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.180> been<00:03:00.300> using<00:03:00.540> that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
malty rig now I've not been using that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.000 
malty rig now I've not been using that
as<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.230> late<00:03:01.410> because<00:03:01.770> I've<00:03:01.920> been

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
as much of late because I've been

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.380 
as much of late because I've been
fishing<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> really<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:02.970> low

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
fishing it with a really really low

rig<00:03:05.910> low<00:03:06.060> enough<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.570> what<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> want<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.740> as<00:03:07.800> you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
rig low enough for what I want so as you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.200 
rig low enough for what I want so as you
can<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.490> because<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.910> how<00:03:09.030> that's

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
can see on that because of how that's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.150 
can see on that because of how that's
weighted<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.290> literally<00:03:10.710> an<00:03:10.800> inch<00:03:10.950> off

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160

the bottom when that's in position now
the<00:03:14.000> semi<00:03:15.000> stiff<00:03:15.330> means<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.440> keep<00:03:16.620> an

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the semi stiff means that I can keep an

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.580 
the semi stiff means that I can keep an
