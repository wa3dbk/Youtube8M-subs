00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
 most important characters of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
 physicoconstructivism here in mexico and 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 today comes to give a talk a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 conference here to the auditorium of the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.190
 old school of law of the uat 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.740
 tell us teacher hello good morning 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.220
 thanks for the invitation one more time 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 They invite us to Villahermosa a city 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 where there is a lot much boom a lot push 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.789
 in the physicoconstructivism and the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.039
 Mexican federation of 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.750
 physicoconstructivism and fitness that the 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.100
 presides rightly offered 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 gutierrez 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.870
 has appropriately occupied a space 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.980
 important in training coaches 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 we work in clean money 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 Mexican and what is trying to be 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 to do is to bring those same seminars to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.989
 the whole country 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 on this occasion today we are here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 in villahermosa with that intention of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 train coaches to open the criteria 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.629
 of what's happening in gyms 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 unfortunately there is little information in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.670
 this sport and put it and it's very very 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 deformed young people are currently 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 taking the wrong paths 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 they are intimidated by images by 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.100
 magazines that have no support 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.350
 scientist then our idea of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.110
 this side is to reach all the spaces 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.300
 the country to train people are looking 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
 then to make the instructors 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.990
 the teachers who work in the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.479
 gymnasiums because they support the kids more and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.550
 train them better if it's the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.260
 idea is the idea that the kids in the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.420
 gyms the trainers really 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.090
 have at least one support 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 basic concepts to be able to attend to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.860
 all our population that good a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.720
 another way we are confident to get there 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 to the gym in order to rehabilitate 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.070
 people with health problems people who 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.900
 he just wants to look good and we 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.280
 well at least we should have 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 basic concepts of what is the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 human physiology in this case which 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 would be these basic concepts this that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.850
 people must know of forces to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 of drawer to train so 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.940
 correct there are important issues are 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.429
 basic initials such as the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.649
 descriptive note today we have a few 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.330
 topics here very interesting among others 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 that we're going to give you for example population 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 special 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 pregnant women child population 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 you really should do exercises from 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.069
 child not and because old age 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.160
 hypertensive diabetic obesity we treat 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.440
 a very important issue that is necessary 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.760
 touch it pharmacology today 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.950
 because young people are turning 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.860
 the decisions when that is not the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 way then educates them that is not 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.950
 they are told do not do it they are taught that 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.870
 is that and they do not take the criteria themselves 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 that it's not right to do it because 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 it is not correct for example that a child 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.489
 12 or 13 years old that starts arriving at 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.080
 gym and start taking pills or 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.390
 inject substances to apparently 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.370
 look better is that it is the problem that 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.319
 They think that's going to be better not 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.780
 with what we try to explain 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.180
 in the seminars is that it is an anabolic 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 steroid you have to be careful because 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.140
 the anabolic but is saying to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.040
 clinical purposes not for sporting purposes 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.349
 while the young man is educated that the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.380
 find a healthy and aesthetic physique and 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.690
 nice is through the years it's not 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.400
 with substances as is achieved ie 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.960
 there must be a culture of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.510
 effort and perseverance 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.220
 of physical conditioning is the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.230
 main point educate the people that the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.060
 exercise is not is not recreational is not 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.670
 Fashion is not know who gets better the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.110
 building is a physiological need and 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.900
 that makes people know that that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.700
 it is as such a physiological necessity 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.590
 you have to do it every day as 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.360
 eat and sleep ok 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.910
 finally what would you say to all the people 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.440
 to all young people especially since that 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.030
 currently they are interested in 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.040
 enter something in the gym to get to 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.710
 practice some sport like you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.630

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.550
 I really invite you to take this 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.800
 kind of seminars really is a 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.230
 wonderful time investment where 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880
 they are going to get motivation they are going to give themselves a 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.400
 little bit tells how it is that I should 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.430
 take care of my why and this kind of 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.140
 seminars end up motivating people 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.180
