 of the foundation house old febem 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.760
 of SÃ£o Paulo discovers in maneuvers with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 How can you learn from the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 tumbles get up and move forward one 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 a pioneering project that began with a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 volunteer has already returned more than 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.680
 juvenile offenders 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.210
 the right to dream of a future 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
 different 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 teaching daring sandro makes maneuvers 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.779
 radicals in the lives of these young 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
 offenders who are deprived of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.030
 freedom is with the skate on the feet that the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.629
 teacher makes the best of these 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.390
 boys was 99 an old presentation 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460
 today, the foundation of the house that sandro 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 realized that this board with wheels 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 could be a powerful tool for 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.989
 feel that those boys 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 the look of them that they wanted 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.989
 to participate in the most intensely 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 just stay watching 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.070
 there was the first impulse to speak for 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.719
 one doing something there and they were young 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.640
 similar to my club hold on 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 periphery and the difference between them and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 here I am on skateboard 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.580
 experience shows that he was 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.520
 sure in speed maybe a new 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.229
 way in tango the certainty of a lesson 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 because you can not give up just because it 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.240
 A tumble, nothing because these people give up. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 we will never reach the goal 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.320
 that we have erred learned again is the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.770
 people are dropping what is learned and falling 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 is part of skateboarding and life 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.110
 these kids know that well they have 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 15 and 20 years of age with pain 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.450
 internship at home foundation in sao paulo 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 all convicted of any crime are 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 here to recover 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.939
 sport has given a little stress 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 I teach skateboarding, it encourages me, it 's just me. 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 falling so much , but once in a while 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.060
 when I hit a new one but it's part 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 of life falling and rising is also 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 it is also certainly a pride for the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 teacher who, in addition to passing 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.690
 life can make school subjects 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 more attractive to whom many times 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 there is only sport in that sport. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 night and sometimes comes with a patio 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.140
 school, I explain that you do not forget the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 mathematics aimed at the 45-degree ramp and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.570
 360 that they spoke English here in class 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.820
 the tail of the skate the nose is the backside that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.160
 the physical maneuver that the strong reaction 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.380
 hit skate on the ground so he can jump 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.850
 then climb I try to explain 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.650
 They also in a variant where more 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.540
 that the skateboard is contained in the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 classroom too and that if you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.840
 study you will open a little difficult 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 also in addition to other benefits 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.080
 study brings eight years teacher 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.030
 volunteer for only 40 students today 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.430
 employee of thousands 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.320
 requested and rewarded is that today 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.780
 night he will be honored next to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.300
 personalities as entrepreneur abilio 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 for example the first edition of the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.220
 prize of sports and citizenship of the city hall 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.320
 of sao paulo but there is great reward 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.320
 Sandro is here on the court when he 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.500
 manages to make skate a real 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.920
 tool for transforming lives is a 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.480
 prize is always good, because the trophy 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.550
 not well the serial that will represent 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.650
 all this work that we do more 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.630
 but I think it's more important is tatiana 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.400
 From here on, bring the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.770
 trophy that boys come after it is 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.060
 one thing I did not do alone without 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.730
 their help shot the participation 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.470
 of their commitment and to be able to speak 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.430
 the public is talking about bringing a 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.500
 little more attention to this problem 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.000
 that we have and that is not worth 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.970
 pity to stay at home complaining 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.489
 call the government think that society 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.500
 civil public and private citizens all 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.390
 all have to collaborate in some way 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.590
 doing my part I hope it serves as a 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.810
 example to other people doing this 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.790
 and sandro does not even need to have the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.700
 recognition because here 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.410
 within himself he elapsed applause 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.180
 I think he deserved it and sweet because he 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.530
 has encouraged us always 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.290
 sport and he's a guy who talks or 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.260
 understand 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.930
 Ernande word for the in 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.209
 humility as it is said in sandro slang 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.129
 achievement once boys and turn 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.099
 reference of respect 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.259
 Before leaving, he greets one and 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.410
 leaves a message in the language they 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.240
 understand the most radical maneuver is to fall 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.740
 I raise see where wrong to try again 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.990
 until they got doors they received a 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.389
 sidewalk and a large ramp which is 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 get out of here and start a new life there 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.060
 had been this more radical maneuver than I 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.060
 I have to be late.
