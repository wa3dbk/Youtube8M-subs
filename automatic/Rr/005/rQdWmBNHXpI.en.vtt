00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 youtube friends are riding to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.340
 You now have my slicer. 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.759
 bottles with you can see here I 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.609
 used a little engine of the platoon 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.010
 microwaves right 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.710
 spin the bottle come back playing to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.710
 you see the operation 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.850
 you can see that it spins so 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.350
 which cuts the bottle and in a way 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 better right than when we had seen in the hand 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.270
 sometimes it was not uniform and I used 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:59.460
 also the existence of a stove 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.879
 electric stove I made here an adjustment of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.549
 tall bottles times higher 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 Bottom bottle we can 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.930
 control height nÃ© 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.170
 I still have to finish the work here. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.600
 a crank becomes easier, huh? 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 I 'm waking up now for you to see. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 then a bottle of champagne these 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.100
 3 liter bottles ne 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 A big bottle in blue color is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 bottle has a very thick glass or 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.130
 very thick 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.130
 and just to show the idea to you still 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 will improve somewhat this machine is a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:49.290
 dog she there right? 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:51.380
 at some point and we'll call the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380
 motor 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.740
 the resistance 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.840
 I'm using and resistance 220 right. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.680
 you may notice that heating is 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.680
 pretty fast 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.380
 decrease the height here a bit 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:38.230
 she already started right? 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:40.690
 to break you could come and hold 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:54.550
 here guys that is the end of my 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:58.900
 benches for those who do not fall to the ground well 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:04.080
 fast right should write down and as I said 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.590
 For you it 's a bottle, it's thick. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.700
 and the tip is for you and edit 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.410
 automating the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.100
 bottle of yours 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.100
 I hope that you enjoyed
