completed<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:50.820> looks<00:00:51.270> pretty<00:00:53.239> close<00:00:54.239> right

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
completed which looks pretty close right

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.920 
completed which looks pretty close right
here<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.860> next<00:00:56.250> we'll<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.059> working<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> top

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
here so next we'll be working on the top

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
here so next we'll be working on the top
portion<00:00:58.609> now<00:00:59.609> you're<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> able

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
portion now you're not going to be able
to<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to see this but if you actually have the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
to see this but if you actually have the
case<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.270> look<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> inside<00:01:04.260> portion

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
case if you look at the inside portion

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
case if you look at the inside portion
there's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> small<00:01:05.760> area<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> label

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.300 
there's a small area that has a label
now<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.360> label<00:01:09.360> portion<00:01:10.170> should<00:01:10.470> always<00:01:11.070> be

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now that label portion should always be

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.539 
now that label portion should always be
facing<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.180> keyboard<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.130> above

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
facing the keyboard which is right above

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
facing the keyboard which is right above
this<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.119> touch<00:01:15.299> pad<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.780> also<00:01:18.930> hear

is always facing the bottom if not if

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
is always facing the bottom if not if
you<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.590> rotate<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> upside<00:01:47.549> down<00:01:47.689> for

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you actually rotate it upside down for

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.770 
you actually rotate it upside down for
some<00:01:48.960> odd<00:01:49.200> reason<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> does<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.610> fit<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
