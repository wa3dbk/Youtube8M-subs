off<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.820> hook<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.570> I'm<00:04:04.690> not<00:04:04.870> even<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.140> hockey

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
off the hook and I'm not even a hockey

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.390 
off the hook and I'm not even a hockey
fan<00:04:05.740> but<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.990> who<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.020> gonna<00:04:08.530> be<00:04:08.620> ridiculous<00:04:09.160> but

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
fan but I who is gonna be ridiculous but

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.150 
fan but I who is gonna be ridiculous but
anyway<00:04:09.700> let's<00:04:09.880> get<00:04:09.970> back<00:04:10.030> on<00:04:10.150> basketball<00:04:11.160> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
anyway let's get back on basketball you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.400 
anyway let's get back on basketball you
know<00:04:12.190> why<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.120> wouldn't<00:04:13.480> Madden<00:04:13.960> do<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.260> you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
know why I wouldn't Madden do it you

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.990 
know why I wouldn't Madden do it you
know<00:04:14.560> why<00:04:14.800> are<00:04:14.860> they<00:04:15.070> just<00:04:15.100> doing<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.730> but<00:04:15.910> I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
know why are they just doing it but I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.580 
know why are they just doing it but I
think<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:16.510> what<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:16.959> think<00:04:17.200> this<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
think this is what I think this is the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.099 
think this is what I think this is the
reason<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:19.180> they<00:04:19.359> want<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.660> try<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:19.900> out

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
reason I think they want to try it out

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.449 
reason I think they want to try it out
they<00:04:20.440> want<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> see<00:04:20.829> how<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.220> going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.400> go

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
they want to see how it's going to go

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.540 
they want to see how it's going to go
what<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.360> problems<00:04:22.870> are<00:04:23.110> what<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.650> positives

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
what the problems are what the positives

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.700 
what the problems are what the positives
are<00:04:24.790> they<00:04:25.360> just<00:04:25.570> want<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.840> try<00:04:26.020> these<00:04:26.110> want<00:04:26.590> you

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
are they just want to try these want you

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.070 
are they just want to try these want you
to<00:04:26.770> trial<00:04:27.100> basis<00:04:28.000> they<00:04:28.150> know<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.600> live<00:04:28.840> is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
to trial basis they know that live is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
to trial basis they know that live is
already<00:04:29.440> pretty<00:04:29.620> much<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.919> tarnished<00:04:30.460> image<00:04:30.700> so

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
already pretty much a tarnished image so

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.390 
already pretty much a tarnished image so
it's<00:04:31.330> like<00:04:31.450> why<00:04:31.480> not<00:04:31.690> do<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.320> there<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.950> it

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it's like why not do it to there and it

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.630 
it's like why not do it to there and it
has<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.700> potential<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.210> coming<00:04:35.020> back<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:35.980> but

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
has the potential of coming back so but

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.010 
has the potential of coming back so but
the<00:04:36.760> good<00:04:36.940> thing<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.480> about<00:04:37.510> live

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
the good thing that I like about live

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.180 
the good thing that I like about live
and<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.530> what<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.740> really<00:04:39.010> like<00:04:39.160> about

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
and this is what I really like about

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.030 
and this is what I really like about
live<00:04:39.669> admire<00:04:40.300> about<00:04:40.510> live<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:40.930> EA<00:04:41.260> for<00:04:41.860> this

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
live admire about live and EA for this

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.030
