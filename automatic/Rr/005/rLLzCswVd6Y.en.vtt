interested in this pair of coyotes that

were traveling through here this
particular<00:00:35.700> track<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.770> would

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
particular track here is what we would

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.270 
particular track here is what we would
call<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.780> direct<00:00:39.780> register<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.190> bit

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
call a direct register it's a little bit

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 
call a direct register it's a little bit
sloppy<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:42.000> coyote<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.559> talk<00:00:43.770> about

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
sloppy for coyote but when we talk about

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
sloppy for coyote but when we talk about
a<00:00:44.070> direct<00:00:44.430> register<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.719> mean<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a direct register what we mean is that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.459 
a direct register what we mean is that
the<00:00:47.010> front<00:00:47.460> foot<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> hind<00:00:48.450> foot<00:00:48.750> step<00:00:49.230> in

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the front foot and the hind foot step in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.689 
the front foot and the hind foot step in
almost<00:00:49.800> exactly<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.379> place<00:00:52.699> oftentimes

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
almost exactly the same place oftentimes

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.900 
almost exactly the same place oftentimes
it's<00:00:54.600> impossible<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> even<00:00:55.860> decipher<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's impossible to even decipher the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's impossible to even decipher the
fact<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.600> were<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.960> tracks<00:00:58.350> they're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
fact that there were two tracks they're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130 
fact that there were two tracks they're
so<00:00:59.219> neatly<00:00:59.520> placed<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.570> characteristic

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so neatly placed that's a characteristic

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.939 
so neatly placed that's a characteristic
of<00:01:01.530> coyotes<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.680> bit

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of coyotes here we have a little bit

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.399 
of coyotes here we have a little bit
different<00:01:05.610> thing<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
different thing going on this is what we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
different thing going on this is what we
would<00:01:07.590> call<00:01:07.799> an<00:01:08.040> indirect<00:01:09.000> register<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> an

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
would call an indirect register and an

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
would call an indirect register and an
indirect<00:01:10.650> register<00:01:11.100> means<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.490> instead<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
indirect register means that instead of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
indirect register means that instead of
the<00:01:12.150> hind<00:01:12.450> foot<00:01:12.720> landing<00:01:13.260> where<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.460> front

the hind foot landing where the front
foot<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:16.020> step<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.979> side<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
what we call a direct register trot when

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
what we call a direct register trot when
is<00:01:29.640> doing<00:01:29.939> something<00:01:30.329> else<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:31.170> useful<00:01:31.710> to

know track patterns because we can tell

a little bit about its behavior here

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
a little bit about its behavior here
we've<00:01:36.600> made<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.869> plaster<00:01:37.290> cast<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.490> coyote<00:01:38.909> in

we've made a plaster cast of a coyote in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.679 
we've made a plaster cast of a coyote in

here<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> plaster<00:02:15.000> cast<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:16.110> bobcat

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
here we have a plaster cast of a bobcat

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.310 
here we have a plaster cast of a bobcat
track<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:18.030> tracks<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.690> front<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.970> hind

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
track two tracks the front and the hind

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.980 
track two tracks the front and the hind
this<00:02:22.320> Bobcat<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.640> doing<00:02:24.060> an<00:02:24.180> overstep

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
this Bobcat is also doing an overstep

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.160 
this Bobcat is also doing an overstep
but<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.130> Bobcat<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.080> its

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
but for the Bobcat that is one of its

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.440 
but for the Bobcat that is one of its
most<00:02:28.470> common<00:02:29.100> ways<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.580> moving<00:02:29.790> around<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
most common ways of moving around the

most common ways of moving around the
landscape<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.310> tell<00:02:32.580> by<00:02:32.790> comparing

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
landscape so we can tell by comparing

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840 
landscape so we can tell by comparing
those<00:02:33.540> two<00:02:33.810> patterns<00:02:34.140> they're<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:35.310> the
