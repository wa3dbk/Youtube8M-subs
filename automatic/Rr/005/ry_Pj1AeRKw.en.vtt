circle about two inches in diameter this

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.790 
circle about two inches in diameter this
is<00:00:49.090> gonna<00:00:49.210> be<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.510> base<00:00:49.720> for<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.440> bowl<00:00:50.590> and

is gonna be the base for the bowl and
it's<00:00:50.920> gonna<00:00:51.010> help<00:00:51.190> keep<00:00:51.310> it<00:00:51.670> from<00:00:51.790> tipping

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
you'll be able to dip it straight up and

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.010 
you'll be able to dip it straight up and
down<00:01:00.250> instead<00:01:01.090> of<00:01:01.210> having<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.540> tilt<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.900> from

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
down instead of having to tilt it from

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.420 
down instead of having to tilt it from
side<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.260> side<00:01:02.590> like<00:01:02.620> I'm<00:01:02.890> doing<00:01:03.130> now<00:01:03.250> but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
side to side like I'm doing now but

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.280 
side to side like I'm doing now but
because<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.700> only<00:01:03.880> made<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.449> them<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.809> didn't

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
because I only made two of them I didn't

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.690 
because I only made two of them I didn't
want<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.530> melt<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.830> big<00:01:06.100> container<00:01:06.580> of

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.080 
want to melt a big container of
chocolate<00:01:07.479> so<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:09.070> end<00:01:09.189> result<00:01:09.549> for<00:01:09.610> me<00:01:09.790> was<00:01:10.060> I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
chocolate so the end result for me was I

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.330 
chocolate so the end result for me was I
ended<00:01:10.390> up<00:01:10.479> with<00:01:10.659> an<00:01:10.780> uneven<00:01:11.259> edge<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.100> bowl

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
ended up with an uneven edge to the bowl

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.940

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
out how to solve that problem so dip it

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:18.870 
out how to solve that problem so dip it
in<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> chocolate<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.280> may<00:01:18.369> have<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.579> dip<00:01:18.759> it

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
in the chocolate you may have to dip it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.899 
in the chocolate you may have to dip it
maybe<00:01:19.630> more<00:01:19.899> than<00:01:20.049> once<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.759> make<00:01:21.880> sure

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
maybe more than once just to make sure

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.929 
maybe more than once just to make sure
there's<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.299> nice<00:01:22.479> coat<00:01:23.140> an<00:01:23.340> even<00:01:24.340> coating<00:01:24.729> of

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
just a little bit and then place it on

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.700 
just a little bit and then place it on
that<00:01:30.100> circle<00:01:30.759> that<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:31.060> made<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:32.409> put<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
that circle that you made then put the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.080 
that circle that you made then put the
whole<00:01:32.829> thing<00:01:32.859> in<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.219> refrigerator<00:01:33.759> or<00:01:33.999> the

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
once the chocolate is hardened you need

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.239 
once the chocolate is hardened you need
to<00:01:39.729> remove<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.719> balloon<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.530> do<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:41.829> you

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
to remove the balloon and to do this you

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.340 
to remove the balloon and to do this you
need<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.549> break<00:01:42.819> it<00:01:42.999> so<00:01:43.569> what<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:43.719> did<00:01:43.929> I<00:01:43.960> used<00:01:44.049> a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
need to break it so what I did I used a

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.779 
need to break it so what I did I used a
pair<00:01:44.499> of<00:01:44.560> scissors<00:01:44.740> just<00:01:44.889> to<00:01:45.130> snip<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.460> hole<00:01:45.670> in

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
pair of scissors just to snip a hole in

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:46.950 
pair of scissors just to snip a hole in
the<00:01:45.880> top<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.389> way<00:01:46.569> to<00:01:46.630> have<00:01:46.780> some

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the top and this way to have some

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.709 
the top and this way to have some
control<00:01:47.409> over<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:48.460> fast<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:49.240> air<00:01:49.389> went<00:01:49.659> out

if<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.020> pop<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.590> with<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.920> pin<00:01:51.249> it's

just gently peel the balloon out of the

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
paper and for some reason I ended up

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.639 
paper and for some reason I ended up
with<00:02:07.359> a<00:02:07.389> little<00:02:07.450> hole<00:02:07.779> in<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.110> bottom<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.530> my

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.290 
with a little hole in the bottom of my
bowls<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.310> thinking<00:02:09.700> maybe<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.209> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
bowls like thinking maybe just the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.070 
bowls like thinking maybe just the
weight<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> balloon

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080

pressing<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> chocolate<00:02:12.690> made<00:02:13.690> little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
pressing on the chocolate made little

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020 
pressing on the chocolate made little
hole<00:02:14.020> but<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.709> easily<00:02:14.950> fixed<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.640> put<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
hole but it's easily fixed I put a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.210 
hole but it's easily fixed I put a
little<00:02:16.240> bit<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.480> chocolate<00:02:16.630> on<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.980> little

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
little bit of chocolate on that little

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.290 
little bit of chocolate on that little
hole<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:18.790> put<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.060> back<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
hole and it's put it back in the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.990 
hole and it's put it back in the
refrigerator<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.870> let<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.080> set

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000

that's to keep the heat of my fingers

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.930 
that's to keep the heat of my fingers
from<00:03:10.870> melting<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> chocolate<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:12.640> avoid

leaving fingerprints in the chocolate it

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.410 
leaving fingerprints in the chocolate it
just<00:03:15.010> makes<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.490> prettier<00:03:15.850> Bowl<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:16.270> there

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
just makes for a prettier Bowl if there

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.760

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.410 
just pressed the edge of the bowl until
it<00:03:30.550> started<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.269> melt<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:33.340> there<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.239> go

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.020 
it started to melt and in there you go
look<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:36.100> made<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.400> nice<00:03:36.760> and
