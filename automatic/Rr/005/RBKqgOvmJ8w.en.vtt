00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
I also thinking maybe we could change

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.880 
I also thinking maybe we could change
Goodis<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.880> greatest<00:03:24.360> or<00:03:24.570> best<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.350> something

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
Goodis to greatest or best or something

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.610 
Goodis to greatest or best or something
