what<00:02:23.430> finishes<00:02:23.970> its<00:02:24.799> luster<00:02:25.799> then<00:02:26.489> got<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
what finishes its luster then got and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.030 
what finishes its luster then got and
they<00:02:27.840> stopped<00:02:28.079> selling<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:28.860> good

they stopped selling it and I was good

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
they stopped selling it and I was good
so<00:02:29.310> I've<00:02:29.400> been<00:02:29.519> trying<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.849> find<00:02:30.030> dupes<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
so I've been trying to find dupes and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
so I've been trying to find dupes and
that's<00:02:31.530> probably<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.250> best<00:02:32.400> one<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.940> be

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that's probably the best one to be

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.280 
that's probably the best one to be
honest<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:35.489> looks<00:02:36.000> quite<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.629> on<00:02:36.989> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
honest and it looks quite like on but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.949 
honest and it looks quite like on but
not<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:37.680> much<00:02:37.950> saught<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.180> if

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
not very much saught right now and if

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.140 
not very much saught right now and if
anyone<00:02:40.349> somehow<00:02:40.920> finds<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.640> way<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.970> getting

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
anyone somehow finds a way of getting

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
anyone somehow finds a way of getting
that<00:02:42.870> might<00:02:43.200> lady<00:02:43.470> gaga<00:02:43.829> lipstick<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:44.519> you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
all over but yeah I don't think the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.180 
all over but yeah I don't think the
smell<00:04:20.880> would<00:04:21.030> attract<00:04:21.359> anyone<00:04:21.719> to<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.930> on

smell would attract anyone to be on

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.530 
smell would attract anyone to be on
and<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:24.200> next<00:04:24.530> one<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.220> one's<00:04:25.490> my<00:04:26.180> new

and the next one this one's my new
favorite<00:04:27.050> I'd<00:04:27.410> probably<00:04:27.590> prefer<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.400> Lady

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
pink when I do that but on it looks

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150

the one on the top but next to the lip
glosses<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:45.650> just<00:04:45.890> awesome<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
glosses and it's just awesome it's a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.130 
glosses and it's just awesome it's a
satin<00:04:46.940> finish<00:04:46.970> which<00:04:47.450> is<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.720> best<00:04:47.900> because

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
satin finish which is the best because

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.340 
satin finish which is the best because
it's<00:04:48.680> still<00:04:49.400> quite<00:04:49.700> smooth<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:50.990> it's<00:04:51.170> not

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
it's still quite smooth but it's not

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.900 
it's still quite smooth but it's not
like<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.650> amplified<00:04:52.070> finish<00:04:52.430> worries<00:04:52.730> like

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
like the amplified finish worries like

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.520 
like the amplified finish worries like
pen<00:04:53.210> in<00:04:53.420> on<00:04:53.540> your<00:04:53.690> lips<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.050> really<00:04:54.320> don't<00:04:54.470> like

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
pen in on your lips I really don't like

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.250 
pen in on your lips I really don't like
that<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.330> yeah<00:04:56.510> i<00:04:56.540> definitely<00:04:56.900> recommend

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
that and so yeah i definitely recommend

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.450 
that and so yeah i definitely recommend
that<00:04:58.120> more<00:04:59.120> than<00:05:00.190> sent<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.370> moon<00:05:01.550> and

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
that more than sent you moon and

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.800 
that more than sent you moon and
probably<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.850> rest<00:05:05.000> of<00:05:05.180> them<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.450> be<00:05:05.570> honest

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
probably the rest of them to be honest

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.220 
probably the rest of them to be honest
and<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.850> another<00:05:08.390> limited<00:05:08.810> edition

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
and this is another limited edition

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.050 
and this is another limited edition
which<00:05:09.980> sucks<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:11.500> max<00:05:12.500> wonder<00:05:13.190> woman<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.670> I

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
which sucks but max wonder woman and I

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.630 
which sucks but max wonder woman and I
think<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.360> just<00:05:14.420> what<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.780> one<00:05:14.930> actually

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
think it's just what the one actually

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.840 
think it's just what the one actually
it's<00:05:16.640> a<00:05:16.820> matte<00:05:17.060> color<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.980> it's<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.190> quite

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
it's a matte color and it's the quite

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.210 
it's a matte color and it's the quite
dark<00:05:20.090> red<00:05:20.420> but<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.020> think<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:21.440> pretty<00:05:21.950> much

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
dark red but I think it's pretty much

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.880 
dark red but I think it's pretty much
everyone<00:05:22.730> especially<00:05:23.450> if<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.900> know<00:05:24.200> use<00:05:24.740> it
