00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
that it was on this map because you know

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.160 
that it was on this map because you know
you<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> move<00:00:27.390> midway<00:00:27.779> through<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you have to move midway through and you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
you have to move midway through and you
have<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> adjust<00:00:29.340> through<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> rounds<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.810> he

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
have to adjust through the rounds and he

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
have to adjust through the rounds and he
played<00:00:31.199> domination<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.129> he<00:00:32.279> had<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.580> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
played domination so he had to do it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.240 
played domination so he had to do it
twice<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.210> game<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.769> definitely<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
twice in the game and it's definitely a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
twice in the game and it's definitely a
learning<00:00:35.430> curve<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.730> me<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.970> still<00:00:36.330> have<00:00:36.510> not

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
learning curve for me I still have not

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
learning curve for me I still have not
managed<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.350> any<00:00:37.590> good<00:00:37.830> games<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.580> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
managed to get any good games here on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450 
managed to get any good games here on
this<00:00:39.420> map<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.930> recovery<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.770> black<00:00:41.070> sharp<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
