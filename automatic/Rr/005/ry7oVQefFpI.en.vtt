anything<00:00:19.260> else<00:00:19.670> very<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:21.000> hard<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.480> believe

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
anything else very very hard to believe

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.620 
anything else very very hard to believe
if<00:00:22.050> any<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.859> true<00:00:23.029> but<00:00:24.029> again<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
if any of this is true but again this is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
if any of this is true but again this is
all<00:00:24.840> based<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.289> mythology<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.269> cases

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
all based on mythology and in some cases

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.620 
all based on mythology and in some cases
mythology<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> based<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.949> fact<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
mythology is based on fact so I'm just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
seemed really interesting to read about

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.160 
seemed really interesting to read about
this<00:00:34.070> particular<00:00:35.070> monster<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.170> hopefully

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this particular monster and hopefully

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.840 
this particular monster and hopefully
everyone<00:00:37.440> else<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.010> finds<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> decision

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
everyone else you know finds a decision

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.020 
everyone else you know finds a decision
for<00:00:38.940> anything<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.420> did<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.940> monster<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
for anything as I did now the monster in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.560 
for anything as I did now the monster in
question<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.870> being<00:00:43.739> known<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.250> Shirou<00:00:44.910> fate<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
question is being known as Shirou fate I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
question is being known as Shirou fate I
believe<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.350> how<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.829> being<00:00:47.190> set

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
believe that's how it's being set

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
believe that's how it's being set
correctly<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.329> roofing<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.160> essentially

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
correctly to roofing and essentially

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.119 
correctly to roofing and essentially
it's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:51.090> creature<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.289> mythological

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's a again creature of mythological

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.959 
it's a again creature of mythological
and<00:00:53.699> folklore<00:00:53.940> aspects<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.930> apparently

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
and folklore aspects it's apparently

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
and folklore aspects it's apparently
something<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> lives<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.809> Chilean

the area again this is all pretty loose

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.289 
the area again this is all pretty loose
when<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> comes<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.070> believability<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
when it comes to the believability of

when it comes to the believability of
such<00:01:36.509> things<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> day<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.520> in

such things but to this day still in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.080 
such things but to this day still in
Chile<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> around<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.650> areas<00:01:41.070> people<00:01:41.970> will

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
Chile and around those areas people will

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.440 
Chile and around those areas people will
leave<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:43.409> some<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:43.829> things<00:01:44.450> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
leave in some of these things and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
leave in some of these things and
essentially<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> mythological<00:01:47.450> aspect<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
essentially the mythological aspect of

essentially the mythological aspect of
this<00:01:48.720> creature<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.799> causes<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
this creature is that it causes the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.960 
this creature is that it causes the
volcanic<00:01:51.240> eruptions<00:01:52.430> what<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> what's<00:01:53.790> said

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
volcanic eruptions what of what's said

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.600 
volcanic eruptions what of what's said
to<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.299> abated<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:55.140> keep<00:01:55.890> them<00:01:56.130> monster

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
to have abated or keep them monster

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.749 
to have abated or keep them monster
being<00:01:57.149> appeased<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> fact<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.759> if

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
being appeased is the fact that if

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.510 
being appeased is the fact that if
somebody<00:02:00.090> would<00:02:00.270> sacrifice<00:02:01.040> any<00:02:02.040> victims

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
somebody would sacrifice any victims

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.969 
somebody would sacrifice any victims
into<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.270> volcano<00:02:03.719> itself<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.740> would

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
into the volcano itself and would

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.850 
into the volcano itself and would
consume<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.869> shoot<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
consume it and then shoot out this and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.780 
consume it and then shoot out this and
body<00:02:08.039> parts<00:02:08.509> lit<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.629> fire<00:02:09.770> which<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.160> guess

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
body parts lit on fire which I guess

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.199 
body parts lit on fire which I guess
older<00:02:12.330> Chileans

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
older Chileans

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.899 
older Chileans

it's<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.650> know<00:03:09.159> it<00:03:09.310> sounds<00:03:09.549> far-fetched<00:03:09.700> but

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
it's I know it sounds far-fetched but

it's I know it sounds far-fetched but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
when one thinks about it again certain

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.970 
when one thinks about it again certain
areas<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.359> earth<00:03:13.540> especially<00:03:14.349> if<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.829> go

to the bottom of the ocean there are

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.059 
to the bottom of the ocean there are

that's<00:03:21.430> several<00:03:22.109> hundreds<00:03:23.109> if<00:03:23.199> not<00:03:23.229> thousands

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that flourish in that area they swim

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.509 
that flourish in that area they swim
around<00:03:28.689> they<00:03:29.139> feed<00:03:29.409> on<00:03:29.439> the<00:03:29.650> area<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:30.280> like

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
around they feed on the area it's like

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.559 
around they feed on the area it's like
nothing<00:03:31.449> to<00:03:31.569> them<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> idea<00:03:32.979> of

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
nothing to them and so the idea of

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.699 
nothing to them and so the idea of
creatures<00:03:34.569> being<00:03:34.930> able<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.169> live<00:03:35.409> inside

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
volcanoes again doesn't have to be too

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.839 
volcanoes again doesn't have to be too
far-fetched<00:03:38.319> if<00:03:38.799> we<00:03:38.949> already<00:03:39.069> have<00:03:39.400> creatures

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
far-fetched if we already have creatures

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.530 
far-fetched if we already have creatures
that<00:03:40.810> live<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.109> areas<00:03:41.349> where<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.359> of

ously<00:03:45.909> and<00:03:46.150> yet<00:03:46.299> these<00:03:46.389> creatures<00:03:46.629> flourish

inside<00:04:07.540> lava<00:04:08.199> itself<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.949> see<00:04:09.099> what's

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
inside lava itself and see what's

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.920 
inside lava itself and see what's
happening<00:04:09.609> again<00:04:10.359> it's<00:04:10.509> hard<00:04:10.659> to<00:04:10.750> document

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
happening again it's hard to document

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.439 
happening again it's hard to document
that<00:04:11.379> something<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:12.009> could<00:04:12.280> exist

that something like this could exist

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.330 
that something like this could exist

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
without that proof and that's why it's

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.539 
without that proof and that's why it's
considered<00:04:15.790> more<00:04:15.819> of<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.239> legend<00:04:16.659> of<00:04:16.959> some<00:04:17.139> sort

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
considered more of a legend of some sort

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.069 
considered more of a legend of some sort
but<00:04:18.549> it'd<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.150> interesting<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.599> think<00:04:19.930> that

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
but it'd be interesting to think that

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.539 
but it'd be interesting to think that
yeah<00:04:20.289> there's<00:04:20.650> creatures<00:04:21.009> out<00:04:21.219> there<00:04:21.250> that

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
yeah there's creatures out there that

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.969 
yeah there's creatures out there that
live<00:04:21.909> in<00:04:22.210> volcanoes<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.200> are<00:04:23.650> able<00:04:23.860> to

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
live in volcanoes and are able to

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.490 
live in volcanoes and are able to
flourish<00:04:24.219> and<00:04:24.760> again<00:04:25.599> not<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.960> far<00:04:26.139> fit

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
flourish and again not that far fit

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.400 
flourish and again not that far fit
when<00:04:26.650> one<00:04:26.830> thinks<00:04:27.010> about<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.930> any<00:04:29.140> case

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
when one thinks about it so in any case

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.400
