00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
onto it and really put the test to this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
onto it and really put the test to this
eight<00:01:16.710> scale<00:01:17.159> truggy<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> thing<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.939> just

eight scale truggy this thing is just
it's<00:01:18.570> huge<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> needs<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.040> stretch<00:01:20.400> its

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it's huge and it needs to stretch its

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
it's huge and it needs to stretch its
legs<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.180> hopefully<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:21.990> Tekin<00:01:22.439> system

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
legs so hopefully with that Tekin system

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
legs so hopefully with that Tekin system
i<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.250> definitely<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.759> now<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.420> may<00:01:24.630> ask

some of this the decals and everything

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.240 
some of this the decals and everything
else<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.930> used<00:01:54.930> some<00:01:55.170> Duratrax<00:01:55.890> paint

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
else here so I used some Duratrax paint

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.569 
else here so I used some Duratrax paint
just<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.689> stuff<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.229> great<00:01:58.469> larger<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just the stuff is great larger can and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.200 
just the stuff is great larger can and
it<00:02:00.270> goes<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:01.020> easily<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.210> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it goes on really easily and it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.370 
it goes on really easily and it's
probably<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> best<00:02:03.960> paints<00:02:04.290> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
probably one of the best paints that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620

I've used to date so really happy with
this<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.619> basically<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.489> they're

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
this I use basically just they're

changed<00:03:59.920> from<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.190> second<00:04:00.550> update<00:04:00.850> but<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.720> did

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
changed from the second update but I did

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.110 
changed from the second update but I did
go<00:04:02.080> ahead<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.350> put<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.310> servo<00:04:03.610> horn<00:04:03.700> from

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
go ahead and put on the servo horn from

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.450 
go ahead and put on the servo horn from
off<00:04:04.390> nough<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.930> got<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.590> thing<00:04:05.770> put<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.100> pretty

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
off nough I got that thing put on pretty

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.610 
off nough I got that thing put on pretty
easily<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.330> low<00:04:07.510> profile<00:04:07.960> one<00:04:08.170> just

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
easily that's the low profile one just

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.940 
easily that's the low profile one just
need<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.830> hook<00:04:08.890> about<00:04:09.190> last<00:04:09.460> little<00:04:09.670> servo<00:04:10.540> arm

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
need to hook about last little servo arm

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
doing some research found out that you

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.219 
doing some research found out that you
know<00:04:23.410> running<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.040> 2000<00:04:24.729> kV<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.419> went<00:04:25.930> up<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.050> a

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229

here<00:04:27.530> for<00:04:28.340> my<00:04:28.520> pinion<00:04:28.909> gear<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.810> did<00:04:30.050> try

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
here for my pinion gear now I did try

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.459 
here for my pinion gear now I did try
out<00:04:30.560> those<00:04:30.949> techno<00:04:31.789> long<00:04:32.150> shaft<00:04:32.509> ones<00:04:32.810> but<00:04:33.379> it

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
out those techno long shaft ones but it

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.140 
out those techno long shaft ones but it
does<00:04:33.680> get<00:04:33.949> in<00:04:34.039> way<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.490> motor<00:04:34.669> mounts<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.120> I

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
does get in way of the motor mounts so I

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.540 
does get in way of the motor mounts so I
was<00:04:35.389> not<00:04:35.599> able<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.990> use<00:04:36.110> those<00:04:36.439> so<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.949> have<00:04:37.430> an

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
was not able to use those so I have an

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.580 
was not able to use those so I have an
extra<00:04:37.819> one<00:04:37.849> now<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.389> maybe<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.319> another

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
extra one now but maybe on another

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.219 
extra one now but maybe on another
project<00:04:39.939> as<00:04:40.939> far<00:04:41.180> as<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.419> spring<00:04:41.750> rates<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.169> do

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
project as far as the spring rates I do

happened with that but I'm on full

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.260 
happened with that but I'm on full
compression<00:04:56.629> or<00:04:56.780> full<00:04:57.639> adjustment<00:04:58.639> here<00:04:59.090> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
compression or full adjustment here and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.909 
compression or full adjustment here and
it's<00:04:59.569> still<00:04:59.750> sitting<00:04:59.960> pretty<00:05:00.349> low<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
it's still sitting pretty low in the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.129 
it's still sitting pretty low in the
rear<00:05:01.099> a<00:05:01.400> little<00:05:01.759> bit<00:05:01.849> lower<00:05:02.060> than<00:05:02.150> I'd<00:05:02.389> want<00:05:03.020> it

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
rear a little bit lower than I'd want it

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.839 
rear a little bit lower than I'd want it
to<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.860> want<00:05:04.129> to<00:05:04.159> be<00:05:04.279> able<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.430> raise<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.789> up

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
to so I want to be able to raise that up

just a little bit and hopefully they

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.850 
just a little bit and hopefully they
have<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.550> correct<00:05:07.819> springs<00:05:08.270> for<00:05:08.539> me<00:05:08.659> so<00:05:08.930> but

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860
