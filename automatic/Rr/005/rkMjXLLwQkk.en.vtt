that's<00:00:56.219> getting<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> mic<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> should

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that's getting into the mic that should

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's getting into the mic that should
be<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.920> we've<00:00:58.920> integrated<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.760> powerful

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
be so we've integrated a really powerful

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.490 
be so we've integrated a really powerful
processing<00:01:00.629> chip<00:01:00.809> inside<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.320> it's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
processing chip inside of here it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
processing chip inside of here it's
going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> work<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.980> an<00:01:02.100> intelligent<00:01:02.370> sensor

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to work like an intelligent sensor

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670 
going to work like an intelligent sensor
so<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> move<00:01:03.870> around<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> microphone

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so as you move around the microphone

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.899 
so as you move around the microphone
it's<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> auto<00:01:05.339> locate<00:01:05.790> your

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it's going to kind of auto locate your

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
it's going to kind of auto locate your
voices<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> eliminate<00:01:07.260> any<00:01:07.470> other<00:01:07.650> noise

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
voices and eliminate any other noise

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
voices and eliminate any other noise
that's<00:01:08.130> getting<00:01:08.340> anything<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> if

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's getting anything like so and if

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
that's getting anything like so and if
you<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> regular<00:01:11.030> nice

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you want to use it like a regular nice

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
you want to use it like a regular nice
blue<00:01:12.330> USB<00:01:12.570> mic<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.619> gonna<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> button

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
blue USB mic there's gonna be a button
