tortillas<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> surprised

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
tortillas which I'm kind of surprised

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.539

because<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.869> brown<00:01:13.799> rice<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
because they have brown rice so you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
because they have brown rice so you
think<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.420> flour

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
think they would have like flour

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.730 
think they would have like flour
tortilla<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.320> well

somehow so I got the brown rice and as
far<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:48.990> beans<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.500> between<00:01:50.100> black<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.340> pinto

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
far as beans go between black and pinto

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550 
far as beans go between black and pinto
beans<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.630> numbers<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.110> pretty<00:01:52.259> much<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
beans the numbers are pretty much the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
beans the numbers are pretty much the
same<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.149> trust

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
same which I don't know if I can trust

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
same which I don't know if I can trust
that<00:01:54.570> let's<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.229> ahead<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.439> pause<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.740> right

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that let's go ahead and pause it right

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.179 
that let's go ahead and pause it right
here

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
here

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
here
they're<00:01:56.759> pinto<00:01:57.119> beans<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.450> made<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.780> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
they're pinto beans are made with like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.440 
they're pinto beans are made with like
bacon<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.369> think<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.909> boost

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
bacon so I would think that would boost

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
bacon so I would think that would boost
up<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> fat<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.770> according<00:02:01.979> their<00:02:02.159> website

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
up the fat but according their website

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.800 
up the fat but according their website
they<00:02:02.759> had<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.360> much<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.630> same

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
they had like pretty much the same

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
they had like pretty much the same
numbers<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> don't<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.850> trust

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
numbers but I don't know if I can trust

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.869 
numbers but I don't know if I can trust
that<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.450> said<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.860> top<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> other<00:02:08.550> things

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that like I said on top of other things

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.960 
that like I said on top of other things
the<00:02:09.450> black<00:02:10.050> beans<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.709> almost<00:02:11.160> 100<00:02:11.610> grams

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the black beans have almost 100 grams

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910 
the black beans have almost 100 grams
less<00:02:12.569> sodium<00:02:13.260> milligram

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
less sodium milligram

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.350 
less sodium milligram
and<00:02:15.140> mm<00:02:16.140> should<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.500> about<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.640> daily<00:02:18.330> intake

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and mm should be about the daily intake

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.680 
and mm should be about the daily intake
of<00:02:18.959> sodium<00:02:19.260> per<00:02:19.680> day<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:21.000> go<00:02:21.239> ahead<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.540> get

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
of sodium per day so go ahead and get

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.430 
of sodium per day so go ahead and get
the<00:02:21.810> black<00:02:22.020> beans<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.720> far<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.200> meats

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440

barbacoa and all four of their meats

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.360 
barbacoa and all four of their meats
carnitas<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> fourth<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:32.220> all

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
carnitas is the fourth one they all

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.710 
carnitas is the fourth one they all
pretty<00:02:32.580> much<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.000> same<00:02:33.090> number<00:02:33.569> on

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
pretty much have the same number on

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
pretty much have the same number on
their<00:02:33.840> website<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.260> well<00:02:34.500> which<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.370> don't<00:02:35.520> know

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
their website as well which I don't know

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.840 
their website as well which I don't know
how<00:02:35.970> much<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.270> trust<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.660> either<00:02:37.080> because

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
how much I can trust that either because

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.000 
how much I can trust that either because
carnitas<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.239> pig<00:02:39.930> meat<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.350> mean<00:02:40.830> you'd

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
carnitas it's pig meat I mean you'd

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.350 
carnitas it's pig meat I mean you'd
think<00:02:41.040> it'd<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.519> lot<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:41.730> fatty

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
think it'd be a lot more fatty

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.380 
think it'd be a lot more fatty
so<00:02:43.080> I'd<00:02:43.260> say<00:02:43.500> stick<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.040> chicken<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:44.489> steak

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
so I'd say stick with chicken or steak

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
so I'd say stick with chicken or steak
the<00:02:45.959> chickens<00:02:46.350> pretty<00:02:46.500> much<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.920> same

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the chickens pretty much the same

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.910 
the chickens pretty much the same
because<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:48.630> dark<00:02:48.959> meat<00:02:49.170> chicken<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because it's dark meat chicken just to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.860 
because it's dark meat chicken just to
give<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.069> more<00:02:50.280> flavor<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.330> either<00:02:51.450> get

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
give it more flavor so either get

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
give it more flavor so either get
chicken<00:02:52.260> steak<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.590> barbacoa<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:53.340> know

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
chicken steak or barbacoa I don't know

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220
