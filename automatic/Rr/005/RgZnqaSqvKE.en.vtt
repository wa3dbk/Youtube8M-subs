it's an 1140 cassette with smooth gear
steps<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.680> important<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> keep<00:00:56.730> your

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
steps it's really important to keep your

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
steps it's really important to keep your
cadence<00:00:57.239> under<00:00:57.719> control<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.680> why<00:00:58.859> we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
cadence under control that's why we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
cadence under control that's why we
choose<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.940> smooth<00:01:00.300> gear<00:01:00.600> steps<00:01:00.899> which

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
choose to have smooth gear steps which

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640 
choose to have smooth gear steps which
are<00:01:01.649> always<00:01:02.190> below<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.940> change<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.719> 15%

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
are always below a change of 15%

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
are always below a change of 15%
this<00:01:05.189> keeps<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.729> having<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.049> cadence

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
this keeps you having the right cadence

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
this keeps you having the right cadence
at<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.950> time<00:01:08.189> even<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:09.000> you're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
at the right time even when you're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
at the right time even when you're
shifting<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.770> move<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
shifting so then when you move from the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.240 
shifting so then when you move from the
cassette<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> front<00:01:12.810> options<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
cassette to the front options there we

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
cassette to the front options there we
come<00:01:14.490> immediately<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> rider<00:01:16.020> tuned

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
come immediately into the rider tuned

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
come immediately into the rider tuned
concept<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.299> two

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
concept because there we have two

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.200 
concept because there we have two
different<00:01:19.080> crank<00:01:19.860> arms<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.939> for

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
different crank arms one for

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
different crank arms one for
cross-country<00:01:21.570> racing<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> narrow<00:01:23.220> Q

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
cross-country racing with a narrow Q

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.050 
cross-country racing with a narrow Q
factor<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:24.090> 158<00:01:24.930> millimeter<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.490> trail

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
factor of 158 millimeter one for trail

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.109 
factor of 158 millimeter one for trail
riding<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> Q<00:01:28.080> factor<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.520> 168<00:01:29.520> millimeter

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
riding with a Q factor of 168 millimeter

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.620 
riding with a Q factor of 168 millimeter
then<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> modular<00:01:32.520> concept<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
then we have a modular concept for the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.460 
then we have a modular concept for the
crank<00:01:33.900> where<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.890> choose<00:01:35.220> 1<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.360> 2<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.170> or

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
crank where you can choose 1 by 2 by or

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.510 
crank where you can choose 1 by 2 by or
3<00:01:38.100> by<00:01:38.250> combination<00:01:38.729> based<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.320> PCD<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
3 by combination based on one PCD so you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
3 by combination based on one PCD so you
can<00:01:41.790> exchange<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.570> chainrings

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can exchange the chainrings

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
can exchange the chainrings
and<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> different<00:01:44.670> crank<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.119> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and make it a different crank set this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
and make it a different crank set this
allows<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.220> proper<00:01:47.460> setup<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
allows you to make the proper setup for

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.929 
allows you to make the proper setup for
your<00:01:48.540> riding<00:01:48.869> sound<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.250> what

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
developed in the new shadow plus Rd then

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.100 
developed in the new shadow plus Rd then
what<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.310> also<00:03:06.580> new<00:03:06.820> on<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> shadow<00:03:07.360> plus<00:03:07.690> Rd

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
what is also new on the shadow plus Rd

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.410 
what is also new on the shadow plus Rd
is<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.740> you're<00:03:09.100> able<00:03:09.490> to<00:03:09.520> adjust<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
is that you're able to adjust the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.480 
is that you're able to adjust the
tension<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.050> Rd<00:03:11.470> from<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.860> outside<00:03:12.250> in

tension of the Rd from the outside in

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.240 
tension of the Rd from the outside in
the<00:03:12.940> past<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.330> had<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.510> take<00:03:13.780> off<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.260> cap<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the past you had to take off the cap to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.100 
the past you had to take off the cap to
reduce<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.880> tension<00:03:16.270> or<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.570> increase<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
reduce the tension or to increase the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
reduce the tension or to increase the
tension<00:03:17.290> now<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.710> can<00:03:17.950> do<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.250> with<00:03:18.400> allen<00:03:18.700> key

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
tension now you can do it with allen key

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.790 
tension now you can do it with allen key
from<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.240> outside<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:20.140> gives<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> more

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
from the outside this gives you more

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.170 
from the outside this gives you more
Ryder<00:03:21.160> tuned<00:03:21.490> options<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.150> can

fine-tune your components to your riding
style<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.600> important<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.400> concept

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
style this is important with the concept

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.980 
style this is important with the concept
of<00:03:27.940> xgr<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.640> most<00:03:30.880> impressive<00:03:31.450> thing<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
of xgr then the most impressive thing of

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.710 
of xgr then the most impressive thing of
the<00:03:32.380> new<00:03:32.530> HDR<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.310> maybe<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.150> front<00:03:34.420> area

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the new HDR is maybe the front area

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.420 
the new HDR is maybe the front area
because<00:03:35.290> we<00:03:35.440> changed<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> whole<00:03:36.040> mechanism

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
because we changed the whole mechanism

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.910 
because we changed the whole mechanism
to<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> side<00:03:37.360> swing<00:03:37.660> mechanism<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.740> can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
to a side swing mechanism and you can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.570 
to a side swing mechanism and you can
see<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.850> wire<00:03:40.090> or<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.050> cable<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.590> coming<00:03:42.100> from

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
see the wire or the cable is coming from

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.890 
see the wire or the cable is coming from
the<00:03:43.030> front<00:03:43.240> side<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.590> FD<00:03:44.980> will<00:03:45.430> move<00:03:45.900> this

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the front side and the FD will move this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.800 
the front side and the FD will move this
way<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.530> will<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> super<00:03:48.730> direct<00:03:49.390> action

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
way and will have a super direct action

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.050 
way and will have a super direct action
super<00:03:50.350> light<00:03:50.620> shifting<00:03:51.070> performance<00:03:51.610> it

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
super light shifting performance it

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.540 
super light shifting performance it
almost<00:03:52.630> feels<00:03:52.990> like<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.290> rear<00:03:53.560> shift<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.160> this

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
almost feels like a rear shift and this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.880 
almost feels like a rear shift and this
is<00:03:54.730> really<00:03:55.060> beneficial<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:55.900> our<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.709> buy

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
is really beneficial for our to buy

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.800 
is really beneficial for our to buy
system<00:03:57.310> because<00:03:57.730> there<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.480> have<00:03:58.510> the

talk about the smoothness of the change

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.520 
talk about the smoothness of the change
we<00:04:10.030> improve<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.570> smoothness<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.290> chain

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
we improve the smoothness of the chain

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.980 
we improve the smoothness of the chain
by<00:04:11.560> using<00:04:12.040> sill<00:04:12.520> tack<00:04:12.760> treatment<00:04:13.270> on<00:04:13.450> the
