00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
adjustments to our programming as

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.200 
adjustments to our programming as
necessary<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:31.110> continue<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.920> progress

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
necessary and I continue to see progress

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.469 
necessary and I continue to see progress
that<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:34.500> should<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.670> too<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> an

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that that should not be too much of an

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
that that should not be too much of an
issue<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.500> capable<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.189> adding<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
issue I think I'm capable of adding a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
issue I think I'm capable of adding a
hundred<00:01:38.820> pounds<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.270> total<00:01:39.630> within<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
hundred pounds on my total within the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
hundred pounds on my total within the
next<00:01:40.470> ten<00:01:40.770> months<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.720> my<00:01:42.720> only<00:01:42.899> real

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
next ten months or so my only real

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
next ten months or so my only real
concern<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.340> fact<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.729> i<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
concern is the fact that i will be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
concern is the fact that i will be
starting<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.720> clinical<00:01:46.140> years<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.560> medical

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
starting my clinical years of medical

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.670 
starting my clinical years of medical
school<00:01:47.030> starting<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.149> june<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
school starting in june and with that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.770 
school starting in june and with that
means<00:01:50.040> basically<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.970> schedule<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
means basically that my schedule will be

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.719 
means basically that my schedule will be
much<00:01:52.020> less<00:01:52.229> flexible<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.009> there<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.700> be

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
much less flexible and there will be

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
much less flexible and there will be
times<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.659> instance<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> surgical

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
times for instance on a surgical

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.679 
times for instance on a surgical
rotation<00:01:56.219> where<00:01:56.460> I'll<00:01:56.700> basically<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.329> getting

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
rotation where I'll basically be getting

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.740 
rotation where I'll basically be getting
up<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.930> four<00:01:58.740> thirty<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> morning<00:01:59.189> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
lifts for the conventional deadlift I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.370 
lifts for the conventional deadlift I
really<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:57.600> an<00:03:57.720> excellent<00:03:58.020> lift

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
really think that it's an excellent lift

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.280 
really think that it's an excellent lift
because<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.800> really<00:03:58.920> forces<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.430> to<00:04:00.110> work<00:04:01.110> on

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
because it really forces you to work on

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.110 
because it really forces you to work on
bracing<00:04:01.800> your<00:04:01.920> core<00:04:02.250> especially<00:04:02.820> because

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
bracing your core especially because

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.180 
bracing your core especially because
your<00:04:03.270> honor<00:04:03.420> tension<00:04:03.990> I'm<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.070> position

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
your honor tension I'm in a position

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.510 
your honor tension I'm in a position
where<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.670> normally<00:04:05.850> would<00:04:06.300> be<00:04:06.480> essentially

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
where you normally would be essentially

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.830 
where you normally would be essentially
dynamically<00:04:08.520> changing<00:04:09.270> position<00:04:09.950> in<00:04:10.950> this

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
dynamically changing position in this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.240 
dynamically changing position in this
deadlift<00:04:12.840> I'm<00:04:12.959> really<00:04:13.170> focusing<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.890> keeping

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
deadlift I'm really focusing on keeping

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.780 
deadlift I'm really focusing on keeping
my<00:04:14.430> hips<00:04:14.850> both<00:04:15.690> high<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.350> back<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.459> reason

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
my hips both high and back the reason

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.580 
my hips both high and back the reason
for<00:04:17.970> keeping<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.390> hips<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.169> basically

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
for keeping the hips back is basically

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.380 
for keeping the hips back is basically
because<00:04:19.980> if<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.489> end<00:04:20.640> up<00:04:20.730> bringing<00:04:20.970> your<00:04:21.269> hips

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
because if you end up bringing your hips

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.380 
because if you end up bringing your hips
in<00:04:21.690> too<00:04:21.930> early<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:23.040> essentially<00:04:23.730> reduce<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
in too early you essentially reduce the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.180 
in too early you essentially reduce the
ability<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.780> your<00:04:24.990> glutes<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.560> walk<00:04:25.830> out<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
ability of your glutes to walk out the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.400 
ability of your glutes to walk out the
lift<00:04:26.430> now<00:04:27.270> even<00:04:27.660> though<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.960> lockout<00:04:28.290> has

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
lift now even though the lockout has

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.840 
lift now even though the lockout has
never<00:04:28.590> really<00:04:28.740> been<00:04:28.860> an<00:04:29.100> issue<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.400> mine<00:04:29.669> with

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
never really been an issue of mine with

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.070 
never really been an issue of mine with
the<00:04:29.970> deadlift<00:04:30.419> it's<00:04:30.600> something<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.960> I'm

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the deadlift it's something that I'm

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.020 
the deadlift it's something that I'm
aware<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.800> I'm<00:04:32.010> being<00:04:32.340> proactive<00:04:32.640> about

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
aware of and I'm being proactive about

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.930 
aware of and I'm being proactive about
so<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.680> some<00:04:35.010> snatch<00:04:35.220> grip<00:04:35.400> deadlifts

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
so this is some snatch grip deadlifts

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.930 
so this is some snatch grip deadlifts
how<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> finished<00:04:36.570> off<00:04:36.720> my<00:04:36.750> workout<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.950> I
