00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Rustler um after I had my Stampede for

Rustler um after I had my Stampede for
about<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> year<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.539> I<00:00:48.710> found<00:00:49.710> myself<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.160> was

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
about a year and I found myself I was

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.720 
about a year and I found myself I was
always<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> road<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:53.129> wanted

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
always on the road with it and I wanted

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.830 
always on the road with it and I wanted
something<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> lot<00:00:54.149> more<00:00:54.210> stable

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
something a lot more stable

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.099 
something a lot more stable
I<00:00:54.960> mean<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.920> Stampede<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.940> awesome<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.719> loved

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I mean the Stampede was awesome I loved

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.080 
I mean the Stampede was awesome I loved
it<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.590> much<00:00:58.620> um<00:00:59.219> here's<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> body<00:01:00.449> um

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
it so much um here's the body um

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.399 
it so much um here's the body um
the<00:01:03.090> Stampede<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> great<00:01:04.760> um<00:01:07.159> but<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the Stampede is great um but I like I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.390 
the Stampede is great um but I like I
was<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.860> racing<00:01:11.100> sometimes<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
was going racing sometimes and I was I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.179 
was going racing sometimes and I was I
wanted<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:15.060> speed<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.659> stability<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
wanted more speed and more stability so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.210 
wanted more speed and more stability so
I<00:01:17.460> converted<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.840> stampede<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.460> Rustler<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
I converted my stampede to a Rustler and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
I converted my stampede to a Rustler and
I<00:01:23.869> absolutely<00:01:24.869> loved<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.790> awesome<00:01:27.770> I'm

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I absolutely loved it it is awesome I'm

I absolutely loved it it is awesome I'm
running<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.280> pro<00:01:30.150> line<00:01:30.420> does<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> wrap<00:01:31.350> body<00:01:31.619> on

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
running a pro line does it wrap body on

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.330 
running a pro line does it wrap body on
it<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.130> now

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
it right now

it right now
that's<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> stack<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> stickers

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that's the stack one with the stickers

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
that's the stack one with the stickers
off<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.770> um<00:01:35.450> anyway<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:38.729> Rustler

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
off but um anyway this is my Rustler

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.249 
off but um anyway this is my Rustler
right<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.650> check<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.130> my<00:01:41.810> my<00:01:42.810> review

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
right now you can check out my my review

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
right now you can check out my my review
vid<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.829> you'll<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:45.030> stampede<00:01:45.450> used

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
vid and you'll see what my stampede used

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
vid and you'll see what my stampede used
to<00:01:45.810> look<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:45.990> after<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> month

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I love it and yeah it handles much much

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
I love it and yeah it handles much much
better<00:02:02.009> than<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> Stampede<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.360> whole<00:02:03.899> lot

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
better than the Stampede a whole lot

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.150 
better than the Stampede a whole lot
better<00:02:04.320> than<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> Stampede<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:07.160> it's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
better than the Stampede does and it's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.210 
better than the Stampede does and it's
insanely<00:02:09.090> durable<00:02:09.599> both<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.319> Stampede<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
insanely durable both the Stampede and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.690 
insanely durable both the Stampede and
the<00:02:11.849> Rustler

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the Rustler

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.530 
the Rustler
are<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:14.170> really<00:02:14.800> durable<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.000> love

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
are really really durable and I I love

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.449 
are really really durable and I I love
that<00:02:16.720> about<00:02:16.810> Traxxas<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.379> lot<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.769> their<00:02:17.950> or

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
that about Traxxas a lot of their or

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.900 
that about Traxxas a lot of their or
most<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.480> their<00:02:19.599> one-tenth<00:02:20.200> scale<00:02:20.910> vehicles

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
most of their one-tenth scale vehicles

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.350 
most of their one-tenth scale vehicles
are<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.599> durable

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
are really durable

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.250 
are really durable
so<00:02:25.360> they're<00:02:25.510> both<00:02:25.599> durable<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:28.300> Stampede<00:02:28.870> has

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
so they're both durable the Stampede has

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.870 
so they're both durable the Stampede has
a<00:02:29.290> much<00:02:29.709> higher<00:02:29.739> ground<00:02:30.640> clearance<00:02:30.970> than<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
a much higher ground clearance than the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.589 
a much higher ground clearance than the
then<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.030> Rustler<00:02:34.360> does<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.610> you're<00:02:37.269> going

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
then the Rustler does so if you're going

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.650 
then the Rustler does so if you're going
to<00:02:37.690> be<00:02:37.980> almost<00:02:38.980> always<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.000> uh<00:02:40.209> like<00:02:40.630> a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
to be almost always and uh like a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.259 
to be almost always and uh like a
off-road<00:02:41.380> terrain<00:02:41.620> really<00:02:42.340> bumpy<00:02:42.640> terrain<00:02:42.819> I

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
off-road terrain really bumpy terrain I

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.750 
off-road terrain really bumpy terrain I
would<00:02:44.200> suggest<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.890> with<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> Stampede

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
would suggest going with the Stampede

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.880 
would suggest going with the Stampede
just<00:02:46.120> because<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:47.080> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.290> handle<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.709> lot

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
just because it's going to handle a lot

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.490 
just because it's going to handle a lot
better<00:02:48.130> better<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.030> situation<00:02:49.720> because

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
better better in that situation because

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.059 
better better in that situation because
it<00:02:50.739> has<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> high<00:02:51.099> center<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.459> gravity<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:52.329> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
it has a high center of gravity but I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.610 
it has a high center of gravity but I
use<00:02:54.069> my<00:02:54.099> Rustler<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.599> driveway<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.560> on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
use my Rustler out on my driveway and on

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.979 
use my Rustler out on my driveway and on
the<00:02:56.739> road<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.250> lot<00:02:58.120> more<00:02:58.360> than<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.959> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
the road a lot more than I do in the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.410 
the road a lot more than I do in the
dirt<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.920> that's<00:03:00.130> why<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.579> converted<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.299> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
dirt so that's why I converted it to a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.390 
dirt so that's why I converted it to a
wrestler<00:03:01.810> obviously<00:03:02.230> because<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.220> makes

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
wrestler obviously because it just makes

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.580 
wrestler obviously because it just makes
more<00:03:03.519> sense<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.360> stability<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:07.590> yeah

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
more sense to have the stability so yeah

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.039 
more sense to have the stability so yeah
it<00:03:09.430> all<00:03:09.519> comes<00:03:09.730> down<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.970> where<00:03:10.660> you're<00:03:10.870> going

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
it all comes down to where you're going

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.569 
it all comes down to where you're going
to<00:03:11.110> be<00:03:13.079> are<00:03:14.079> seeing<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.860> mean<00:03:15.010> if<00:03:15.310> you're<00:03:15.459> if

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
to be are seeing I mean if you're if

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.270 
to be are seeing I mean if you're if
you're<00:03:15.610> going<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:15.910> be<00:03:16.000> driving<00:03:16.540> or<00:03:17.319> racing<00:03:18.160> or

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
you're going to be driving or racing or

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.819 
you're going to be driving or racing or
whatever<00:03:18.810> sorry<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> was<00:03:20.049> my<00:03:20.170> phone<00:03:20.350> if

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
whatever sorry that was my phone if

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.890 
whatever sorry that was my phone if
you're<00:03:20.950> going<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.130> be<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:22.269> racing<00:03:22.720> every

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you're going to be like racing every

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.180 
you're going to be like racing every
once<00:03:23.049> in<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:23.170> while<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.470> obviously<00:03:23.859> don't<00:03:24.010> want

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
once in a while you obviously don't want

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.250 
once in a while you obviously don't want
to<00:03:24.250> get<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> Stampede<00:03:24.850> because<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.720> does<00:03:26.079> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
to get the Stampede because it does it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.379 
to get the Stampede because it does it
doesn't<00:03:26.440> handle<00:03:26.829> as<00:03:26.889> well

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
doesn't handle as well

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.660 
doesn't handle as well
they<00:03:28.840> both<00:03:29.049> obviously<00:03:29.739> with<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> Valente<00:03:30.549> on

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
they both obviously with the Valente on

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.479 
they both obviously with the Valente on
system<00:03:31.060> will<00:03:32.579> are<00:03:33.579> capable<00:03:34.139> 3s<00:03:35.489> lipo

batteries<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:38.459> will<00:03:39.459> say<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.880> Rustler

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
batteries and I will say the Rustler

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.449 
batteries and I will say the Rustler
handles<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.109> a<00:03:41.200> lot<00:03:41.500> better<00:03:41.829> than<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
handles it a lot better than the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.509 
handles it a lot better than the
Stampede<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.359> Stampede<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:43.870> 3s<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.650> just

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
Stampede the Stampede on 3s is just

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.030 
Stampede the Stampede on 3s is just
ridiculous<00:03:46.359> it's<00:03:46.650> insane<00:03:48.209> it's<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:50.109> really

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
ridiculous it's insane it's a really

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.210 
ridiculous it's insane it's a really
hard<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.430> control<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:52.000> mean<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:53.650> can<00:03:53.829> control

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
hard to control I mean you can control

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.309 
hard to control I mean you can control
it<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.639> mean<00:03:54.940> right<00:03:55.840> when<00:03:55.989> you're<00:03:56.109> starting

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
it but I mean right when you're starting

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.589 
it but I mean right when you're starting
out<00:03:56.500> it's<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.799> crazy<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.120> like<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.450> have

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
out it's just crazy and I like to have

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.809 
out it's just crazy and I like to have
the<00:03:58.810> stability<00:03:59.280> with<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.400> Rustler<00:04:00.819> um<00:04:02.819> what

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the stability with the Rustler um what

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.180 
the stability with the Rustler um what
else<00:04:03.849> what<00:04:04.329> else<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.840> really<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.920> Rustler

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
else what else I really like the Rustler

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.699 
else what else I really like the Rustler
too<00:04:06.340> because<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:07.389> also<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:08.019> very<00:04:08.079> off-road

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
too because it also is very off-road

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.860 
too because it also is very off-road
capable<00:04:09.220> not<00:04:09.519> as<00:04:09.700> much<00:04:09.880> as<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> stampede<00:04:10.569> but<00:04:10.840> I

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
capable not as much as a stampede but I

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.839 
capable not as much as a stampede but I
mean<00:04:11.139> you<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.769> do<00:04:11.919> a<00:04:11.950> lot<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.549> make<00:04:12.579> this<00:04:12.940> just

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
mean you can do a lot to make this just

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.810 
mean you can do a lot to make this just
almost<00:04:15.849> as<00:04:16.060> good<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.510> stampede

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.260 

and<00:04:20.260> also<00:04:21.260> as<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:21.890> like<00:04:22.310> one<00:04:22.700> thing<00:04:22.970> that

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and also as you can like one thing that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.940 
and also as you can like one thing that
I<00:04:23.300> also<00:04:23.450> like<00:04:23.750> about<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.110> Rustler<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.650> there's

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
I also like about the Rustler is there's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.560 
I also like about the Rustler is there's
a<00:04:25.040> lot<00:04:25.220> more<00:04:25.340> room<00:04:25.520> on<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.730> chassis<00:04:26.120> as<00:04:26.390> you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
a lot more room on the chassis as you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.790 
a lot more room on the chassis as you
can<00:04:26.690> see<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> mounted<00:04:27.380> my<00:04:27.560> ESC<00:04:28.190> up<00:04:29.350> down<00:04:30.350> here

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
can see I mounted my ESC up down here

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.420 
can see I mounted my ESC up down here
instead<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.630> plate<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.110> here<00:04:33.250> because<00:04:34.250> I

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
instead of the plate up here because I

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.180 
instead of the plate up here because I
just<00:04:34.670> liked<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:35.900> lowered<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.290> center<00:04:36.980> of

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
just liked I just lowered the center of

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.190 
just liked I just lowered the center of
gravity<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> couldn't<00:04:38.960> do<00:04:39.050> that

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
gravity of that and I couldn't do that

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.590 
gravity of that and I couldn't do that
with<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.820> Stampede<00:04:40.820> just<00:04:41.090> because<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
with the Stampede just because the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.230 
with the Stampede just because the
chassis<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.620> it's<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.670> really<00:04:43.880> narrow

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
chassis is so it's this really narrow

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.230 
chassis is so it's this really narrow
and<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:45.440> was<00:04:45.590> one<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.100> weak<00:04:46.640> points<00:04:47.120> I

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
and that was one of the weak points I

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.870 
and that was one of the weak points I
found<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:49.300> Stampede<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:51.670> where<00:04:52.670> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
found of the Stampede was where the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.180 
found of the Stampede was where the
servo<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.570> up<00:04:53.840> front<00:04:54.170> sometimes<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.100> would

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
servo is up front sometimes that would

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.760 
servo is up front sometimes that would
crack<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:56.570> if<00:04:56.750> it's<00:04:56.960> really<00:04:57.320> cold<00:04:57.530> outside

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
crack like if it's really cold outside

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.450 
crack like if it's really cold outside
and<00:04:58.010> you're<00:04:58.490> bashing<00:04:58.760> really<00:04:59.210> hard<00:04:59.420> that

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
and you're bashing really hard that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.060 
and you're bashing really hard that
eventually<00:05:01.480> will<00:05:02.480> crack<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.560> took<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> while

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
eventually will crack it took a while

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.560 
eventually will crack it took a while
for<00:05:04.100> mine<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.760> crack<00:05:04.970> but<00:05:05.120> my<00:05:05.270> friends

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
for mine to crack but my friends

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.240 
for mine to crack but my friends
Stampede<00:05:05.960> he<00:05:06.170> cracked<00:05:06.380> his<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.680> about<00:05:06.920> like<00:05:07.190> a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
Stampede he cracked his in about like a

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.510 
Stampede he cracked his in about like a
week<00:05:07.750> anyway

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
week anyway

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.150 
week anyway
so<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:11.060> Stampede<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:12.130> great<00:05:13.130> um<00:05:15.220> for<00:05:16.220> off-road

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
so the Stampede is great um for off-road

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.260 
so the Stampede is great um for off-road
bashing<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:22.460> great<00:05:22.670> for<00:05:22.820> wheelies<00:05:23.120> if

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
bashing it's great for wheelies if

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.610 
bashing it's great for wheelies if
you're<00:05:23.390> into<00:05:23.600> the<00:05:23.690> wheelies<00:05:24.020> get<00:05:24.410> this

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
you're into the wheelies get this

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.550 
you're into the wheelies get this
because<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.400> is<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> wheely<00:05:26.180> monster<00:05:26.990> wheelies

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
because it is a wheely monster wheelies

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.480 
because it is a wheely monster wheelies
on<00:05:27.680> demand<00:05:28.040> on<00:05:28.220> 3s<00:05:29.260> not<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:30.500> much<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:31.250> the

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
on demand on 3s not so much with the

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.950 
on demand on 3s not so much with the
Rustler<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.180> because<00:05:32.390> it's<00:05:32.570> lower<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.870> the

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
Rustler just because it's lower to the

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.230 
Rustler just because it's lower to the
ground<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.500> it's<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.730> high<00:05:34.850> seven<00:05:35.150> or

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
ground and it's the high seven or

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.600 
ground and it's the high seven or
gravity's<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.990> lower<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:36.950> it's<00:05:37.190> not<00:05:37.310> going<00:05:37.550> to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
gravity's is lower so it's not going to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.920 
gravity's is lower so it's not going to
no<00:05:37.910> tucked<00:05:38.600> up<00:05:38.750> as<00:05:38.930> much<00:05:40.510> now<00:05:41.510> on<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
no tucked up as much now on to the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.650 
no tucked up as much now on to the
Rustler<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:43.640> much<00:05:43.850> more<00:05:44.030> stable<00:05:44.510> and

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
Rustler it it's so much more stable and

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.050 
Rustler it it's so much more stable and
I<00:05:44.810> love<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.230> stability<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.980> it<00:05:46.870> especially

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
I love the stability of it especially

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.810 
I love the stability of it especially
with<00:05:50.060> like<00:05:50.240> racing<00:05:50.630> tires<00:05:50.870> not<00:05:51.770> these<00:05:52.100> talons

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
with like racing tires not these talons

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.480 
with like racing tires not these talons
I<00:05:53.060> use<00:05:53.540> for<00:05:53.750> bashing<00:05:56.980> overall<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.010> just<00:05:58.130> like

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
I use for bashing overall I just like

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.950 
I use for bashing overall I just like
the<00:05:58.670> Rustler<00:05:59.030> better<00:05:59.240> because<00:05:59.570> I<00:05:59.630> can<00:05:59.780> still

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
the Rustler better because I can still

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.050 
the Rustler better because I can still
go<00:06:00.170> off-road<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:00.890> you<00:06:01.280> can<00:06:01.430> still<00:06:01.640> race<00:06:01.820> it

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
go off-road and you can still race it

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.690 
go off-road and you can still race it
all<00:06:02.870> in<00:06:03.380> all<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.770> will<00:06:04.130> have<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.490> say<00:06:04.670> the

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
all in all I will have to say the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.970 
all in all I will have to say the
Rustler<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:05.390> a<00:06:05.420> better<00:06:05.720> choice<00:06:06.020> but<00:06:06.740> if<00:06:06.830> you're

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
Rustler is a better choice but if you're

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.620 
Rustler is a better choice but if you're
going<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.220> be<00:06:07.310> constantly<00:06:07.550> going<00:06:08.180> off-road<00:06:08.600> I

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
going to be constantly going off-road I

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.530 
going to be constantly going off-road I
would<00:06:08.990> get<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:11.770> Stampede<00:06:13.060> just<00:06:14.060> because<00:06:14.330> it's

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
would get the Stampede just because it's

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.670 
would get the Stampede just because it's
higher<00:06:15.050> center<00:06:15.410> of<00:06:15.530> gravity<00:06:15.920> and<00:06:17.200> that<00:06:18.200> pretty

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
higher center of gravity and that pretty

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.530 
higher center of gravity and that pretty
much<00:06:18.770> wraps<00:06:19.070> it<00:06:19.310> up<00:06:19.430> hopefully<00:06:19.700> I<00:06:19.940> can<00:06:20.060> get<00:06:20.330> a

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
much wraps it up hopefully I can get a

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.260 
much wraps it up hopefully I can get a
review<00:06:20.930> video<00:06:21.080> of<00:06:21.290> my<00:06:21.680> Rustler<00:06:22.100> up<00:06:22.760> soon

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
review video of my Rustler up soon

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.290 
review video of my Rustler up soon
because<00:06:24.170> I<00:06:24.230> have<00:06:24.350> a<00:06:24.410> lot<00:06:24.530> of<00:06:24.560> goodies<00:06:24.800> for<00:06:25.100> that

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
because I have a lot of goodies for that

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.220 
because I have a lot of goodies for that
so<00:06:26.300> yeah<00:06:26.990> I<00:06:27.400> would<00:06:28.400> have<00:06:28.550> to<00:06:28.700> say<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.750> Rustler

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
so yeah I would have to say the Rustler

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.559 
so yeah I would have to say the Rustler
is<00:06:30.440> a<00:06:30.530> little<00:06:30.860> bit<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.130> a<00:06:31.250> better<00:06:31.460> choice<00:06:31.730> all

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
is a little bit of a better choice all

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.790 
is a little bit of a better choice all
around<00:06:33.939> just<00:06:34.939> because<00:06:35.559> you<00:06:36.559> can<00:06:36.710> do

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
around just because you can do

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.169 
around just because you can do
everything<00:06:37.099> with<00:06:37.399> it<00:06:37.429> you<00:06:37.610> can<00:06:37.759> go<00:06:37.849> off-road

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:38.179 
everything with it you can go off-road

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:41.619 
everything with it you can go off-road
you<00:06:39.110> can<00:06:39.259> bash<00:06:39.499> you<00:06:40.129> can<00:06:40.279> race<00:06:40.490> you<00:06:41.389> can<00:06:41.539> do

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
you can bash you can race you can do

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.850 
you can bash you can race you can do
everything<00:06:41.899> with<00:06:42.199> it<00:06:43.659> with<00:06:44.659> a<00:06:44.689> stampede<00:06:45.679> you

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
everything with it with a stampede you

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.089 
everything with it with a stampede you
can't<00:06:46.240> race<00:06:47.240> as<00:06:47.449> much<00:06:47.629> obviously<00:06:48.169> but<00:06:48.860> it<00:06:48.979> has

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
can't race as much obviously but it has

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.749 
can't race as much obviously but it has
better<00:06:49.339> off-road<00:06:49.879> capabilities<00:06:50.629> and<00:06:51.759> we'll

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
better off-road capabilities and we'll

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.529 
better off-road capabilities and we'll
leave<00:06:52.969> it<00:06:53.089> at<00:06:53.179> that

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
leave it at that

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.020 
leave it at that
bye
