hi EDX from LP power here welcome to the
show<00:00:08.420> where<00:00:08.629> we<00:00:08.870> discuss<00:00:09.200> how<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:09.440> translate

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
show where we discuss how to translate

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.840 
show where we discuss how to translate
from<00:00:10.790> new<00:00:10.910> life<00:00:11.090> into<00:00:11.360> legal<00:00:11.950> this<00:00:12.950> time<00:00:13.250> we

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
from new life into legal this time we

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.700 
from new life into legal this time we
look<00:00:14.030> at<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.300> basics<00:00:14.750> of<00:00:14.870> a<00:00:15.020> lego<00:00:15.260> climatic

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
look at the basics of a lego climatic

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.130 
look at the basics of a lego climatic
engine<00:00:16.070> for<00:00:16.730> this<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:17.060> have<00:00:17.390> prepared<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:17.960> 1

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
engine for this I have prepared a 1

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.160 
engine for this I have prepared a 1
cylinder<00:00:18.410> engine<00:00:19.330> since<00:00:20.330> I'm<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:20.570> fan<00:00:20.810> of<00:00:20.840> steam

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
cylinder engine since I'm a fan of steam

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.019 
cylinder engine since I'm a fan of steam
engines<00:00:21.500> I've<00:00:21.680> built<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.400> cylinder<00:00:22.880> and

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
engines I've built the cylinder and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.720 
engines I've built the cylinder and
valve<00:00:23.300> assembly<00:00:23.450> separately<00:00:24.290> the<00:00:25.250> same<00:00:25.490> time

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
valve assembly separately the same time

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.109 
valve assembly separately the same time
it<00:00:26.060> makes<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.810> function<00:00:26.990> clearer<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.820> what<00:00:28.970> we

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
it makes the function clearer so what we

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.240 
it makes the function clearer so what we
have<00:00:29.270> here<00:00:29.539> is<00:00:29.690> a<00:00:29.750> single<00:00:30.140> cylinder<00:00:30.529> that<00:00:31.100> is

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
have here is a single cylinder that is

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
the crank we are an 8 start

the crank we are an 8 start
con<00:00:42.410> rod<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:43.610> longer<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:44.030> con<00:00:44.210> rods<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.750> an

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.920 
con rod the longer the con rods on an
engine<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.920> better<00:00:46.129> but<00:00:46.790> sometimes<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.750> have

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
engine the better but sometimes you have

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.450 
engine the better but sometimes you have
to<00:00:48.140> have<00:00:48.260> them<00:00:48.470> shorter<00:00:48.949> because<00:00:49.190> of

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
to have them shorter because of

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.539 
to have them shorter because of
packaging<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.989> engine<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.890> double-acting

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
packaging the engine is a double-acting

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.850 
packaging the engine is a double-acting
design<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.540> cylinder<00:00:53.809> produces<00:00:54.409> work<00:00:54.650> on

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
design so the cylinder produces work on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.250 
design so the cylinder produces work on
the<00:00:55.010> up<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.430> down<00:00:55.760> stroke<00:00:56.059> like<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:56.989> steam

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
the up and down stroke like a steam

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.530 
the up and down stroke like a steam
engine<00:00:57.400> all<00:00:58.400> you<00:00:58.670> need<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.059> source<00:00:59.390> of

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
engine all you need is a source of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.979 
engine all you need is a source of
compressed<00:00:59.960> gas<00:01:00.049> or<00:01:00.500> steam<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.400> it<00:01:01.580> runs

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
compressed gas or steam and it runs

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.780 
compressed gas or steam and it runs
because<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.350> is<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:03.500> one<00:01:03.739> cylinder<00:01:04.070> engine<00:01:04.460> we

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
because this is a one cylinder engine we

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.270 
because this is a one cylinder engine we
also<00:01:05.000> need<00:01:05.299> to<00:01:05.449> have<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.659> flywheel<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.680> overcome

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
also need to have a flywheel to overcome

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.930 
also need to have a flywheel to overcome
the<00:01:07.580> top<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.030> bottom<00:01:08.270> dead<00:01:08.869> center<00:01:09.260> points

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
the top and bottom dead center points

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.550 
the top and bottom dead center points
the<00:01:10.940> engine<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:11.450> think<00:01:11.869> is<00:01:12.290> pretty

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the engine I think is pretty

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.630 
the engine I think is pretty
self-explanatory

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
self-explanatory

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760 
self-explanatory
it's<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.330> simple<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.140> pictures<00:01:15.500> should

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
it's so simple that the pictures should

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.859 
it's so simple that the pictures should
be<00:01:16.009> more<00:01:16.189> than<00:01:16.369> enough<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.299> let's<00:01:17.509> watch<00:01:17.689> it

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
be more than enough so let's watch it

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.039 
be more than enough so let's watch it
run<00:01:18.049> for<00:01:18.289> me<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:19.250> does<00:01:19.430> only<00:01:19.640> about<00:01:19.909> 700<00:01:20.270> rpm

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
run for me it does only about 700 rpm

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.349 
run for me it does only about 700 rpm
because<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.859> timing<00:01:22.100> isn't<00:01:22.520> ideal<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.060> of

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
because the timing isn't ideal and of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:59.320 
because the timing isn't ideal and of
course<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.869> not<00:01:23.930> very<00:01:24.079> power<00:01:24.520> but<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.609> well

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.969 

anyway<00:02:00.330> that's<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.020> today<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.830> see

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
anyway that's it for today you can see

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
anyway that's it for today you can see
