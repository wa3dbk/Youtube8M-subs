00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
what they call a smart jack which you

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.919 
what they call a smart jack which you
plug<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.050> with<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.260> mono<00:02:06.890> cord<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:08.330> mixes

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
plug it in with a mono cord it mixes

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.870 
plug it in with a mono cord it mixes
