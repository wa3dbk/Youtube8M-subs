nautilus negative workout now Nautilus
negative<00:00:20.400> workout<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.970> completely<00:00:21.600> different

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
negative workout is completely different

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
negative workout is completely different

program<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
program so the first thing you have to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
program so the first thing you have to
do<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> put<00:00:27.029> aside<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.630> basic<00:00:28.170> Nautilus

there's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> couple<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> things<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.739> are

there's a couple of things that are

there's a couple of things that are

different the first thing is that the

different the first thing is that the

maximum of about ten now again you would

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.170 
maximum of about ten now again you would
follow<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.079> train<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.280> fail<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.699> principle

follow the train to fail your principle

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
follow the train to fail your principle
which<00:01:00.359> means<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.109> 11<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.680> 12

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
which means if you can do 11 or 12

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
which means if you can do 11 or 12
repetitions<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> given<00:01:03.030> day<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.690> don't

basic changes in the differences in a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.520 
basic changes in the differences in a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
negative workout now one of the problems

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
negative workout now one of the problems
with<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> negative<00:01:56.310> workout<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> first<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> all

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
with a negative workout is first of all

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.340 
with a negative workout is first of all
they<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.829> very<00:01:59.369> dangerous<00:01:59.719> if<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> person

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
they can be very dangerous if the person

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.649 
they can be very dangerous if the person
helping<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.829> through<00:02:02.070> your<00:02:02.219> program<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
helping you through your program and it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
helping you through your program and it
does<00:02:03.930> require<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> training<00:02:04.740> partner<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
does require a training partner so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.389 
does require a training partner so
that's<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.060> disadvantage<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.259> ways<00:02:07.439> the

if they do not release the weight slowly

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.070

there's<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.430> chance<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.850> getting<00:02:15.970> hurt<00:02:16.330> I'll

second and if you don't control the
movement<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.820> could<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.210> hurt<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.600> don't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
movement you could get hurt so don't

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.960 
movement you could get hurt so don't
just<00:02:23.140> drop<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.710> weight<00:02:23.860> around<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.640> enable

just drop the weight around to enable

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.550 
just drop the weight around to enable
yourself<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.540> more<00:02:25.810> weight<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.200> must

yourself to use more weight you must

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.070 
yourself to use more weight you must
control<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.450> other<00:02:28.660> disadvantage

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
control it now the other disadvantage

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.860 
control it now the other disadvantage
