hello my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a
software<00:00:06.529> developer<00:00:07.930> in<00:00:08.930> this<00:00:09.320> clip<00:00:09.650> I<00:00:09.860> will

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
software developer in this clip I will

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.480 
software developer in this clip I will
show<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:10.370> how<00:00:10.610> to<00:00:10.639> make<00:00:10.910> columns<00:00:11.389> on<00:00:11.660> HTML<00:00:12.590> we

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
show you how to make columns on HTML we

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.430 
show you how to make columns on HTML we
are<00:00:13.580> working<00:00:13.940> with<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.150> same<00:00:14.389> file<00:00:14.750> with<00:00:15.139> some

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
are working with the same file with some

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.730 
are working with the same file with some
basic<00:00:15.949> HTML<00:00:16.129> tags<00:00:17.090> in<00:00:18.080> order<00:00:18.320> to<00:00:18.440> create

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
basic HTML tags in order to create

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.130 
basic HTML tags in order to create
columns<00:00:19.060> firstly<00:00:20.060> we<00:00:20.240> have<00:00:20.270> to<00:00:20.420> introduce<00:00:20.720> a

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
columns firstly we have to introduce a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.080 
columns firstly we have to introduce a
new<00:00:21.350> HTML<00:00:21.980> tag<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:23.150> table<00:00:23.570> tag<00:00:27.820> let's<00:00:28.820> specify

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
new HTML tag the table tag let's specify

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.660 
new HTML tag the table tag let's specify
that<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.020> table<00:00:30.410> borders<00:00:30.860> should<00:00:31.250> have<00:00:31.430> two

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
that the table borders should have two

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:39.069 
that the table borders should have two
pixels<00:00:32.239> in<00:00:32.480> size

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.779 

this<00:00:40.079> way<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> columns<00:00:41.519> better

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
this way you can see the columns better

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.689 
this way you can see the columns better
a<00:00:42.120> table<00:00:42.929> is<00:00:43.050> composed<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.649> rows<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.339> are

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
a table is composed of rows which are

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.790 
a table is composed of rows which are
horizontal<00:00:44.909> and<00:00:45.570> columns<00:00:46.409> which<00:00:46.680> are

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
horizontal and columns which are

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
horizontal and columns which are
vertical<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:48.180> defining<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.809> table<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.559> have

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
vertical when defining a table we have

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
vertical when defining a table we have
to<00:00:49.829> create<00:00:50.129> tags<00:00:50.429> that<00:00:50.729> would<00:00:50.879> represent<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to create tags that would represent the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.399 
to create tags that would represent the
table<00:00:51.839> from<00:00:52.050> top<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.409> down<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.600> table

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
table from top to down we use a table

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.849 
table from top to down we use a table
row<00:00:55.739> tag<00:00:59.269> for<00:01:00.269> each<00:01:00.539> horizontal<00:01:00.960> line<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
row tag for each horizontal line of

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
row tag for each horizontal line of
information<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:03.479> matter<00:01:03.510> how<00:01:03.960> many

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
information we want no matter how many

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.130 
information we want no matter how many
columns<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.270> inside<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.450> tag<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
columns we have inside this tag you can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.960 
columns we have inside this tag you can
use<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.710> align<00:01:08.039> tag<00:01:12.860> inside<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> table<00:01:14.340> row<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
use an align tag inside the table row we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
use an align tag inside the table row we
define<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> table<00:01:15.929> data<00:01:16.200> tags<00:01:21.950> we<00:01:22.950> define<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
define the table data tags we define a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820 
define the table data tags we define a
table<00:01:23.909> data<00:01:24.149> tag<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.899> each<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> columns

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
table data tag for each of the columns

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
table data tag for each of the columns
that<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.399> on<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.819> table<00:01:27.179> also<00:01:28.170> let's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that we want on the table also let's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.350 
that we want on the table also let's
give<00:01:28.709> them<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> width<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> 200<00:01:30.209> pixels

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.300 

let's<00:01:37.360> say<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:37.960> we<00:01:38.140> want<00:01:38.620> only<00:01:38.890> three

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
let's say that we want only three

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.660 
let's say that we want only three
columns<00:01:39.730> then<00:01:40.630> let's<00:01:41.140> define<00:01:41.560> three<00:01:42.040> table

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
columns then let's define three table

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.420 
columns then let's define three table
data<00:01:42.970> tags<00:01:43.300> by<00:01:43.870> copying<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> first<00:01:44.800> column

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
data tags by copying the first column

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.830 
data tags by copying the first column
tags<00:01:49.830> now<00:01:50.830> let's<00:01:51.430> enter<00:01:51.670> some<00:01:51.970> data<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.540> each

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
tags now let's enter some data on each

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.840 
tags now let's enter some data on each
of<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.260> tags

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.779 

copy<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.119> table<00:02:03.359> row<00:02:03.810> tags<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.560> paste<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.460> two

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
copy the table row tags and paste it two

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.080 
copy the table row tags and paste it two
times<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.840> create<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> total<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.799> three<00:02:08.129> rows

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.990 

now<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> three<00:02:13.080> by<00:02:13.410> three<00:02:13.440> table<00:02:14.160> for

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
now we have a three by three table for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.059 
now we have a three by three table for
each<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> table<00:02:15.840> rows<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.739> define<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
each of the table rows you can define a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.160 
each of the table rows you can define a
different<00:02:17.580> alignment<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:24.390> save<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.930> file

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
different alignment now save the file

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:36.210 
different alignment now save the file
and<00:02:25.410> refresh<00:02:25.709> your<00:02:26.069> browser

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.130 

I'm<00:02:37.220> Luis<00:02:37.519> Estrada<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.120> I've<00:02:38.629> just<00:02:38.660> shown<00:02:39.110> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
I'm Luis Estrada and I've just shown you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.450 
I'm Luis Estrada and I've just shown you
how<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.620> create<00:02:40.040> web<00:02:40.280> pages<00:02:40.310> using<00:02:41.090> HTML
