00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.090

 our armed forces are composed of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.829
 by the army and navy 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.449
 Brazilian navy is the oldest of the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.090
 three forces and had its creation in 1786 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 it is considered the largest naval force in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.660
 latin america and one of the 15 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.500
 world's powerful 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.189
 already the Brazilian army was created in 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.260
 1822 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.659
 he is considered the army with the greatest 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.340
 number of employees in Latin America and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.790
 which has the largest number of billionaires 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 of South America, the sky also 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 recognized internationally for having 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.470
 the best and most well-trained unit 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 troops in the jungle and finally the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 was created in 1941 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.079
 being considered the largest and most 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.329
 powerful air force of latin america 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.799
 the Brazilian armed forces have already 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.140
 in dozens of battle 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 including in the first and second wars 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 world 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.799
 already in peace today there is a retraction 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.860
 at the time in countries with internal problems 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.590
 like Haiti and also in our own 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.569
 defense 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.310
 our armed forces are also one of the 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.170
 15 most powerful on the planet 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.729
 Mr. specialists ranging your 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.799
 position and take the first 15 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.020
 being that according to progress of 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.079
 improvements in the budget of the three 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.049
 the squid from the government if the Brazil 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.989
 positioned in tenth place among 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.750
 countries that invest more in defense but 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.299
 good part of its budget is invested 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.700
 the payment of military personnel what 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.590
 They make a little money to purchase and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.879
 technological investment 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.739
 military equipment 27 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.450
 but we must also emphasize that since 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.010
 a decade ago 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 the government has become more interested 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
 invest in the forces at the moment we are 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.510
 including financing of projects 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 military and even encouraging 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.140
 industry but our neighbors do not 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.079
 far behind countries like Chile 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.849
 turkey has a tradition of advancing 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.549
 gradually their projects and 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.440
 investments in defense 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.019
 their armed forces with 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 sufficient level of protection at 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.329
 proportional to its territory by another 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 gross domestic product etc which makes their 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.019
 well respected military 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.639
 already other countries like venezuela colombia 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.280
 started to hatch more or less 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.560
 decade ago in a great leap of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.049
 heavy investments in the area of ​​defense 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720
 which even aroused quite a lot 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.019
 curiosity of other countries due to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 their intriguing military interest in 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.519
 other countries like ecuador bolivia 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.950
 Uruguayan Paraguayan Paraguayan Suriname do not have 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.940
 many military interests on the part of 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.250
 their governments 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.220
 leaving their investments down 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.590
 who ranks this ranking is 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.849
 ecuador and bolivia and finally to argentina 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.760
 brothers land 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.220
 Argentina was already a great power 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.440
 military only in the past 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.150
 Obligating, stick to Brazil for 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.340
 see who sent the most 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.920
 but after a pitiful defeat 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.170
 for England in the Falklands War 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.400
 their governments and pressured by 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.010
 sent by the queen had to tell the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.420
 its arms race and from the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.519
 big disappointment 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.370
 never again were large investments 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.900
 in the area of ​​defense, which ended up almost 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.960
 ruined the Argentine armed forces 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.690
 which have not yet been able to 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.060
 recover from the damage of the past 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.060
 this is simply a great example of 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.130
 lack of political interest because it 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.500
 we do not have it, it's the second largest 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.720
 south america economy 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.830
 the political interest of argentina arrives 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.590
 to be worse than Brazil 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.190
 but the Argentine military 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.560
 continue to hold their heads high even after 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.770
 of the great technological blackout in some 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.080
 areas of defense to its neighbors 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.509
 its armed forces continue to be a 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 of the best trained in latin america 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:07.840
 she's so damn not at all 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:11.080
 be underestimated and staff also 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.090
 we can forget about mexico and cuba not only 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.759
 our South American neighbors 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.849
 but are military reference in the rest of 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.490
 latin america well i will not talk about 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.919
 Drink it now, why do you drink well? 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.349
 know is a very closed country and 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.180
 difficult access to information and everything 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.430
 I know about on your strengths 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.099
 are based on data 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.120
 outdated 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.729
 so I'll leave it on the outside because 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.340
 while the doctor 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.690
 many people think that Mexico is the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.030
 second most powerful country in america 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.330
 latina after Brazil 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.900
 But it is not true that it is true that the 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.039
 mexico invests heavily in its defense 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.270
 it has a large contingent of 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.659
 military 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:59.139
 but in relation to other countries of the 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:01.479
 latin america he is very out of 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.139
 technologically ie has a large 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.990
 blackout in its military technology pm and 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.169
 equipment compared to other 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.020
 countries 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.699
 not to mention that its armed forces are 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.199
 fully focused on combating 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.409
 drug trafficking 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.020
 this differs greatly from open combat or 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.539
 be an open war and purity than in 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.560
 my opinion is below the mexico 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:31.060
 countries like brazil, chile peru and 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.060
 even colombia and venezuela 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.710
 well guys, that's it, nobody needs it 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.139
 to worry because Brazil is still 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.419
 consolidated as a military liberace in 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.650
 Latin America followed in the ranking and by 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:48.740
 chile peru colombia venezuela argentina 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.110
 mexico ecuador bolivia and uruguay in 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.509
 list of the ten most powerful 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.669
 for now only lack I will soon have 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.249
 other current news about the 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.620
 digital world and can feel at ease. 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.479
 to comment on your opinions and 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.999
 possible video ideas that I can 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.699
 bring the channel you 're into questions 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:12.069
 can also comment on this I will soon

 I'll respond with more to see even more
