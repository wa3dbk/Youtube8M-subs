00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for absolutely free so I figured why not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
for absolutely free so I figured why not

into<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:45.120> digital<00:00:45.420> environment<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.379> one

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
into a digital environment because one

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
into a digital environment because one
of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> problems<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.899> often

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
of the problems that we see very often

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.549 
of the problems that we see very often
is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.570> when<00:00:51.570> trying<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> bring<00:00:52.199> collectible

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
is that when trying to bring collectible

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
is that when trying to bring collectible
card<00:00:52.770> games<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.180> digital<00:00:54.420> realm<00:00:54.750> they're

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
card games into a digital realm they're

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
card games into a digital realm they're
just<00:00:55.500> ports<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> tabletop<00:00:56.309> game<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
just ports to the tabletop game and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
just ports to the tabletop game and
while<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.449> okay<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.199> senses<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
while that's okay in some senses it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.709 
while that's okay in some senses it
doesn't<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.550> make<00:00:59.789> use<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.390> digital

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
doesn't really make use of the digital

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.160 
doesn't really make use of the digital
medium<00:01:01.460> or<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> other<00:01:03.300> route<00:01:03.629> like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
medium or they go the other route like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
medium or they go the other route like
Blood<00:01:04.710> Brothers<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.250> whatever<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:06.360> range<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
Blood Brothers or whatever like range of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
Blood Brothers or whatever like range of
Bahamut<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.880> are<00:01:08.939> using<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
Bahamut where all that are using is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.969 
Bahamut where all that are using is
collectability<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.780> monetization<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.680> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
collectability as monetization and not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.390 
collectability as monetization and not
really<00:01:11.189> part<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> gameplay<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.400> deck

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
really part of the gameplay so deck

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
really part of the gameplay so deck
romancer<00:01:14.820> avoids<00:01:15.150> those<00:01:15.479> traps<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.590> actually

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
romancer avoids those traps I actually

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
romancer avoids those traps I actually
don't<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.490> monetize<00:01:17.850> strongly

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
don't think they monetize strongly

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
don't think they monetize strongly
enough<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> said<00:01:19.080> many<00:01:19.290> many<00:01:19.500> hours

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
enough because it said many many hours

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
enough because it said many many hours
never<00:01:20.400> had<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> pay<00:01:20.970> free-to-play<00:01:21.930> game<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
never had to pay free-to-play game I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.260 
never had to pay free-to-play game I
plan<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> pay<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> end<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.150> because

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
plan to pay them in the end just because

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
plan to pay them in the end just because
I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.869> good<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:25.950> I'm

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
I think it's that good but right now I'm

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.700 
I think it's that good but right now I'm
having<00:01:26.189> fun<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:26.939> play<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.299> free

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
having fun see if I can play it for free

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.719 
having fun see if I can play it for free
so<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> game<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.590> RPG<00:01:32.520> like

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
so this is a game that has a RPG like

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
so this is a game that has a RPG like
overworld<00:01:33.420> structure<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.979> anyone's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
overworld structure so if anyone's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
overworld structure so if anyone's
remember<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.540> old<00:01:36.689> Magic<00:01:37.229> the

and<00:05:59.130> with<00:06:00.130> all<00:06:00.370> this<00:06:00.670> they<00:06:01.240> managed<00:06:01.630> to

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
and with all this they managed to

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.680 
and with all this they managed to
achieve<00:06:01.900> a<00:06:03.030> CCG<00:06:04.030> experience<00:06:04.510> that<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:05.400> unique

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
where I've never seen anything quite

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.120 
where I've never seen anything quite
like<00:06:08.680> it

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
like it

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.950 
like it
and<00:06:09.220> that<00:06:09.670> plays<00:06:09.970> with<00:06:10.150> design<00:06:10.450> a<00:06:10.480> great<00:06:10.750> deal

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
and that plays with design a great deal

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.790 
and that plays with design a great deal
I<00:06:11.170> very<00:06:11.440> rarely<00:06:11.500> seen<00:06:12.100> a<00:06:13.020> CCG<00:06:14.020> where<00:06:14.380> you<00:06:14.590> have

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
I very rarely seen a CCG where you have

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.070 
I very rarely seen a CCG where you have
all<00:06:15.070> your<00:06:15.250> mana<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.700> start<00:06:15.970> with<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.360> rather

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
all your mana to start with and rather

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.480 
all your mana to start with and rather
than<00:06:17.200> ever<00:06:17.410> going<00:06:17.680> up<00:06:17.800> you're<00:06:18.250> just

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
than ever going up you're just

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.520 
than ever going up you're just
continuously<00:06:19.090> draining<00:06:19.780> from<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.140> pool

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
continuously draining from that pool

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.820 
continuously draining from that pool
so<00:06:21.430> if<00:06:21.730> you're<00:06:21.880> interested<00:06:22.570> in<00:06:22.720> CCG<00:06:23.200> design<00:06:23.500> or

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
so if you're interested in CCG design or

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.100 
so if you're interested in CCG design or
if<00:06:23.950> you<00:06:24.040> like<00:06:24.250> turn-based<00:06:24.700> strategy<00:06:25.300> this

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
if you like turn-based strategy this
