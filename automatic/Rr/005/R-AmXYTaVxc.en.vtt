00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 A secret for amazingly beautiful hair? 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.060
 Care is the basis of everything 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 I can't work with her 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.900
 not properly taken care of. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.500
 I compare this with my work in the garden. 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.520
 I like to work in the garden. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 If I have a bad soil, 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.160
 nothing will grow there. 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.800
 I have to work the soil, 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 these feed, 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.620
 give energy and water, 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.880
 so that something can grow. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 We introduce the Kadus Professional Care collection 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.260
 New professional language of hair 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.520
 The new packaging is enchanting. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 It has a more graphic element, is more intuitive. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.300
 Have every benefit of the shampoo 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.480
 we have educational material that explains it, 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.840
 making it easier for us to navigate through the products, 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.840
 and easier for the customer to understand which product we are talking about. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 Immediate results 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.740
 I think this line is very good for immediate hair recovery. 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.600
 So when I use products from this line 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.000
 can I get immediate results 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.640
 and furthermore, without a doubt, recommend the products for home use. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.120
 The questions that my customers ask me the most 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.380
 whether there are care products that are fast and effective. 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.580
 My answer is "yes, they exist", and then I use them in the salon, 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.320
 and of course customers can also use them at home. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.600
 Care is a secret for your success in the salon 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.240
 And the customers who are going to buy a product, or the readers who are going to buy your magazine, 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.200
 are always very interested in the new tips. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.140
 I think we as the stylists 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 have to forget that it is about sale. 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.600
 It is about taking care of your client and taking care of your client's hair. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 And they will be very happy and grateful for that. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.760
 Because it's not about selling, 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.460
 but precisely because of having a long-term partnership, 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.020
 and also because the hair is such a great accessory. 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.160
 I mean, if your hair looks great, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.900
 you can wear jeans and a white t-shirt, and look really good and super beautiful.
