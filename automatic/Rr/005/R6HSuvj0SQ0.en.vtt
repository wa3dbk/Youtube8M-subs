00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
how big your design is and just FYI it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
how big your design is and just FYI it
kind<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.280> does<00:02:56.550> smell<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.269> bit<00:02:57.390> like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.810 
kind of does smell a little bit like
burning<00:02:57.959> plastic<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.580> what<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
burning plastic but this is what it

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.160 
burning plastic but this is what it
looks<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.209> when<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:00.570> done<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.840> it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
looks like when it's done and it's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.979 
looks like when it's done and it's
really<00:03:01.769> cool<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.400> cools<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.600> quickly

back poke out your metal circular

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.810 
back poke out your metal circular
objects<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.510> you're<00:03:13.079> done<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:14.160> hang<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.640> I

hardware store and some clear thread and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.729 
hardware store and some clear thread and
I<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.470> strung<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> through<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> holes<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:24.000> my

was the most time-consuming project out
of<00:03:56.350> all<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.680> them<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.280> actually<00:03:58.209> started<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.959> a

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
of all of them I actually started this a

while<00:03:59.319> ago<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.520> just<00:04:00.730> didn't<00:04:00.970> like<00:04:01.000> how<00:04:01.270> it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
while ago and I just didn't like how it

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.570 
while ago and I just didn't like how it
came<00:04:01.480> out<00:04:01.870> cuz<00:04:02.319> I'm<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.650> perfectionist<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.550> I

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
came out cuz I'm a perfectionist so I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.540 
came out cuz I'm a perfectionist so I
just<00:04:04.030> scrap<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.510> whole<00:04:04.690> thing<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.550> started

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
just scrap the whole thing and started

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
over I grabbed some wooden letters and I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.490 
over I grabbed some wooden letters and I
just<00:04:11.680> wanted<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.070> spell<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.459> read<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.450> put<00:04:14.380> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
just wanted a spell out read and put it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.060 
just wanted a spell out read and put it
make<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:14.890> little<00:04:15.220> library<00:04:16.150> section<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.829> just

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
make a little library section so I just

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.640 
make a little library section so I just
painted<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.669> black<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.959> letters<00:04:20.290> just<00:04:20.500> to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
painted it black the letters just to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.820 
painted it black the letters just to
give<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.130> more<00:04:21.459> depth<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.210> then<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.290> grabbed

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
give this more depth and then I grabbed

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.180 
give this more depth and then I grabbed
a<00:04:24.040> box<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:25.140> puzzles<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.230> i<00:04:26.530> got<00:04:26.980> from

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
like the small thousand-piece puzzle it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.900 
like the small thousand-piece puzzle it
doesn't<00:04:31.690> even<00:04:31.780> matter<00:04:31.990> what<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.730> flip<00:04:33.730> it
