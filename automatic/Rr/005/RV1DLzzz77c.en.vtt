00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
we need to be very very careful right

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.740 
we need to be very very careful right
I've<00:00:02.550> been<00:00:02.790> watching<00:00:03.000> design<00:00:05.089> some<00:00:06.089> comments

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
I've been watching design some comments

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.179 
I've been watching design some comments
here<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.049> question<00:00:07.410> period<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
here in the question period about the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.650 
here in the question period about the
fact<00:00:08.400> there<00:00:08.580> were<00:00:08.730> worth<00:00:09.000> seeing<00:00:10.550> spasmodic

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
fact there were worth seeing spasmodic

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.390 
fact there were worth seeing spasmodic
the<00:00:12.660> actions<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> equity<00:00:13.590> markets<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.370> a

the actions on the equity markets or a

the actions on the equity markets or a
variety<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> things<00:00:15.120> most<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.540> which<00:00:15.599> aren't

variety of things most of which aren't

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.250 
variety of things most of which aren't
clear<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> me<00:00:17.480> there's<00:00:18.480> no<00:00:18.690> doubt<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.080> Terra

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
clear to me there's no doubt in Terra

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.099 
clear to me there's no doubt in Terra
they<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.730> issues<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.840> need<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
they are my issues up there they need to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
they are my issues up there they need to
be<00:00:22.230> done<00:00:22.680> within<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.460> European<00:00:24.000> issue<00:00:24.300> needs

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
be done within the European issue needs

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.779 
be done within the European issue needs
to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.869> cleared<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.859> clear<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.369> think

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to be cleared a very clear way I think

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.169 
to be cleared a very clear way I think
them<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> complicated<00:00:29.910> question

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
them and there's a complicated question

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
them and there's a complicated question
because<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> fact<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.830> involves<00:00:32.279> multiple

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
because of the fact it involves multiple

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
because of the fact it involves multiple
political<00:00:33.059> choices<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.290> resident

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
political choices which are not resident

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
political choices which are not resident
within<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.460> single<00:00:35.640> body<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> u.s.<00:00:37.680> issue<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
within a single body the u.s. issue is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.430 
within a single body the u.s. issue is
alarm<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.600> easier<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.320> me<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
alarm is a lot easier for me to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
alarm is a lot easier for me to
understand<00:00:41.070> i<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.820> there's<00:00:42.570> been<00:00:42.780> an

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
understand i think that there's been an

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.340 
understand i think that there's been an
expectation<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.700> has<00:00:45.149> been<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.780> case<00:00:46.079> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
expectation and as has been the case in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
expectation and as has been the case in
the<00:00:46.440> past<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> would<00:00:47.879> almost<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the past that you would almost get in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.410 
the past that you would almost get in
and<00:00:48.899> read<00:00:49.170> miraculous<00:00:49.950> improving<00:00:50.520> employment

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and read miraculous improving employment

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.920 
and read miraculous improving employment
numbers<00:00:51.750> coming<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.770> bad<00:00:53.399> recession

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
numbers coming out of a bad recession

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.209 
numbers coming out of a bad recession
this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> we're<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.770> seeing

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
this is something that we're not seeing

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
this is something that we're not seeing
I<00:00:56.840> think<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.050> been<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> structural

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
I think there has been a structural

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
I think there has been a structural
shift<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.789> which<00:00:59.820> industry<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
shift in the way in which industry is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.319 
shift in the way in which industry is
adapted<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.039> crisis<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.609> involved<00:01:03.090> with

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
adapted to the crisis is involved with

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
adapted to the crisis is involved with
the<00:01:03.600> costs<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> economy<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:04.979> turn<00:01:05.189> happening

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the costs of economy in turn happening

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
the costs of economy in turn happening
and<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.350> were<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and so I think they were going to see a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.179 
and so I think they were going to see a
ground<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.549> recovery<00:01:09.590> polycom<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
ground or recovery polycom I think the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.359 
ground or recovery polycom I think the
base<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.670> incredibly<00:01:12.210> strong<00:01:12.630> installer<00:01:13.369> but

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
base is incredibly strong installer but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.210 
base is incredibly strong installer but
the<00:01:14.520> actual<00:01:14.850> reduction<00:01:16.040> important<00:01:17.040> blood

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the actual reduction important blood

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
the actual reduction important blood
which<00:01:17.400> has<00:01:17.549> been<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.710> secret

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
which has been to get off on secret

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
which has been to get off on secret
because<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> reflectors<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
because the reflectors and this is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
because the reflectors and this is
finding<00:01:21.750> consistent<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.530> nothing<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
finding consistent got nothing here in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.700 
finding consistent got nothing here in
the<00:01:23.310> last<00:01:23.549> couple<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> days<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.409> people

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the last couple of days is that people

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
the last couple of days is that people
are<00:01:25.799> still<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.369> reluctant<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> make

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are still very reluctant to make

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
are still very reluctant to make
long-term<00:01:27.659> commitments<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> harm<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.040> the

long-term commitments the harm to the

long-term commitments the harm to the
capital<00:01:29.869> because<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> uncertainty

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
capital because of the uncertainty

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
capital because of the uncertainty
associated<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.490> process<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.360> don't

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
associated with this process we don't

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.830 
associated with this process we don't
have<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> acquire<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.240> believe

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
have it but we acquire actually believe

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.899 
have it but we acquire actually believe
that<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.290> hit<00:01:37.829> rock<00:01:38.070> bottom<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.670> there

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that we have hit rock bottom and there

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.929 
that we have hit rock bottom and there
were<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.350> come<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> room<00:01:40.979> drastically

from the current levels that were seeing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
from the current levels that were seeing
in<00:01:43.710> terms<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:44.100> demanding<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.509> we're

in terms of demanding and that we're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.850 
in terms of demanding and that we're
going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.960> seeing<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> next<00:01:46.710> three<00:01:46.829> or

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
going to be seeing the next three or

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.609 
going to be seeing the next three or
four<00:01:47.189> years<00:01:47.460> gradually<00:01:48.030> recovering<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
four years gradually recovering to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.030 
four years gradually recovering to
moderate<00:01:50.460> levels<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.869> car<00:01:52.290> consumption

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
moderate levels of of car consumption

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.990 
moderate levels of of car consumption
are<00:01:53.600> 2014<00:01:55.070> target<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:56.759> close<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
are 2014 target it's not even close to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
are 2014 target it's not even close to
15<00:01:57.479> million<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.619> always<00:01:59.540> told
