00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.130 
and I use this one for the back so that
it<00:03:57.269> will<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:57.840> straighter<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.980> back

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
it will be more straighter in the back

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.110 
it will be more straighter in the back
so<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.440> wrap<00:04:01.830> this<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.190> with<00:04:02.580> paper<00:04:02.849> towel

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
so I wrap this one with paper towel

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.690 
so I wrap this one with paper towel
because<00:04:03.269> if<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.500> actually<00:04:04.680> use<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.519> actual

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
because if I actually use the actual

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.530 
because if I actually use the actual
roller<00:04:06.180> over<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:07.349> by<00:04:07.470> my<00:04:07.650> hair<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.329> better

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
roller over it by my hair so it's better

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.229 
roller over it by my hair so it's better
for<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:09.989> put<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.950> paper<00:04:11.430> towel<00:04:11.700> around<00:04:11.879> it

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
