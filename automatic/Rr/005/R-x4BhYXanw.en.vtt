00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
seams on either end so it will be

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.660

on<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.050> other<00:01:05.170> side<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.770> that'll<00:01:06.010> be<00:01:06.130> plenty

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
on the other side and that'll be plenty

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.690 
on the other side and that'll be plenty
wide<00:01:06.700> enough<00:01:07.030> for<00:01:07.060> what<00:01:07.390> we're<00:01:07.720> doing<00:01:11.700> I'm

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
when you're doing a pattern you always

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.820 
when you're doing a pattern you always
feel<00:01:33.310> obligated<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:34.000> follow<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:35.680> you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
feel obligated to follow it so if you

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.440 
feel obligated to follow it so if you
lose<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.280> pattern<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.820> never<00:01:36.970> start<00:01:37.300> with

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
lose the pattern and never start with

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.060 
lose the pattern and never start with
one<00:01:37.630> then<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:37.930> can<00:01:38.110> go<00:01:38.440> wherever<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.890> feel

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
one then you can go wherever you feel

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.350 
one then you can go wherever you feel
like<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.490> makes<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.790> lot<00:01:42.940> more<00:01:43.000> fun

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
like with it it makes it a lot more fun

to<00:01:43.540> sew<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.930> lot<00:01:44.080> less<00:01:44.320> frustrating

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.190 

and<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.299> will<00:01:58.479> end<00:01:58.600> up<00:01:58.750> looking<00:01:59.020> something

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and it will end up looking something

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.650
