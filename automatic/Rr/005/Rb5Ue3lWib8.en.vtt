00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.620
 friends as they are I am Luis Gg and in 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.450
 this moment we are going to make a 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.259
 direct comparison of 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:18.790
 physical characteristics of the iphone 5 s 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:21.189
 against the Nokia Lumia 1020 both teams 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.980
 have been let's say that reaching 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.779
 different points of the world in mexico 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.619
 just arrived there will be a difference of 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.809
 maybe 90 days at most 18 I think it's 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.270
 least I think that even about 45 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.730
 maximum days but what is already 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.610
 we can see are its characteristics 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.720
 physical we will start directly by 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:48.430
 4.5 inch screen of the Nokia 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.020
 Lumia 1020 against 4 inches of the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.090
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:00.230
 it's only half an inch and there's still 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.160
 a noticeable difference in the size of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.020
 these teams we are going to join them 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.990
 so you can see the difference and if 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.299
 undoubtedly there is a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.820
 there is an important difference we are going to 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.400
 flip on this computer so that you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.620
 can see it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 but see the difference in size between 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.789
 both teams 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 it's remarkable now that we're in this 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.950
 side let's go maybe to the most characteristic 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.340
 forceful in comparison 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.369
 a 41-megapixel camera against a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.369
 8 megapixel camera is perhaps the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.490
 most important characteristics and that 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.610
 good can be considered in the case of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.429
 the battery we can say that the iphone 5 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.500
 s has a battery of 1500 70,000 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.170
 in pérez against 2000 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.869
 milian pérez de el lumia 1020 something that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.079
 we can also notice is the ram memory 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.679
 2 gb against a gigabyte of ram memory 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.899
 That is a point worth 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.450
 consider and well maybe already if we 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.510
 we go into many more features 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.090
 well obviously there are many more 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.970
 available applications and we talk about 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.340
 the operating systems but good in 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.799
 this case generally the ios platform 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.260
 there are many more applications than in the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.769
 Lumia platform but 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.019
 they are different operating systems not 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.599
 we are working or mentioning this 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.030
 detail the weight is not 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.790
 significant 45 grams lighter the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.150
 iphone5 s has a weight of 112 grams 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.940
 against 158 ​​grams of the lumia 1020 we go 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.000
 that you see a bit how it is 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.510
 constituted this team we are going to 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.069
 compare it for you to check here 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.120
 we see for example in this case there is no 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.870
 nothing in the case of the lumia the case of the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.269
 iphone here we see the entry for 5 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.750
 here we see how it is constituted in the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.750
 part 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.340
 lower here at the bottom 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.150
 also from the iphone here they are 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.849
 the speakers 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.380
 here we can also see the button 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.480
 iphone home and well if we rotate 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.450
 the lumia here we see the entrance to the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.140
 sim here the entry for hearing aids here 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.140
 is also 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.300
 the button to activate the vibration 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.800
 we also see the volume buttons 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.050
 here are volume buttons 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.810
 with the home button and the dedicated button 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.940
 towards the camera there are noticeable differences 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.360
 between both teams 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.740
 and well here you can see it in a way 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.360
 direct both teams are in 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.970
 Mexico 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.340
 you can already buy them and you can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.290
 determine which one you prefer 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.600
 I can say that if you are interested in 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.750
 photography the truth is that the nokia of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.720
 awesome way it takes very good 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.750
 photos but in short if it is tradition that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.210
 have 64-bit printers in the case 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.460
 of the iphone 5 that is a past of 32 the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.310
 fingerprint reader there is nothing 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.490
 similar in the case of the lumia 1020 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.160
 but you can check much more than 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.070
 the explanations of these teams in 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.590
