00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.320
 we had 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.410
 Hello 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.050
 hello how about people from my point is I'm 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.720
 here I am with my student now it is created 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.059
 do not watch hello spinoza diver 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.610
 mexicana how are you really great 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.160
 well it's the first time we have a 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.520
 invited to whom at my point is and is a 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.440
 honor that you are you and you're almost there for 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.410
 go to the Olympics not how do you feel 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.270
 well the truth is I am very happy with my 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.700
 third Olympic games ok I'm 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.500
 excited very motivated I think they are 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.800
 some olympic games that make me a lot 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.530
 to dream and dream because I hope that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 these are seen Olympians already met 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.369
 the first objective that was to have a 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.840
 Olympic medal in my hands but the 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.030
 truth is that I have wanted to count for 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.420
 Olympic champion to be and hopefully 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.600
 look at the people who are watching us 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.060
 many times they see us from other countries and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.520
 for us Mexicans and it's very 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.409
 hard to win a medal one a 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.780
 medal is very difficult 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.689
 you won it then I want 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.999
 ask you what it is that what are the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.729
 fundamental characteristics that should 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.850
 have a disciplined athlete a good 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.539
 athlete an Olympic athlete I think that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.130
 a high performance athlete 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.750
 any athlete anywhere in the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.469
 world the first thing that you should have is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.060
 a lot of discipline work a lot 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.759
 heart for what it does is that you 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.829
 passionate what it does is to be talented 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.719
 because many times we like to do it 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.569
 but we are not talents so I think that 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.009
 talent is an important part and I 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.539
 I think a lot of the athletes 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.250
 we have to be very smart to 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.799
 be able to master fear all 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.390
 sensations that there are at least in my 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.519
 case above a platform or in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.650
 trampoline I think those are the 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.430
 basic characteristics that you must have 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.299
 high - performance athlete 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 I was reading a book and now I 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:26.819
 mentioned several characteristics 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:30.879
 I know how to read although I can not read and of course 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.450
 said there was some player was better than 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.150
 I peel not at some point in his life 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.180
 some player was better than pee and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.879
 surely there are or there have been divers 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.700
 better is that your opening has arrived very 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.290
 away at this time then I want 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.060
 ask it here in Mexico 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.480
 it's obviously where you reside and where he 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.269
 is doing the dives because many 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.000
 Sometimes Mexicans do not arrive 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.340
 Mexican athletes to the instances of 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.889
 the Olympians and why they beat us 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.989
 that what is needed I do not know in 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.970
 regarding physical characteristics 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.460
 mental support I do not know 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.620
 you are absolutely right for example in my 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.920
 case I started with 30 children and nothing else 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.340
 we were two of the thirty died if 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.490
 they were deserting little by little 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.530
 but this one 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.060
 and I think it's very important that the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.640
 athlete apart from being talented and that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.620
 train all day you have the head 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.020
 to compete I think it's one of the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.150
 very important parts at least in 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.850
 my case I do believe it and I think that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.350
 I train eight hours a day and that's why I 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.940
 I have to stop on the platform in the 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.290
 competition say wow are mexican 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.240
 I'm ready and I want to make you side 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.770
 perfect I think that's the 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.360
 mentality is what is needed in 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.120
 mexico and I also think that it has changed 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.400
 a lot now I'm nothing else 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.020
 several Mexican athletes that are 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.940
 giving the face for mexico and that wants 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.220
 to say that mexico is changing that is 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.380
 a good start because the support of 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.600
 part of the cradle of what we have and what 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.670
 we have had much better right now 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.080
 is Bernardo de la Garza believe me we 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.090
 They have supported each of us very much 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.220
 I believe that no athlete has a complaint 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.950
 that but if at the time of being 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.050
 competing you have to be very calm and 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.920
 well well attentive to what we have to 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.920
 do what they say 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.880
 it's something interesting there that says yes 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.880
 as between lines 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.390
 I can see that it's not so much there 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.810
 I do not have this I do not have the other no more is 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.910
 here that another thing is not if it is to believe 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.500
 that we are strong that we are talented 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.030
 that we can do the things that we are 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.310
 Mexicans that nobody is better than 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.470
 we the option we have the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.390
 ability to be the best and if you already 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.160
 did if I could do it because he 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.590
 besides other people can not 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.770
 do the same I'm flesh and blood so 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.750
 I also suffer, I also have many 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.010
 stones on the road but everything can be 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.080
 separate ok look is important not everything 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.900
 that you gave us the points of the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.630
 discipline the mentality believe the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.480
 heart but that you recommend to the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.790
 people do not do not do if you want to be a 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.850
 high performance athlete or if 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.139
 wants to go to the Olympics that should not 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.389
 of doing 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.919
 you can do it you must enter with any 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.699
 coach 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.729
 that's a point that's a point 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.349
 important because if here in Mexico 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.999
 they think that because we did a little bit of 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.620
 We are already coaches 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:34.289
 teach and the truth there is a lot of talent 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.270
 that is lost in mexico why then 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.979
 if we do not have to leave with the first of 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.779
 you have to see who the coach is 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.879
 good the one that has results and with the 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:45.150
 you better feel I think that that 's 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.949
 the key to success that you do not go for 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.949
 another way but by the way to say 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.040
 thank you very much I thank you 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.830
 very much all the people of my point is 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.760
 they have not heard the point of paola 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.770
 heart discipline training not 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.040
 because one can be good but if not 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.320
 there is no true training 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.570
 clear and consistent and well this was the 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.030
 interview with paola espinoza I hope that 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.260
 you liked it and well then a 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.190
 greeting 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.190
 we are live 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.290
 bye
