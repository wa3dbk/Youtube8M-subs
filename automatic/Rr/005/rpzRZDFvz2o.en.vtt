00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 so the first melody that we are with you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.010
 we will choose it so pretty 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.679
 simple melodies and old songs 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.929
 which should he not call and just 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.610
 I lose and really pelvis and and learn 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.610
 and so it went 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 but 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 but 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 Well, yes, of course, this is a wait locomotive 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.370
 don't knock the wheels and so friends let's 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.370
 analyze in more detail 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.730
 so let me lose this melody 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.800
 at a slow pace 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.800
 and then we explain how everything is played 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.829
 but 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.710
 but 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.869
 but 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.140
 so how to play this melody 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 let's start everything starts with 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.310
 playing open first string 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.880
 that is, two times are played open 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 first string 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.930
 then the first string on the fifth fret then 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.620
 on the third 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.580
 then on the first 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.580
 and that's what happens 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.810
 then go to the second string here 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.260
 us played 3 1 then open second 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.940
 country then again 1 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.600
 again the third open 1 country 2 itself on 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.950
 first year 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 All together it turns out that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 then go back to the first string 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.550
 here we lose on the third fret two 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.360
 times then open arrange 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.430
 again a little two times 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:30.670
 go to 8 frets then 7 over then 5 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.670

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 and 4 a 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.630

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:55.670

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.489
 5 3 1 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.489
 all together looks like this 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.690
 then we lose 2 times 1 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.570

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.910
