00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:16.599
 It is Mt. Fuji seen in the Hello spark of the Earth and the universe this time 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:20.410
 About the idea of ​​research to make it easy to grasp the daily movement of the celestial body 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.160
 I will explain it, so let 's get started right away 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 1st 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.320
 About transfer grade 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 Necessary because I will proceed with this video and feeling like writing a whiteboard like a real class 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.790
 Please respond 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.710
 I think it would be effective if you listened in the form of stopping the video and putting together the notes 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.760
 By also I video is how to say I'm I think in this kind of wind by solving the actual problem 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.740
 Because that's why 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.320
 Please solve the problem together and try listening 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.160
 But is the word to say Let's start with a description research So why need the concept say this Misekyu 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.060
 Speaking of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:08.210
 Host cars when you actually look up at the sky 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:11.760
 The sun and the moon This is a real earth or argument or broken yes 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:18.360
 The distance from the earth is broken, but you are actually 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:24.570
 Bone sky I their error is not the ne strong degree of Hankyu like a form Okkii on it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.580
 It is still in the form of a seal or a small white or small dot. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.750
 It is moving in the state, such as those with sunny 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:38.620
 I think I can see it like that, but that way of thinking is actually the idea of ​​a store holiday 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.620
 In fact, though this 9 is not, but the difference in the distance of the stars 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.040
 Yes To Hey easy to think 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.700
 It seems that the catcher or the response is sticking 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.770
 The form of the stadium is called store rest 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.400
 In fact to have standing guys I this Yes in such a form try to write in my head there to say this is a plane 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 Up from this child a surface of you guys I actually meters Te 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.640
 Yes is just half sound-grade form of part of the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.680
 Say somewhere ahead 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 Here to you we will have a small cat of the cross-shaped intersects with 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:20.410
 And Ta' stab it allowed Yes heart cat and arrow is there is a problem or heard what 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.410
 Here is Bailly is answered position Toka observer of the observer Nema observation car 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 It is to say the problem of transparent hemisphere to come out later I Toka research here represents what 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:34.319
 I felt it was something I wrote in the cat's grave because I think the problem would come first 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.150
 Remember, this is an observer 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 Yes 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 Yes and this has east, west, north and south 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:52.020
 That the north, south, east and west is multiplied by the Papapa' north, south, east, and west is there to say this is a very important in the celestial 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.400
 So I want you to have a lot of practice in the north, south, east and west Yes it is only 10 large 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.070
 I'm also good at 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 In Yes, but please try it properly and put there the north, south, east and west Yes, this I north, south, east and west 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.180
 This Chii 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.450
 Round the ground plane 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:12.060
 Part of this green relic rimline that surrounds 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.060
 This points to the horizon because this is the boundary between the Yes sky and the ground 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.090
 Of course I can not see the catcher and the lower from here 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 And just the head of the observer 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:32.069
 Just above Yes here it is called the summit a so manager of Misekyu 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.819
 I'm a manager, yes 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:41.780
 And this 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:46.459
 The line just connecting the north and the south I may not hear this a little 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:50.049
 It is said that the city Gosen before connecting the north and the south, but it is ruined at 10 baseball stadiums 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.049
 Say the store's meridian 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.109
 Meridional line of 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:04.180
 Some people may throw it away, but Line 4 is a line connecting the north and the south. 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.500
 I guy I I Ushitora song crime of using and in the roots 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.350
 I that I rats I think you guys even some years selfishness of 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.560
 You and line 1 came that of this 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:20.050
 And noon 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:25.900
 This is this just south and came just because not have been pointing to the south from the stall Senda 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:28.990
 In a good way Shi real to say Line 4 because it is on this curve I doing this at 10 Stadium 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.340
 This is called the 10 meridian 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 Or enclosed Yes, now cat of red square 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.630
 We can write four things and east, west, north and south well 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:44.490
 Because this is very important in considering transfer 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:48.509
 First of all, let's write even if the floor is out. 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.919
 I'm going to host the movement of the gold sun 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.030
 Let's write a little here and wondering I Yes there at an elementary school about the movement of the corresponding 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.460
 I'm reviewing 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.360
 How did the sun move 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.490
 Solar price movement 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.740
 The sun is rising from the east 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.970
 Through south 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.960
 It is Na I Te do it by ne Yes Well it was learned that sets in the west 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.680
 When you think in this Amamiya , how do you become like this? 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:25.340
 First of all from the horizon, it seems that a good king will come out 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.340
 In it the state of this sunrise is Pika' Te Neko' doing this one brain 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:37.749
 So , let's go in and let the process go to the south. 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:39.789
 Towards the final empty of the west went willingly as it is high through the Goma south taking this salt 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:44.999
 It sinks like this and changes 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.999
 I I will be red in the sunset it here's a sunset 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:54.449
 You When something like this it Yes I'll use this Amamiya 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:58.620
 It will be very easy to understand the movement of the celestial body 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:01.889
 Yes , especially with regard to this correspondence 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.130
 I'll come out again, but my name is 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:10.740
 I will do it a bit because there are two things to remember 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.610
 Yes intersect the sun in'll move this doing in this correspondence of voice is just the meridian of this point 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.330
 That is 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.370
 This correspondence that is coming to true south 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:27.319
 What kind of response is this ? 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:32.389
 I wondered how difficult it was, and I said several pillars, but because the sun is in the south 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:34.350
 If you say what this is, it's coming to the south, it's about breaking the position of this condition yes 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:42.120
 And will greedily another Nechotto 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:46.650
 Yes, I have another one, this one, just this south and this sun, and the sun, 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:52.230
 It is made between the observer and the ground 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:54.340
 The angle this second value ordering coagulant represented by red doublet 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:07:03.220
 Of the sun when you went south 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:11.130
 What that this angle because represented the height of the height corresponding when would I have what pillar represents the 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:14.330
 Support of either yet it angle run that the Dareka service at the time of Chu 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.110
 It says south middle altitude 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.260
 How many 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:25.920
 It about doing this is very important words 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:29.840
 What pillar is the word South Central Advanced is not a very important word It is with the way of thinking of research 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:34.910
 I was greedy for a while, but please remember it together 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:38.630
 Yes Well this is it this whole idea was that research 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:43.820
 I Sir position of the point 9 episode Yes I observer 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:45.370
 In the store emperor Emperor meridian horizon, the north, south, east and west are firmly coco and also the sun 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:52.590
 In terms of 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:58.590
 The angle of the time in the south was the story I mean saying advanced culmination to Nanchuｰ ascended from the east 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:01.730
 You have talked about the first research above, so let's meet again in the back video of the next time 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.730
 Thank you for your time today 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.160
