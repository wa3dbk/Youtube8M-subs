 FeldschlÃ¶sschen 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.539
 so dear colleagues 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.480
 after our home game against dynamo 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.220
 Dresden 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 I welcome the two coaches with me 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.880
 kosta and jan olav jansen of course 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.259
 We also start our guests 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.370
 dresden gentleman janssen her comment to 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.690
 please play yes you can 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.360
 imagine that the relatively short 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.550
 fails 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.839
 we tried before the game of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.089
 team to make it clear that for 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.649
 We are two completely separate games 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.649
 here in lautern and against bielefeld to 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.140
 home and that we try everything 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.489
 want to do the impossible twice 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.870
 create and then with one 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.050
 standard situation you yourself 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.579
 This is the case 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.579
 mirror image of the season that did of course 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.080
 I really had a hurt from outside 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.820
 I feel that the boys are not the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.649
 hang heads but tried 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.830
 always say where it goes to bother you 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.590
 to build up the pressure to do the game 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 We also succeeded partially 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.310
 we have already in the further 12th 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.410
 Situations wobbled where you are in the forest 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.849
 hang up yourself 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.830
 that was bitter and then in the second 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:26.679
 half time I say with the elfmeter 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.459
 and the resulting red card was 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.660
 the game went, of course, and the 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.509
 you could tell you could do it too 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.520
 I have tried to say 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.209
 then reasonably outnumbered 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.860
 Defend and then has a voice 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.440
 their two options this then 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.289
 really had two goals scored 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.940
 and yes it is certainly in the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.399
 height also deserves you can say 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.470
 one only congratulates 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.690
 for us certainly history because 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.330
 we us 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.290
 with the thought already at the next 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:06.450
 sunday and certainly all 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.710
 have to bundle forces around there so the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.600
 victory or at least the point 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 to retract us then entitled in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.280
 the relegation to go thank you very much 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.280
 thank you all your costs now 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.710
 Comment on the game please yes we wanted 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.670
 us today from this season 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.230
 Say goodbye to the last home game with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.850
 I think I have a good idea 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.190
 we have that too then we manage 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.160
 four goals have been scored 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.460
 so played zero if you are a bit 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.700
 just have to complain because we have one 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.820
 others have not scored yet yes 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.480
 good chances left out again 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.400
 otherwise it was a good idea 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.710
 Good game became very good of ours 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.550
 Fans I wish the motto 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.550
 is a good trip home
