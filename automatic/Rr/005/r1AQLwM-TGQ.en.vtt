00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.440
 second buy at very low prices 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 go to the link in the description mi 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 I recommend and already know the code 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.230
 I see an additional 5 percent discount 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 on purchases good first guys and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 sensual we are back with this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 brand new video a new series that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 I really wanted to bring you so much 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 because in my opinion at the end fifa fine but 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.790
 it is based on luggage above all 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 at the beginning to start must 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 identify the players that could 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 get paid and focus on those why 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.370
 they won't cost given so that's what 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 I will try to do myself in this series 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 tell you which ones I think will be i 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 players only really bank 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 a prediction so it could not even 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.090
 don't really turn out to be that way but 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.980
 elaborating the statistics already of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 players pleads 15 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.059
 I will try to give him my opinion 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.289
 in short, today we start with three players 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.149
 that is the bays room and giovinco starting from 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.559
 room that as you will know if you don't know 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.100
 the cover will be purchased from 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.900
 Rome 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 I imagine it with more speed 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 plus 23 more 4 shooting becomes like it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.869
 will remain that maybe will be ganged up 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.159
 of one plus two more decisive passages with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.750
 As if it is four canvases for style 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.380
 weak because it could be paid 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.090
 because in a 78 with already 94 speed and 85 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.229
 millions who already understand this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 player could be nothing short of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.479
 devastating so I really do 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 I imagine a player to say the least paid 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.040
 this year it already was but not in a manner 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 as obvious as I hope it is on FIFA 16 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 we really hope it's because 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 at the beginning a right external of this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.090
 let's say with this feature it doesn't 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.110
 not bad at all they really were 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.549
 very little 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.409
 so we hope it turns out to be with players 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.869
 respectable second player like 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 I was telling you this is buy and precisely country 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.290
 which this year has done a great job 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 season and the paper also proves it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.579
 team I decided that he received precisely 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.720
 toufik at 15 mm was also he has 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.000
 purchased from west ham 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.130
 so we 'll have it in bpl and it won't be done 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 bad in my opinion I imagine it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 just a super paid player not 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 paid because of the features 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
 really good for a ride c 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.140
 very complete then with more two 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.850
 speed plus one more in two 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.470
 defense or more or less will remain the most 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.360
 two steps and physical 4 if the cards 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.090
 as if the weak ways he too will be 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.459
 a very good player could we could 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 make a comparison with de bruyn of fifa 14 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.230
 I think it will then be the line because 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910
 as you can see the speed will be excellent 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.860
 arrival in the shot as well as the pass 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.400
 in short, everything goes and did not even have one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.020
 physical too too thin of short e 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.120
 so you can prove a player 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.500
 truly exceptional it will be in bpl 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.720
 especially at the beginning because precisely 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.250
 I do not think it will cost a lot requirement 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.260
 main baggage at the end of that 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.030
 a strong player who does not cost 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 much to use especially at the beginning of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.019
 alive so I really hope that later 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.910
 you respect these characteristics 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.620
 because if it were so it would be something 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.510
 devastating I really see him again 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.040
 devastating though simulator that a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.290
 player let's say it really will be 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.269
 unfortunately my opinion is very strong 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.620
 league will penalize me I'm talking about 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.050
 sebastian giovinco sebastian giovinco 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 which went to toronto so it won't be 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.080
 more in series than unfortunately because 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.180
 this year has made that the institution sfacello 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.880
 that devastating player to say the least 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 devastating so I imagine it 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.090
 he also with a speed more notes in 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.650
 more to say more a defense plus two 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.239
 passages plus one physical 4 on the cards 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.190
 46 the weakest he was there 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.989
 really cool unfortunately to play 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.180
 mls will not be too used as 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.380
 championship but in my opinion in mls a year 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.019
 next there will be some excellent 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.269
 players to make an initial team 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.829
 economic but devastating he could 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.360
 be one and those really there 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.489
 would also like to use in an Italian 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.690
 quietly because very strong 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.480
 look at the statistics 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.560
 already this year really at all devastating 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.660
 this player because the speed 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.730
 the agility of this players shooting at 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.530
 bankrupt ride he had this year 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 really devastating we hope so 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.160
 also next year 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.290
 well guys this video ends here me 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.880
 I hope you enjoyed counselors 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.320
 players minutes in the comments though 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.660
 when this video comes out I'm in 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.100
 holiday so I won't be able to read them right away 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.019
 but maybe when I come back I'll keep it 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.579
 obviously I recommend it then 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.500
 left me like past tring 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.790
 description subscribes to the case you have it 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.049
 still done instead we are next time 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.010
 thank you as always for the vision 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.010
 Hi everyone
