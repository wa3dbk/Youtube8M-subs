00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:06.900
 samus and more than 71 but today i show you how to see sb rotators 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.959
 for the firmware 3 0 free 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.849
 thanks to the level of tourism of the housing 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.219
 not that it's very simple just throw a shoe so god 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.140
 and as we can see 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.720
 it works perfectly well 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.919
 so that's handy especially to start the game this season 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.779
 really like it's an iphone game console 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.779
 to his death in every way as soil 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 and like this month 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 so first we see you say r6 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 as long as the source that added this elected pixar ease 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 so I think you knew him nicolas mas is known 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.520
 so it's a source or 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.520
 all free 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.920
 so first we see the dangers 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 source 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 then we will make changes to the right 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.560
 add on the top left 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 and we will write 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 so if to say 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.020
 as usual would it be more silly points they rise so that 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 loose 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 so if lyon 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.440
 x is the analysis 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.360
 a dozen 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.450
 click or article 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 ixia here 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.040
 many want crust era 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 so this will be the tricky wagering screen of your screen what was going on there net 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.770
 I think it must be pretty clear 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770
 if god takes xls points like this 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 p once that circuit you read in the search bar 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 and you scored 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 no harm 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 like these 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.460
 so on chivu sound a little more than happy 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.860
 sb rotators strong than zero point 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.599
 moreover it connects to account 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.819
 an apple question mark 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.139
 so social paid version and that's the free version of pixar the list 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 so it's always the same it's five meetings 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 so this teacher right to confirm on the top right 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.669
 then I think this movement is more than just an office 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.289
 when you go into your settings 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.489
 a few people 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 but you will see and if rotators 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.059
 so it's an arrow that turns 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.449
 I advise you to put as we think that like me I put surely 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.729
 prettier 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.660
 so come from austria do not 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.480
 activation and so that's how you want to enable or disable 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.159
 application 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.290
 so I confided to him bce according to m 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.339
 nice democrat 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.369
 genecand do it for the study of activated so I touch 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:04.599
 I saw nothing 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.019
 and as I touch him 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.079
 my status bar and that I live 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.509
 they can so quickly 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.499
 so there's a little canoe 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.489
 with the icon of 0 14 so percent and the game coy turns it does not work 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.929
 and by cons 6 days at the highest 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.839
 the poor that he like his tours 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 and there it works 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.979
 so it's simple 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.979
 you can choose or whatever but that destination 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.539
 so this box that you want huh 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
 the left auchan group so I do not know how long for the music 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.319
 honest tour promod landscape 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.519
 take again what a protected nautilus portrait no luxury chain 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.149
 tyler 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:48.409
 it can be easy 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.510
 so this is happy roughly these words do the number of icons you can 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.510
 to put 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.159
 that the country knows 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.849
 so the state council have set themselves for his position if he does move a little bit just 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.849
 especially on earth 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.079
 many blame 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.480
 metayer comedy 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.610
 I had put the video and veal bio biscuit disable activations 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.419
 month 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.879
 kubrick is done as follows 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.840
 and even when one works in water on the phone 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.909
 that make you sound and phone 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.909
 button but all 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.249
 true games like summit briefly named like that so on monsanto 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.319
 really recommend this app 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.180
 this moment we are stung are super good 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.650
 good I recommend it from 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.330
 iphone 3gs and ipod touch 3g what scion company picks the choice it takes 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 ducati has no worries 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.879
 and in this utility or to show you how to see 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.259
 the rotators box forum cap'com 0 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.159
 leroux plus night owls free on his ipod touch or iphone jean botti 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.000
 ophir dead including four points 0 + edr to the next video and his eyes all 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.310
 this hypothesis 71
