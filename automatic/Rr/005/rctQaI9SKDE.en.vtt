00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.269 

and<00:00:22.619> yes<00:00:23.539> pretty<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.949> bill

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and yes pretty much the same as the bill

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.050 
and yes pretty much the same as the bill
from<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.759> bill<00:00:27.150> video<00:00:28.220> now<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.669> was

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
from the bill video now this one was

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
from the bill video now this one was
advertised<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.989> new<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> does<00:00:32.129> have<00:00:32.369> quite

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
advertised as new but it does have quite

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
advertised as new but it does have quite
a<00:00:32.699> few<00:00:32.790> marks<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.449> it<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
a few marks on it so I don't think it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.610 
a few marks on it so I don't think it
was<00:00:34.949> new<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.629> doesn't<00:00:37.019> bother<00:00:37.110> me<00:00:37.290> too<00:00:37.590> much

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
was new so it doesn't bother me too much

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.670 
was new so it doesn't bother me too much
I've<00:00:38.579> gone<00:00:39.120> ahead<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> fitted<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> front

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I've gone ahead and fitted a front

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
I've gone ahead and fitted a front
coupler<00:00:42.409> so<00:00:43.409> we<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.159> some<00:00:44.720> Bill<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.960> Ben

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
coupler so we can have some Bill and Ben

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
coupler so we can have some Bill and Ben
action<00:00:48.050> there<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.079> Bill<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.850> believe<00:00:51.300> he's
