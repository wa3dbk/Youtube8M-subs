00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello today we have the second episode 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.770
 project quadrics finally come to me already 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.420
 came the engines and we can you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.460
 start assembling quadrocopters 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:21.740
 d35 3014 1100 kiwi engine 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 let's see what boxes are you 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:37.860
 motor specification manual 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.350
 motor is essentially low thought to be 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 above only 30 millimeters height 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 I think that it will be normal as we 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.210
 there is a bag with mounting accessories 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.210
 for motor mount and screw 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 as for the pass it was taken 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.500
 decision to use 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.500
 activate chrome chrome legs 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 okay this is a joke but were found 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.360
 metal corners 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 Already drilled the necessary 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.439
 holes but no i think that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.909
 there is no need because the paddle 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.909
 good quality highway 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.810
 but very gently I think it will be good 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.760
 absorb quadrocopter when landing 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.260
 and so don't waste your time let's 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.300
 move on to the finished model this 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.610
 quadcopter fully assembled and ready 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.360
 flight let's see stock where u 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.310
 watchman and so four engines around the edges 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.470
 Rays speed control set 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.600
 inward between the upper and lower plates 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.600
 flight controller we have on such 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.660
 sum millimeter plastic 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.270
 spacer between them not between 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.650
 the controller is also installed 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.050
 foam washers and I think that they 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 help to spend part of the vibration 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.190
 unwanted if i certainly have arisen 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.870
 principle screws and balanced so 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:37.140
 Problems not as a fixer should not be taken 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.140
 be receiver also mounted on top 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.680
 bottom installed highway and battery in 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.200
 general standard configuration and so with 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.060
 what problems did i encounter first 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.360
 the problem is that in one of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.470
 engines were bad soldered one 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 connector 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.310
 I had to re-solder the second problem 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.800
 originated when connecting regulators 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.020
 speed controller flight controller 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.450
 flight must be powered by the first 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.040
 speed controller 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 but unfortunately the power cables are installed 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.330
 and not the first time regulators 3g 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.080
 to get out of this situation you can 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 just flip the power cord out of 3 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.170
 regulator in the first or just like i did 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.130
 just swap the first 3 knob 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.430
 in places but it also needs to be changed 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.860
 motor connection to the regulator 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.380
 speed i.e. the first engine should 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.940
 be connected to the third controller a 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.840
 third engine 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.690
 first to the regulator in general so i got out 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.730
 this situation if someone has problems with 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.190
 connection please contact 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.440
 she today everything in the next video we 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.590
 fly around quadcopter try to choose 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.440
 some interesting place for that if 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.030
 do you have any questions wishes 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.370
 comments please leave them in 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.050
 comments under the video thank you all for 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.230
 attention and see you next 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.230
 friday
