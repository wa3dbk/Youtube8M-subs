00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and if I know that he had promised them the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 tutorial on Monday but I'm pretty 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 sick so I could not record it 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.620
 next to all the work of the week 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.000
 past other things but as always 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.880
 They know that I will never leave them without 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.880
 video here is the new tutorial ready 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.559
 or what transa vice had not seen them 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.500
 how can they see I'm pretty sick 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.449
 pretty pretty sick of the flu but 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.489
 I bring you this new tutorial despite 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.469
 of my damn flu so let's start 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.920
 with two of your most frequently asked questions 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.300
 mcafee what type of nib you use in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.089
 these last months has accommodated me 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.559
 quite with these pens that are the 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.699
 dunlop store text of 1.35 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.229
 millimeters although previously I 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.239
 accommodated with another type of pens 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.220
 also of the brand shift that are those of 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.630
 1.14 millimeters but I have not 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.490
 found here in Mexico so if 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.740
 someone knows they gave the box 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.229
 comments and let's move on to the other question 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.539
 frequent as you choose your instrument if 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.160
 you are a beginner while you have a 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.560
 guitar even if it's very old or 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.420
 battered serves quite no matter if 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 it's electric guitar like this or 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 acoustic like this other the joke is that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.039
 have something to study constantly 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.409
 I mean, no, I 'm very bad. 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.400
 There are many little guys who say that I 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.440
 I want a guitar of 20,000 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 so they want an expensive guitar 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.730
 Well, I have a piece of advice, win shellac 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 if I know that a guitar influences 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.740
 quite in the sound but I 'm not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.690
 much of this is our debugging 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.400
 in technique and that's why these 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 tutorials let's start from the most 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.110
 basic so that we have a technique what 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.670
 most perfect possible so by the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.620
 moment does not matter the type of guitar 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.110
 but good when they have in mind to go to 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.970
 buy a guitar or any kind of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 instrument your first choice as 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.390
 It's always going to be a music house but 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.950
 this does not guarantee that they will 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 get an instrument to the lowest 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.490
 already know that the stores of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.979
 music in most of the times they go up 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.840
 high prices but not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.570
 it's always like that the joke is to be 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.790
 looking for don another option is internet 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.200
 yes and go and that's where maybe you guys 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.730
 can find an offer that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.560
 call attention for now the only thing that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
 we are interested in that our guitar 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 have six strings if I know that many 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 they want tutorials for seven strings 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 but let's go some more space but 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.640
 I am going to give you a following advice for 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 buy a musical instrument if it is 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.450
 they decide to buy it in a music house 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.000
 It is very important that they go with their 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.390
 dads because many times I passed 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390
 this 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.030
 like 15 thousand pesos friends I do not think that the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 you can buy but if it goes to your dad or 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.230
 you go with your parents the story changes 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.150
 excuse me sir what price does that have 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.340
 elegant telecaster guitar that is like 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 the one who uses the type this clown of the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.120
 blogs very good afternoon sir this 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.820
 beautiful guitar if you allow me to say 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.920
 is worth 15 thousand pesos and as you say is 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.720
 the guitar that uses the clown type of 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 blogs because he does not bring his son to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.260
 that they taste it when they see you very 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.209
 little ones in a music house 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.830
 they really will not take you so seriously 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.540
 when you want to buy a guitar for 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.209
 the opposite if you go with your parents the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.140
 seller will want to teach you all the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.420
 store 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.310
 damn sellers opportunity 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.400
 fuck that transit I'm a fucking 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.560
 spit with a lot of money asshole 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.510
 I will discuss this topic in more detail in 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.920
 next tutorials or if you what 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 we prefer we can talk about it in the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.200
 next tutorial but it's good time to 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.750
 start with this tutorial titled 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 pen alternates and what the fuck is the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.320
 alternate prize when you're touching 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.780
 in the guitar there are different types 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.910
 of nib different types of nib 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.680
 serve to use different techniques 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.959
 on guitar the most popular are the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.459
 economic the swing picking the alternate 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.680
 which we will see in this tutorial and 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.330
 the hybrid being the latter a mixture 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.190
 of all if I know it sounds very 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.709
 striking and all that we're going to see but 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.120
 as I said patience more in the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.830
 last tutorial we talked about that there's 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.870
 have enough attack to have a good 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.670
 sound we talk about how to place the hand 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.290
 on the guitar and some forms of 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.420
 hold the pen what are the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.950
 advantages of the very simple alternate plugin 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.540
 make a pen strictly 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.820
 alternate will give clarity in the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.350
 notes superior to the other nib 2 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.630
 this is a pretty pretty opinion 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.400
 person this alternate pen can 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.020
 It seems a bit difficult to learn 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.090
 principle but as I said in the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.760
 tutorial past the key is to study with 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.130
 metronome and very very slow but enough of 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.440
 so much blah blah blah blah blah blah so 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.850
 let's start by explaining graphically what 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.490
 which is the pen or alternating the 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.500
 quill or alternating is pen valga 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.540
 the redundancy down and towards 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.220
 up constantly did not 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.810
 down downwards not up 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
 up down down but 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.120
 always down up down down up 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.160
 up and as I said it with 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.169
 as you saw is a constant movement 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.330
 that never for the movement towards 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.790
 up and down you never have to 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.949
 stop and to practice this plugin or 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.380
 alternate I bring you the first exercise 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.360
 of coordination and dependency that are going to 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.580
 have to do strictly with step 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.650
 what's mine no exercise that you can find 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.419
 here abajito for the guitar pro and for 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.090
 that this exercise is not so basic 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.949
 like the classic 1 2 3 4 let's add 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.080
 as I said some coordination and 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.800
 dependence for the left hand like this 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.800
 let's start 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.509
 and they realized first I'm 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.300
 starting with the finger one after with the 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.400
 day 2 after with finger 3 and for 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.400
 end with finger 4 and it's a cycle 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.479
 that is going on repeating so you have to 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.479
 do it back 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.550
 and so on and this has been all 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.380
 for the tutorial this week not 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.270
 forget to give thumb up to this video 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.250
 put it in favorites subscribe to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.810
 channel and share this video so that 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.760
 more people learn the techniques of 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.440
 electric guitar leave me here a little 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.030
 in the comment box that another 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.260
 topic they would like you to address for the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.690
 next tutorial and this has been all 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.040
 for the tutorial this week that is 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.040
 in Chinese and do not forget practice
