00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
straw to her mouth it's activated by the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.990 
straw to her mouth it's activated by the
pressure<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.830> into<00:02:44.069> her<00:02:44.400> mouth<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.819> that's

pressure going into her mouth so that's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.670 
pressure going into her mouth so that's
what<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.269> activate<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> burping<00:02:46.260> sound<00:02:46.500> so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
