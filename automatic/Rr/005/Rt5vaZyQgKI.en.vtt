00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.060 
of the nests and I'm going to be quite
linear<00:02:02.510> we<00:02:02.840> could<00:02:02.990> leave<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> hand<00:02:03.500> actually

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
linear we could leave a hand actually

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.690 
linear we could leave a hand actually
just<00:02:04.340> went<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.320> lay<00:02:06.320> an<00:02:06.470> egg<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.920> she<00:02:07.580> is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
just went in to lay an egg and she is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.140 
just went in to lay an egg and she is
investing<00:02:08.569> behavior<00:02:08.959> here<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.439> I'm<00:02:09.530> gonna<00:02:10.150> be

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
investing behavior here so I'm gonna be

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:22.880 
investing behavior here so I'm gonna be
discreet<00:02:11.599> but<00:02:11.810> let's<00:02:12.019> see<00:02:12.260> what's<00:02:12.409> going<00:02:12.620> on

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 

I<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.700> she<00:02:23.790> doesn't<00:02:23.970> know<00:02:24.120> quite<00:02:24.270> what<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
I think she doesn't know quite what to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.470 
I think she doesn't know quite what to
make<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.780> me<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.580> she's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.180> sort<00:02:27.420> of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
make of me here but she's just sort of

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.990 
make of me here but she's just sort of
very<00:02:27.720> nested<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:29.250> gonna<00:02:29.400> come<00:02:29.550> back<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.819> are

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
very nested I'm gonna come back and are

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.050 
very nested I'm gonna come back and are
now<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.390> probably<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.959> neighbor<00:02:31.140> there

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
now I know probably a neighbor there

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.750 
now I know probably a neighbor there
don't<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.510> see<00:02:34.550> these<00:02:35.550> fresh<00:02:35.940> eggs<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
don't like to see these fresh eggs so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.060 
don't like to see these fresh eggs so
anyway<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.020> morally<00:02:40.440> employ<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> coop

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070
