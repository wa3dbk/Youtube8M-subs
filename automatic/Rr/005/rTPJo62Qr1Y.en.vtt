00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.020
 Then we introduce how to choose high heels 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:22.970
 The foot looks nice as a woman after all 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 By all means enter in because Hi-Lo woman is more of high heels than Hill species also long look thinner 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.410
 I would like to ask 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.860
 How to choose the correct shoes is also important to show how to walk beautifully 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.570
 We will introduce various points today 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 First of all, high heels have quite a 10 cm heel 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.130
 Weight before 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.309
 As it moves, it is always the case that shoes are chosen, for example, sneakers or ballet shoes 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.470
 The amount of slippery legs in front of the size 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.140
 Please be careful in selecting the size a little, for example, take off your shoes here when walking this way 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.270
 It will be quite large in size 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.770
 For example, 24 points of low-heeled shoes 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.090
 It is 5 centimeters, but high heels may be as big as 24 centimeters 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.980
 Select size by 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.620
 Ordinary shoes are a little different, so be careful and normal 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:20.580
 It is this width that is important 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 Whether the width of this shoe matches the widest part of my foot and the wide part of this shoe 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 Please check the place 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:35.229
 This also would like you be careful precisely because high heels is a place of this father Fumazu 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:37.090
 Very walk the line is there is this line of this ash silver and his father stepped not of the line 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.219
 It will be easy shoes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:46.570
 Conversely, if your own arch is floating a little, put a little insole here 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.150
 Please come to do it will be much easier and get 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.600
 The thickness of the instep of the foot after 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.220
 Here is the part 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 Even Japanese who are quite high and thin are divided in various ways 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 So it's this normal width 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 It is also a check whether this width and the width of your foot match 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.910
 And it is actually this that becomes very important when walking 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 The holding power of the eel Here is important 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:23.260
 Um well how to walk so much whether or not there is that was the lesson of that properly head 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:29.019
 Those who can walk like this without expecting to step into it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.560
 Because there are many, there may be few people who have had that experience of taking off too much, but a model 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.159
 Mr. 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.129
 Press before the body weight is depressed much to each members firmly behind it it is is located in the beautiful to the other 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:43.250
 Walking is a beautiful way to wear 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:48.410
 If you do so, it's like I'm going to take off here 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:52.040
 I can not say that I can walk widely and elegantly with a wide stride 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.960
 So why do you have a solid gold in your heels ? 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:02.240
 Also is the place to check the place that it might not be too open a small school 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:07.440
 And this thin heel here because I have to support my weight 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.980
 It is also normal to check where the ground is firmly standing vertically . 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.569
 So to win in the shop 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.550

 Also I wonder if good and you'll run where the ground surface is called the kana is standing vertically 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.470
 And it's kind of hot bald 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:37.050
 This part of Toko referred to in the bottom is thicker also recently but I'm in vogue ease of walking 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.880
