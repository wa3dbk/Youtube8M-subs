side and also a headphone jack most TVs
at<00:02:33.720> least<00:02:33.900> TVs<00:02:34.530> I've<00:02:34.709> seen<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:35.879> come<00:02:36.390> with

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
at least TVs I've seen do not come with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.600 
at least TVs I've seen do not come with
a<00:02:36.900> headphone<00:02:37.319> jack<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.459> surprising

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
a headphone jack so it's very surprising

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.880 
a headphone jack so it's very surprising
to<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.330> they<00:02:40.170> have<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.349> headphone<00:02:40.739> jack<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:43.709> um

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
to see they have a headphone jack but um

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.940 
to see they have a headphone jack but um
to<00:02:44.489> HDMI<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.630> component<00:02:46.200> shares<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.989> port<00:02:48.989> with

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
to HDMI the component shares a port with

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.030 
to HDMI the component shares a port with
the<00:02:50.340> regular<00:02:51.209> video<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.110> composite<00:02:52.440> so

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the regular video with the composite so

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.970 
the regular video with the composite so
you<00:02:53.700> can't<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.269> component<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you can't have a component and a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.190 
you can't have a component and a
composite<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.209> same<00:02:57.420> time<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:58.049> one

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
composite in at the same time that one

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.589 
composite in at the same time that one
or<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.410> other<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.730> that's<00:03:00.209> kind
