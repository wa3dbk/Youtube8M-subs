 thankfully because I'm best known for his girls pictures 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.590
 because I have many of the best-kept secret projects in my fifties that 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.139
 try to see how to take into account the challenges on the street 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.289

 surround their steps on the body 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.560
 in the city for these two he also ensures that because

 to the room was challenging that this winter we count for example 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.840
 they wanted me to do better than on their hands and feet 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.540
 it was great but it gave Japanese psychopaths 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 provide for that you will have all the soldiers and gones 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.760
 so in something there 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.050
 via a little representation 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.110
 but all the cities I did for the site 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.310

 Australia and Germany and France 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.690

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 from mexico i did a lot of country in the world also a little bit to see how 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.050
 that with my agent reacted m 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.100
 % 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 bad luck and that's a project not that I've ever liked that I've published but 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.660
 who is tearing off a new market but my country is 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.260
 and everyone knows about the vaccination 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.110
 except that I already had the very bad idea to explain the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.390
 concept of just standing up and like that and my agent of the time who wrote the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 text 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 you have to go there 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.000
 cartier-bresson willy reference is completely 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 but formerly explanations Thursday before the round 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.300
 I did not push were not done if you insist 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.290
 in the sacem s impose against the family 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 % and so there I wanted to be not pay homage but I wanted 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 work more on the android market but especially girls 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.880
 nine times out of ten found in hotel rooms a little rotten 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 because I just did not want to step forward and take a pretty girl 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 gold both hotel rooms for graffiti 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.850
 but I like this club 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 so we went to bring back the hostages do not agree 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.890
 you have to read a lot more about emotion 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.850
 people I'm poor too well 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700
 italian furniture 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.390
 to the adisq and so she's here I wanted to represent one of her rooms 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.520
 of hotel as I hear fantasized about French summer as if I were 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.149
 beat 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.349
 wounded water deflation and century of progress what I could 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.949
 make 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.739
 so it looks like this and after the other you'll get it in the catalog 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.869
 it is the man who had made an installation with a girl also us 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.089
 let's go check out an empty room 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.170
 where was she 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.889
 first in the process of 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.839
 to live in his room and his antibiotic forget all his chances 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.429
 the Russian press strachan 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.510
 it will come with a mass 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.679
 broke his bone x and blackcurrant 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.869
 his technique his marks his shareholders by charles cassar this 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.559
 series 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.829
 so it was simple and basic simple but it was about the act of creation 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.000
 for destruction and this always 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.650
 the pleasure that is to say did not you dream a day aside at the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.730
 profit through the window 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.719
 they broke every year at the big 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.269
 but his mass shot the mans 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.239
 short fall do not make someone laugh and it gave rise to 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.619
 pics 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.619
 in the terminology of graffiti when we say destroy 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.369
 this is a piece that destroy everything 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.099
 like betting in a station 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.099
 in the metro as rigged trepanier 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.419
 this means that we blackmail and I will destroy it 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.419
 but then I intend to do a 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.049
 several job destruction it's by the party will have to proceed through the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.219
 mass 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 and it's mostly stayed bombings sensitivity of the accounts of the om 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.819
 such as italy is wearing 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.549
 must be tackled by all his peers on the glasses are sounding the 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 toothpaste or bra survived 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.919
 like sport part and other of the best blog vip room airbus 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.799
 it's a bigger scale Turkish city 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.569
 by the way at brock 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.769
 it is 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.659
 bayonne explained one of the cuts and tips learned say it 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.659
 a privilege of him seems 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.319
 joe 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.319
 nations that passes and po paris 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.939

 people of his career afloat his parliament on May 6 that a technique 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:09.839
 proto sport 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.419
 before dreaming that his room 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.419
 we are a little in the time of the day and as soon as that it remains open 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.479
 tag overload them until then 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.529
 tired of this caliber
