 a young thomson's gazelle leaves the pack 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 it's time the cheetah is waiting for you 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 but the predator cannot chase it from this distance 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 then bring 45 meters from the box

 cheetah add 64 kilometers per hour in just two seconds 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.800
 its large black ct allow you to inhale more air while a structure 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 optimized reduces resistance 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.019
 to escape the gazelle resorts to the trip 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.239
 therefore cheetah must use its long acute to maintain balance 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.529
 nevertheless most of the attacks fail 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.929
 collaborating increases the chances of success 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.729
 often the cheetah males hunt in packs 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.579
 they must eat quickly 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.279
 their slight build does not allow them to carry the cycle 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.359
 scenes are strong enough to cope with other movies like a

 scientists are stripping the latest anatomical secrets they take

 it is the most common predator in africa 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.599
 the spotted hyena 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.250
 lives in the African plains 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.349
 from Senegal from Somalia wine to South Africa 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.030
 It is famous for feeding on carrion 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.030
 but he is also a skilled predator 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.919
 any animal that lives in its environment is a potential prior 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 for those who are not registered 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.960
 it has the most powerful star among mammals 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.780
 once the prey is over, no part of the body is wasted 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.780
 thanks on highly acidic gastric juices 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.650
 it usually takes 24 hours to consume a whole carcass 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.529
 listening on smell 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.609
 exceptional interview the hyenas are able to follow the traces of a brief 

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:12.800
 for miles 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 when they launch in pursuit 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:21.839
 manage to maintain a speed of 60 kilometers per hour for almost three 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.900
 kilometres 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.650
 but only recently have scientists succeeded in understanding the larger one 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.870
 weapon of hyenas 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.870
 but the complex and evolved brain 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.099
 the spotted hyena has a highly developed frontal cortex 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.229
 in humans this area is dedicated to solving problems e 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.930
 to social interactions 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.930
 hyenas could perform a similar function 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.369
 pablo spotted hyena also sells up to 80 specimens 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.969
 the females are larger and the pitfalls of the males from the head of the pack are there 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.059
 crime to which a strict hierarchy follows 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.930
 whoever forgets in his place in the pack 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.569
 can lose an ear

 paola concia 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.490
 but usually 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.500
 hyenas deal with disputes more peacefully 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.220
 that exploit their social structure for a more important purpose 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.860
 francisco franco also the principles of enemies that I have to make the carcasses of 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.860
 other. 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.829
 even if their secret is no longer a mystery these enigmatic predators 

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:51.829
 they still get the creeps video 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:02.550
 taken individually these three predators are not really powerful 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.550
 but branko attackers are almost arrested me 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.439
 in the challenge between predator prey to survive means to have a 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.919
 advantage in any way
