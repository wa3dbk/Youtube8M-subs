00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:12.269
 then due to the fact that we have already learned about 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.049
 the previous lesson with him are vowels about and on 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.940
 this block 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:22.970
 he already well reads the words with these 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:29.010
 in this lesson we will teach such yel 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 gay and with them we fix it to render u 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.070
 we are only the fourth occupation i 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.980
 for some reason, concentrate what 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.379
 occupation because I want to show 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.530
 for how many lessons just a child 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.200
 the hare cubes can learn to read 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 here is the fourth lesson and the arrows are 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 will be the last such training tutorial 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.340
 everything else will only be reinforcements 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:07.939
 to sonny now we will study with him 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:22.080
 cool and now you know this e.e. 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 I like a prickly hedgehog and I have no hedgehog 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.409
 soft sign that's soft sign s see s 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.210
 now look take i apologize if 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.610
 in the background sasha will shout 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 there already shouted but he will not stop 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 Well yes you can not be asked to be 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.409
 quiet but for now he is not very 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:55.310
 understands and they soften they are soft like 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 trouble and how will it be if it's her 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:10.099
 pee 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:10.099
 and if it was me as muesli 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:44.360
 some kind of letter there and how hedgehog i mia 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:54.000
 is it right me 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:56.489
 me-me-me-me-me is now clear to you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.790
 tasks and here's how this one will be 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.750
 look bring to speak 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.940
 like info 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:12.620
 And they are for it as if it is small 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:22.080
 Anime understandable he softens 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:26.610
 some kind of sound 1 and when is he near 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.620
 it becomes a little clear let's us 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.860
 Now you can do the machine 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:40.890
 for example with the letter a correctly still and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:47.040
 the same syllables with the letter and let's here more 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.630
 what and recite how they sound 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.220
 you must sell what you 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:57.690
 remembered correctly like that an hour tower 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.650
 whole system today we will be to teach 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.650
 these sounds 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:16.940
 eat now we will continue so well 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.540
 Now we are in this class with all these syllables 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.710
 we fix it the most difficult probably 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.680
 the moment he is soft you are such 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.770
 letters can't say it by ben 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.400
 hard trying to say something like that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.570
 so now we will fix all this and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.669
 most likely it will be one of the last 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.010
 classes that is, he can already after 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.660
 of this class read the words look at 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.470
 is the next lesson really 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.800
 are there so many lessons here 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.850
 how much we were doing from timothy 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.410
 is it enough with older 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.210
 with children that was enough with us 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.690
 there were literally up to 7 lessons and the kids started 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.350
 to read 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.630
 Well, see the next class 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.380
 will be able for the child after such 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.070
 number of lessons 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.070
 start reading
