00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
to go through all the machines and stuff

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.380 
to go through all the machines and stuff
so<00:04:20.840> I'm<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.049> interested<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:23.120> how<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
so I'm not interested but that is how I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.540 
so I'm not interested but that is how I
make<00:04:23.630> two<00:04:23.780> million<00:04:23.930> gold<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.440> about<00:04:24.800> an<00:04:24.980> hour

even<00:04:25.940> less<00:04:26.120> sometimes<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.290> should

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
even less sometimes so you should

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.500
