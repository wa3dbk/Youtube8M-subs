00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
hey guys today I'm going to learn how to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.150 
hey guys today I'm going to learn how to
do<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.649> laser<00:00:08.100> flip<00:00:09.230> what<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> laser<00:00:10.680> flip<00:00:11.040> you

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
do a laser flip what is a laser flip you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.070 
do a laser flip what is a laser flip you
might<00:00:11.339> ask<00:00:11.610> well<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.240> basically<00:00:12.599> where<00:00:12.900> your

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
might ask well it's basically where your

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.790 
might ask well it's basically where your
board<00:00:13.290> goes<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.959> then<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> land

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
board goes like this and then you land

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.830 
board goes like this and then you land
every<00:00:17.460> time<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.820> does<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.420> some<00:00:18.570> reason

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
every time it does that for some reason

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.770 
every time it does that for some reason
it<00:00:18.930> makes<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.230> noise<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.260> weird

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
it makes this noise it's really weird

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.050 
it makes this noise it's really weird
frontside<00:00:24.780> 360<00:00:25.080> shuvit<00:00:25.680> he'll<00:00:25.980> flip

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.799 

basically<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.240> landed<00:00:30.600> it<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:31.500> kidding

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
basically just landed it just kidding

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
basically just landed it just kidding
so<00:00:33.809> today's<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> first<00:00:34.830> time<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> ever<00:00:35.280> even

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
so today's the first time I ever even

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.640 
so today's the first time I ever even
did<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> varial<00:00:36.210> heelflip<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:36.990> is<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
did a varial heelflip which is like this

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.060 
did a varial heelflip which is like this
a<00:00:38.270> 180<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.630> now<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.560> go<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
a 180 and now I'm going to go for the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.180 
a 180 and now I'm going to go for the
360<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.750> laser<00:00:42.990> flip<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.070> I've

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
360 which is the laser flip so I've

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.050 
360 which is the laser flip so I've
never<00:00:44.490> never<00:00:45.060> ever<00:00:45.329> done<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.940> yeah<00:00:47.940> I'm

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
never never ever done this and yeah I'm

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.110 
never never ever done this and yeah I'm
just<00:00:48.090> gonna<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.540> in<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> start<00:00:48.810> practicing<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
just gonna go in to start practicing the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.710 
just gonna go in to start practicing the
rotation<00:00:55.850> it's<00:00:56.850> funny<00:00:57.060> because<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.480> almost

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
rotation it's funny because it almost

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.180 
rotation it's funny because it almost
feels<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.290> easier<00:00:58.620> than<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.860> Vario

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
feels like it's easier than the Vario

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
feels like it's easier than the Vario
he'll<00:00:59.660> they<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.820> can't<00:01:03.059> be

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
he'll they know that that just can't be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
he'll they know that that just can't be
so<00:01:08.659> it's<00:01:09.659> weird<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.990> can't<00:01:10.259> see<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> board<00:01:10.770> at

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so it's weird I can't see the board at

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.179 
so it's weird I can't see the board at
all<00:01:11.429> it<00:01:12.240> basically<00:01:12.359> just<00:01:12.770> behind<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:14.009> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
all it basically just behind me the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.569 
all it basically just behind me the
whole<00:01:14.249> time<00:01:16.789> you're<00:01:17.789> laying<00:01:18.119> three<00:01:18.899> like<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
whole time you're laying three like that

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.739 
whole time you're laying three like that
then<00:01:20.579> I'm<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.759> gonna<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.179> trying<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> land

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
then I'm just gonna start trying to land

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:31.969 
then I'm just gonna start trying to land
on<00:01:21.959> it<00:01:29.990> will<00:01:30.990> land<00:01:31.139> this<00:01:31.289> step<00:01:31.499> off<00:01:31.679> then<00:01:31.889> I'm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on it will land this step off then I'm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.629 
on it will land this step off then I'm
going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> land<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.459> with<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.270> step<00:01:33.539> off<00:01:37.130> what

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.709 

this<00:01:44.639> is<00:01:44.819> one<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.060> those<00:01:45.179> tricks<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.599> it

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
this is one of those tricks that it

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.529 
this is one of those tricks that it
takes<00:01:45.929> so<00:01:46.170> much<00:01:46.349> energy<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.420> at

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
takes so much energy to do it's right at

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.410 
takes so much energy to do it's right at
the<00:01:48.569> last<00:01:49.319> part<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.740> our<00:01:49.829> day<00:01:50.039> here<00:01:50.420> I'm

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the last part of our day here I'm

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:04.789 
the last part of our day here I'm
already<00:01:51.599> exhausted<00:01:52.639> but<00:01:53.639> I<00:01:53.729> gotta<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.179> it<00:02:03.799> now

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
already exhausted but I gotta do it now

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.959 
already exhausted but I gotta do it now
you're<00:02:04.919> getting<00:02:05.159> tired<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> can't<00:02:05.789> flip

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you're getting tired when you can't flip

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:17.210 
you're getting tired when you can't flip
your<00:02:06.090> board<00:02:06.240> over<00:02:11.420> okay<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:17.010> truck

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
your board over okay I got this my truck

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.420 
your board over okay I got this my truck
is<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.549> loose<00:02:17.819> every<00:02:18.150> now<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.659> got<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
is so loose every now and then I got a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050 
is so loose every now and then I got a
finger<00:02:20.430> tighten<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.849> bolt<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:22.879> it's<00:02:23.879> one

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
finger tighten that bolt off it's one

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
land with both feet like it just goes

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.190 
land with both feet like it just goes
ten<00:02:34.590> feet<00:02:34.950> behind<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.689> need<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.079> go

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
ten feet behind me and I need it to go

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.920 
ten feet behind me and I need it to go
right<00:02:37.890> underneath<00:02:38.250> me<00:02:38.579> I<00:02:38.849> want<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
right underneath me I want to do a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.949 
right underneath me I want to do a
varial<00:02:40.260> heelflip<00:02:40.650> real<00:02:40.829> fast<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.489> know

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.069 

big<00:02:46.010> lasted<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:50.269> feel<00:02:51.269> like<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.629> can<00:02:51.810> land<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
big lasted I feel like if I can land a

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.899 
big lasted I feel like if I can land a
couple<00:02:52.230> good<00:02:52.590> varial<00:02:52.980> heelflip<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
couple good varial heelflip and then I

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.690 
couple good varial heelflip and then I
can<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.620> because<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.769> like<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.069> got<00:02:56.459> that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
can do it because it's like I got that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.399 
can do it because it's like I got that
trick<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.480> learned<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.049> but<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> don't

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409

have it fully mastered and that is a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.149 
have it fully mastered and that is a
very<00:03:00.510> big<00:03:00.750> prerequisite<00:03:01.409> to<00:03:01.590> obviously<00:03:01.950> doing

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
very big prerequisite to obviously doing

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.089 
very big prerequisite to obviously doing
it<00:03:02.340> 360<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.260> gonna<00:03:04.409> try<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.799> couple

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
it 360 so I'm gonna try and get a couple

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.290 
it 360 so I'm gonna try and get a couple
of<00:03:05.159> those

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.010 

the<00:03:08.750> main<00:03:09.020> thing<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:09.470> trying<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.830> work<00:03:09.980> on

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
the main thing I'm trying to work on

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.200 
the main thing I'm trying to work on
pushing<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.290> out<00:03:12.410> more<00:03:12.650> in<00:03:12.800> front<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.130> me<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
pushing it out more in front of me and

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.670 
pushing it out more in front of me and
then<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.600> can<00:03:14.750> get<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.020> down<00:03:15.230> at<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.470> very

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
then if I can get that down at the very

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.650 
then if I can get that down at the very
ill<00:03:15.800> Hill<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.250> get<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.520> laser<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:20.510> was

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
ill Hill I can get it laser that was

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.840 
ill Hill I can get it laser that was
good<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.170> I'm<00:03:21.770> still<00:03:21.800> landing<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.490> lot<00:03:22.640> like

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
good but I'm still landing a lot like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.510 
good but I'm still landing a lot like
that<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.750> if<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.930> set<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.200> 360<00:03:24.830> it's<00:03:25.220> gonna<00:03:25.340> go

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
that so if I set that 360 it's gonna go

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.490 
that so if I set that 360 it's gonna go
behind<00:03:25.880> me<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.480> probably<00:03:32.870> one<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.320> the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
behind me this is probably one of the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.530 
behind me this is probably one of the
hardest<00:03:33.800> tricks<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.400> think<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.420> be

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
hardest tricks I can think of to be

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.750 
hardest tricks I can think of to be
honest<00:03:35.950> because<00:03:36.950> I'm<00:03:37.070> not<00:03:37.220> good<00:03:37.460> at<00:03:37.580> heel

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
honest because I'm not good at heel

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.120 
honest because I'm not good at heel
flips<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:39.020> was<00:03:39.140> probably<00:03:39.500> one<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.860> hardest

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
flips it was probably one of the hardest

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.710 
flips it was probably one of the hardest
he'll<00:03:40.310> flip<00:03:40.520> variations<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:43.510> really<00:03:44.510> got<00:03:44.690> that

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
he'll flip variations I really got that

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.500 
he'll flip variations I really got that
though<00:03:45.430> I'm<00:03:46.430> gonna<00:03:46.520> learn<00:03:46.730> one<00:03:46.940> more<00:03:47.150> varial

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
though I'm gonna learn one more varial

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:58.720 
though I'm gonna learn one more varial
heel<00:03:47.690> then<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:47.990> gonna<00:03:48.110> land<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:57.730> really

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
heel then I'm gonna land it I really

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.000 
heel then I'm gonna land it I really
need<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.880> push<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.330> out<00:03:59.420> in<00:03:59.540> front<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.840> me<00:04:06.010> very

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
need to push it out in front of me very

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:20.800 
need to push it out in front of me very
low<00:04:07.160> heel

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.420 

least<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.959> got<00:04:22.080> that<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.620> know<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:22.920> like<00:04:23.100> you

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
least I got that you know it's like you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.820 
least I got that you know it's like you
want<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.640> learn<00:04:23.760> very<00:04:24.030> oh<00:04:24.120> he'll<00:04:24.710> double<00:04:25.710> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
want to learn very oh he'll double it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:05:05.279 
want to learn very oh he'll double it
try<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.130> learn<00:04:26.280> laser<00:04:26.580> heel

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.629 

Pompeii's<00:05:06.289> like<00:05:06.499> that<00:05:06.710> it's<00:05:06.919> impossible<00:05:07.279> to

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
Pompeii's like that it's impossible to

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:17.219 
Pompeii's like that it's impossible to
land<00:05:07.939> that<00:05:08.289> is<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.590> far<00:05:09.860> behind<00:05:10.009> me<00:05:13.599> ten<00:05:14.599> tries

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:28.439 

one<00:05:21.219> two

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.850 

my<00:05:29.449> legs<00:05:29.689> are<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.020> sore<00:05:30.289> I<00:05:30.349> got<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.680> stretch

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
my legs are so sore I got to stretch

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.010 
my legs are so sore I got to stretch
them<00:05:31.009> out

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
them out

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.339 
them out
this<00:05:33.020> trick<00:05:33.289> will<00:05:33.409> require<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:33.919> much<00:05:34.069> effort

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
this trick will require so much effort

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.510 
this trick will require so much effort
that's<00:05:36.349> a<00:05:36.500> palm<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:36.889> putting<00:05:37.189> too<00:05:37.370> much

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
that's a palm and putting too much

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:50.850 
that's a palm and putting too much
effort<00:05:37.729> I<00:05:38.229> need<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.289> just<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.710> it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.100

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
well I would say I got the 360 part then

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:09.070 
well I would say I got the 360 part then

something from this video I mean look at
me<00:06:30.380> I've<00:06:30.500> been<00:06:30.620> training<00:06:31.010> forever<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:32.150> it

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
me I've been training forever and it

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.940 
me I've been training forever and it
still<00:06:32.510> takes<00:06:32.690> me<00:06:32.840> a<00:06:32.900> while<00:06:33.020> to<00:06:33.230> learn<00:06:33.290> tricks<00:06:33.740> I

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
still takes me a while to learn tricks I

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620 
still takes me a while to learn tricks I
have<00:06:33.980> to<00:06:34.340> push<00:06:34.550> through<00:06:34.790> effort<00:06:35.150> I<00:06:35.240> have<00:06:35.450> to

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
have to push through effort I have to

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
push through it I have to work it out I

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.710 
push through it I have to work it out I
have<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.400> figure<00:06:37.670> it<00:06:37.790> out<00:06:37.940> figure<00:06:38.540> out<00:06:38.600> what
