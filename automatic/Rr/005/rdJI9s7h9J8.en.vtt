00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.630
 hello and welcome to this two 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
 systems or today I'm going to you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 talk about the box tofu then this name you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.030
 maybe says something since these 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 last time we started to in 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.080
 talk on the site of puchov or breakage 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 what is it just the nuj of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 sponsorship that will replace the game of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 water at the moment the game of goose 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.149
 is like that would say frozen in marble 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 indeed as soon as we think of adding 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.300
 new gifts or even a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.980
 new circuit we run into 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 many questions what do we do 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.309
 of the player who has already advanced on this game 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 goose is what I'm left with 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 progression but suddenly he will not get 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 not the gifts he has already overtaken on 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 the new plateau where are we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 take off his progress and suddenly bah 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.230
 inevitably there is something lost 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 for this player there too many questions that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.079
 do not have enough answers 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 satisfactory to us at the moment 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.430
 in addition a modification of the game is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.920
 quite difficult since it is in flash 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 the game also happened to be pretty 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.309
 frustrating for some players who 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 have few invited friends indeed 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 from the beginning you see that the distance 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.109
 was very big to be there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.609
 dragoturkey and therefore needed 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.209
 many friends who accept his 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.700
 invitation 

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.859
 on the other hand the game of water was simple 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.359
 fun and playful and it's these aspects 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.579
 we wanted to keep you in 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.869
 crazy box before anything else know that 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.130
 all the images of tofu what is that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.759
 you're going to see are not the images 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.759
 definitive 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.210
 the goal of the game is pretty simple it takes 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.979
 break the boxes of the grid so 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.810
 to get the gifts that are behind 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.030
 and to break these grids we are going 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 use tofu yes these little beasts 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170
 cute and everything we go them 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670
 use and we'll sacrifice them then 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.260
 how do we get 7 crazy all 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.300
 just in the same way as in 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.950
 the goose game advanced one box there 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.450
 whenever your referral goes 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.090
 subscribe to the games for the first time 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.350
 of football you will win tofu 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 the advantage of this system is that 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.259
 even if you have that little friendship 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.030
 accept the invitation you always have 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.979
 one thing to get the familiar who you 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.479
 interested but also the dragoturkey 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.310
 if you have a little luck and that 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.000
 you come across the right boxes with 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.830
 all crazy cellar 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.540
 the major difference is that as soon as 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.520
 start of the game launch you will have 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.260
 degree that will afford you no 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.489
 panic you can switch as many 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.600
 time you want between the two 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.580
 grids you can dance very well 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.680
 crazy car on a grid then teuphu 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.660
 on the other to start the game 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.489
 will contain two basic grids the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.550
 grid of law and the grid in more but 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.500
 the law grid it will contain 56 box 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.209
 it's just the recovery of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.440
 gifts goose game to the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.910
 to persist in time but also 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.370
 that new players can them 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.350
 also get them the other gray the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.540
 grids in addition but is composed of 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.790
 twelve boxes it contains a panoply 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.380
 but also the famous rue godin that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.690
 some smart guys have discovered it 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.269
 some time ago the dragodinde liked 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.650
 by the way talking about dragodinde know 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.080
 that in all grids the strap 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 men will occupy 4 squares a square of 4gas 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.989
 more accurate, that is to say that as soon as 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.730
 that you will have a piece of the drag 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.019
 to the ladies you will have to find the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.670
 three others that are necessarily 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.890
 adjacent since this forms a square to 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.540
 the end it will break these four boxes 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.900
 in order to get the dragodinde in your 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.430
 adventure 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 know also that at certain 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 opportunities we may be adding 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.860
 event grids that inevitably 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.890
 will be small and will only stay 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.420
 few days I see you coming 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.370
 I know that those who have almost reached 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.500
 to dragodinde su I have to panic to 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.880
 the idea of ​​starting from scratch even though 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.590
 they had only two breaks for 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.300
 reach that famous crazy gossip and 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.100
 do not panic because we have 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.720
 thought of you because all the gifts that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.180
 you got on the goose game 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.280
 are already considered obtained on 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.560
 the tofu grid box then yes you 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.330
 will have more than enough quézac since by 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.250
 example to dragodinde instead of being a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.470
 single box will consist of four boxes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.300
 however, this will be compensated by 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.739
 several things first to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.900
 the opening of this game we will offer 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.120
 rates everything to everyone and in addition 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.350
 these breaks contain effects 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.930
 game effects get back on 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.030
 just after the first feature 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.920
 who makes his appearance with tofu 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.720
 case this is the possibility of networks of 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 its grid yes imagine that only the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.810
 families and alas dragodinde you 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.790
 interested and when you are someone 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.720
 of very lucky you are going to get them 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.670
 very quickly 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.920
 you will not want to finish 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.230
 grid simply you can soon 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.300
 that you will have reached 50% by 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.070
 say half the boxes or more 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.870
 will be discovered you will have the 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.790
 possibility to reset the grid and so 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.440
 to start from scratch in order to get to 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.600
 new gifts that interest you 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.290
 I see you already in the process of 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.030
 rub your hands 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.830
 and well no it will not be worth it 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.790
 memorize the positions of gifts 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.280
 since every time you go 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.360
 reset your grid to 0 positions 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.070
 gifts will change 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.750
 besides all the players have 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.100
 positions of different gifts this 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.690
 to prevent everyone from knowing 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.430
 what a gift is behind someone 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.720
 of course as I told you 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.460
 just now the grids contain 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.110
 effects ie cases which 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.880
 does not want to allow you to win a 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.590
 gift but they will trigger 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.780
 effects on the grid indeed we 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.400
 will have for example the kamikaze box that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.350
 will break the four boxes around the 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.150
 breaks that you have chosen the box 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.610
 rebound while he 's just going 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.229
 go to break a random box or the 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.210
 box a rate do besides who is going you 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.520
 allow to recover a tofu and therefore 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.200
 to perform another throw here you 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.150
 have almost everything on the game tofu box 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.350
 gesture l lookout on the office site 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.910
 points like and I tell you see you soon 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.770
 for the launch of the game 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.600
 also for a new dofus times and 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.400
 by then do not forget to train yourself 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.110
 since from the launch of the game we 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.580
 will give crazy time to all players 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.580
 and tofu to premium members
