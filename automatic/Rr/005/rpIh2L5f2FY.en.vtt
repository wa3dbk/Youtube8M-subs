 is the new book that he shares and that of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 somehow summarizes what is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.720
 happening in our good neighbor country 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 in bolivia de evo the bolivia of 2006 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.779
 which is the one that received that president 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.619
 indigenous with many criticisms 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 underestimating what a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 indigenous to govern as it is like change 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 is to Bolivia to today's Bolivia 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 evo current goes up a little more back 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 started in 2002 the lesson in which 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm going to give a big surprise here 22 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 percent of the spoiled votes for 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.980
 down the coni sanchez what to think 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.530
 that the maximum vote of a party 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.480
 interference of 3 percent and that too 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.460
 enrolled in the water war in the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.800
 gas war 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.629
 and all social mobilizations 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.270
 then the book begins in 2002 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.860
 then jumps 2007 that I have a 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.200
 interview with him for the magazine 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.030
 rolling stones tells a bit about all this 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.110
 half moon conflict that was almost 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 a civil war and then goes from 2013 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.920
 and nine years of government showing the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.290
 transformations not only in politics 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.180
 but in the economy for example now it 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.090
 see that there is a strong component of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.550
 there is traditional hand trade 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.550
 with technology import from china 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.800
 with very complex issues not based 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.320
 in the ancestrality now if you have to 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.110
 make a very tight summary 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.210
 description of what was a 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.600
 person arriving in Bolivia more than 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.460
 10 years and what it breathes today 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 beyond the process that was lived that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.899
 it's all very cool is the day after 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.060
 but what difference did it find in those 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.009
 bolivias and a little what he explained is 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.350
 when one arrived in 2002 he was 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.780
 a chaos that was impossible to understand is 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.690
 an almost quantum physical question or of 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.760
 pataphysics to be a way 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 this case those who move from another 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.180
 way any street of a market in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.950
 Bolivia knows that prices can 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 fluctuate in any way that sometimes 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 until the cholitas the little 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.670
 impart the title of the book if you want 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.680
 They do not sell you if they do not feel like two 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.840
 questions a street and do not know how to communicate 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.700
 they tell you ten different things was 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.130
 like a chaos that after we started 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.500
 find a logic and there was also 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
 as a state of civil disobedience and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.160
 one found as a kind of state 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.290
 parallel there was no justice 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.270
 Aymara community had a way of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.940
 Community credits had a whole 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.320
 parastatal structure that was in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.740
 power of the indigenous that of a 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.530
 majority of a small government that in a 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.990
 state that almost did not exist with a little 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.300
 it comes together in these two worlds and that 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.640
 it generates an explosion a kind of 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.640
 plebeian modernization says the sociologist 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.560
 Jorge well now and now Bolivia 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.110
 entered modern way and entered the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.850
 world with its pros and cons 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.750
 clear good it is also said that it will be 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.640
 one of the axes rich in gas resources 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.930
 not for example that can be the axis 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.310
 central of all america 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.810
 the sun I carry says we have to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 and deepen what we already 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.120
 we recover oil and gas but 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.609
 we have to become a power 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.730
 regional that deepening of the model 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.590
 goes in that line goes in that line what 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.750
 is sometimes a bit contradictory to the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.000
 international discourse on the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.790
 pachamama mother earth or living 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.439
 well because obviously when one advances 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.019
 in that development you find 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.120
 contradictions regarding the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.639
 road of the important type of the park 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.500
 natural indigenous that is right in the 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.599
 half of the Amazon remember exactly 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.909
 that I would have to go through and build 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.459
 a great road to join that in the 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.620
 2011 there was an indigenous march of the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.180
 Amazonian villages of that area that was 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.799
 repressed by the government in 3 these 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.750
 cases like a break in the vision of 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.879
 many intellectuals officials of the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.459
 government and even some organizations 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.290
 social the cidob that the organization 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.840
 Bolivian social fabric and the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.790
 conamaq that is the altiplano but more 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.129
 related to this as more vision 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.140
 ancestral tell the organization of the jnc 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.420
 what is an organization 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 thousand years in bolivia then you are 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.350
 indigenous organizations are starting 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.600
 be against and is generating 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.609
 as a kind of rejection of this 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.320
 modernity that as seen in the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.910
 yesterday's election is supported by the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.160
 most of the people clear but the debate 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.370
 is there in the growth in the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.740
 development to where preserve that the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.240
 natural wealth to the pachamama and which 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 are the main challenges 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.730
 for this new period of Bolivia and I 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.540
 I think those are fine policies 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.700
 tuning 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.100
 how to go adjusting these issues 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.200
 to be able to change this model and about 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.700
 all the dialogue that is always given and this 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.530
 issue that sometimes happens in the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.230
 progressive governments not from South America 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.410
 that one is going to make a criticism 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:58.460
 constructive friend and he calls him a gorilla 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:02.090
 or imperialist not like being able to see what's 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.330
 criticisms and there are ways to build from 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.470
 what is already done and not because one 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.169
 say that there are things we 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.720
 doing right of clear right is the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.180
 exact enemy simply constructive 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.830
 is those sensitive issues are also 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.450
 present in the book by his power 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.670
 the bolivia of evo then what 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.350
 We recommend for all those 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.900
 people who want to know a little bit 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.670
 more from bolivia you thank you very much for 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.670
 the company and you thank you very much
