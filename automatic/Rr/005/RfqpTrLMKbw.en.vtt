00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello today i offer you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
 make ice cream with me 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.309
 real creamy ice cream like in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.059
 childhood 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 this we need cream 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.199
 30 percent 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 possible 35 but not less 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.279
 Milk is preferably fatter from me to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.369
 Unfortunately, the two again but also fit 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.619
 can replace milk with cream 10 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.340
 interest there will need to be literally 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 200 milliliters caster sugar and 4 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.010
 egg yolks and immediately in the first stage 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 I would like to add that if you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 planning something to add ice cream 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 eg 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 cinnamon and or cocoa powder and or vanilla 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 then it must be done at the beginning of the whole way 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.980
 that is, take 10 milliliters 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 milk or cream 10 percent there 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.680
 send cinnamon stick either one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.649
 a teaspoon of cinnamon is also one tablespoon 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.860
 spoon of cocoa powder 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.320
 either a teaspoon of vanilla on and it all 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.040
 rehears on the tile but do not bring to 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 boil 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.189
 further if this cinnamon stick you her 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.799
 Get out if you added powder then 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 then this milk should be skipped 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.640
 through a sieve 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 and if of course cocoa powder and or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 vanillin something not to do but not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 after that you should 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.570
 cool the milk by the way if you add 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 first cinnamon and then already you 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.829
 I'll tell you when you can add 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.500
 for example chocolate crumb is obtained 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.110
 awesome delicious ice cream but we are more often 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 just cook such an ordinary without different 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.869
 adding some fruit either 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 chocolate 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.770
 we like it better we share our eggs 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.659
 on yolks and squirrels 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 ice cream on need only one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 yolks from proteins you can cook 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.260
 healthy and tasty omelet 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.720
 and the yolks will be processed 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.630
 ice cream and so they need to bring down together 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.420
 powdered sugar now I add 5 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 tablespoons of powdered sugar is still such 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 moment if you don't like too sweet 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.900
 ice cream then add somewhere around 45 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:41.610
 if you like sweet, add 67 by the way 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:45.270
 you can replace with sugar, we went 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.620
 yolks ready immediately get this 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.560
 the mass is now yolk cream mixed with 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.590
 milk and we need a little cream 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.110
 cook we put it on the stove need 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 stir constantly but not bring to 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:10.530
 boil 3 m regularly stir not 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:15.269
 let it burn to a boil 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.900
 don't need just a few minutes my 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.480
 the cream is ready now you need to cool it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.130
 until the cream cools we will whip the cream 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.810
 forgot to say that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.690
 cream must be required 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.610
 chilled so they broke up 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.610
 good elastic theme 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:51.750
 I have 500 milliliters of cream 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:53.879
 let's go our cream ready consistency 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 must be somewhere like fat 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:03.659
 you know thick cream our cream is cold we 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:13.319
 pouring it in to make more 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:16.259
 time well whip our 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.690
 ice cream in molds it can be 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.930
 ordinary containers or cups and 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.509
 plastic containers are shipped to 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.349
 a freezer for about an hour and a half 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:30.330
 then I will tell you what you need to do 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:33.120
 in an hour when you get your 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.780
 mix ice cream well not to 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:42.360
 there were lumps from it already freezes 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:45.510
 on the edges behind is very bad and just 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.539
 during this period, you can add different 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.500
 additives that is if you did for example 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.400
 with cinnamon, I advise you to add pieces 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.280
 chocolate 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.349
 to make chocolate ice cream 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.060
 baby 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.860
 add and mix well 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.159
 some kind of filler is also possible 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.759
 fruit or berry finely chopped 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:11.370
 let's say pineapples or strawberries too 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.650
 it will turn out very tasty and 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.320
 accordingly if you added cocoa 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.810
 then add a little bit in principle too 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.150
 you can also add some chocolate 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.360
 look do not overdo it and add 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.430
 bitter chocolate that is no less 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.639
 eighty percent for cocoa to be 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.249
 otherwise ice cream will turn out 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.469
 sweet sugary right now I mixed 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:38.159
 close i send the freezer 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.349
 somewhere at 3 5 o'clock whichever you have 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.839
 capacity and looking like it freezes your 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:45.659
 freezer and ice cream will be ready for 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.569
 all ice cream is ready to be consumed 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.969
