initially<00:00:58.329> I<00:00:58.359> thought<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.750> was<00:00:58.840> going<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.170> be

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
initially I thought it was going to be

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.729 
initially I thought it was going to be
big<00:00:59.800> and<00:00:59.829> I<00:01:00.129> thought<00:01:00.309> big<00:01:00.550> meant<00:01:00.870> 600<00:01:01.870> pages<00:01:02.350> or

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
big and I thought big meant 600 pages or

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.280 
big and I thought big meant 600 pages or
so<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.940> turned<00:01:04.150> out<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.479> be<00:01:04.600> twenty<00:01:05.049> four

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
so it turned out to be twenty four

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.899 
so it turned out to be twenty four
hundred<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.680> thirty<00:01:05.950> eight<00:01:06.130> pages<00:01:06.490> across

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.249 
years so in order to create our books we
need<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.979> have<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.159> place<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.820> do<00:01:54.969> it<00:01:55.259> initially

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
need to have a place to do it initially

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.800 
need to have a place to do it initially
that<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:56.649> kitchen<00:01:57.039> in<00:01:57.159> garage<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.719> we

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
that was my kitchen in garage but we

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.420 
that was my kitchen in garage but we
decided<00:01:59.110> pretty<00:01:59.439> quickly<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.100> needed<00:02:00.310> to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
decided pretty quickly that we needed to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.209 
decided pretty quickly that we needed to
build<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:01.000> space<00:02:01.299> where<00:02:01.659> we<00:02:01.689> could<00:02:02.110> really<00:02:02.950> have

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
build a space where we could really have

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.649 
build a space where we could really have
a<00:02:03.250> laboratory<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.119> team<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.539> people

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
a laboratory and a team of people

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.719 
a laboratory and a team of people
working<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.469> and<00:02:05.649> that's<00:02:06.340> what<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
working on it and that's what the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.150 
working on it and that's what the
cooking<00:02:07.000> lab<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.600> here<00:02:08.530> we<00:02:08.650> have<00:02:08.830> very

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
cooking lab is here we have very

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.840 
cooking lab is here we have very
traditional<00:02:09.760> cook

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
traditional cook

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.540 
traditional cook
equipment<00:02:11.300> such<00:02:11.420> as<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.570> wood-burning<00:02:11.960> oven

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
equipment such as a wood-burning oven

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.300 
equipment such as a wood-burning oven
but<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:13.670> also<00:02:13.820> have<00:02:14.210> many<00:02:14.900> high-tech<00:02:15.310> pieces

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
but we also have many high-tech pieces

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.770 
but we also have many high-tech pieces
of<00:02:16.370> equipment<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:17.090> are<00:02:17.120> really<00:02:17.390> only<00:02:17.480> found

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
of equipment that are really only found

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.380 
of equipment that are really only found
in<00:02:17.870> laboratories<00:02:18.880> things<00:02:19.880> like<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> rotary

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
in laboratories things like a rotary

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.020 
in laboratories things like a rotary
evaporator<00:02:20.990> or<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.440> centrifuge<00:02:22.310> or<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> freeze

evaporator or a centrifuge or a freeze
dryer<00:02:23.710> it's<00:02:24.710> this<00:02:24.920> combination<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:26.530> low<00:02:27.530> tech

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
dryer it's this combination of low tech

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.130 
dryer it's this combination of low tech
and<00:02:28.010> high<00:02:28.040> tech<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.820> traditional<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.900> modern

allows us to do research understand how
