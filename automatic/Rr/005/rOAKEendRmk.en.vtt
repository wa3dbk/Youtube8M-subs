00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.189 
recommend just using momentum here it's
not<00:03:53.549> really<00:03:53.819> worth<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.329> my<00:03:54.359> opinion<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.049> use

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
not really worth it in my opinion to use

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.439 
not really worth it in my opinion to use
abilities<00:03:55.669> but<00:03:56.669> one<00:03:56.849> thing<00:03:57.030> i<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.180> recommend

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
abilities but one thing i do recommend

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.119 
abilities but one thing i do recommend
that<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.959> do<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.379> that<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.620> drag<00:03:58.949> your

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
that you do is that you drag your

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.520 
that you do is that you drag your

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
familiar to attack much more quickly and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.020 
familiar to attack much more quickly and
one<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.680> cool<00:04:07.889> things<00:04:07.919> about<00:04:08.310> using

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
one of the cool things about using

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.750 
one of the cool things about using
ranged<00:04:09.690> here<00:04:09.989> at<00:04:10.079> spiritual<00:04:10.530> mages<00:04:10.919> is<00:04:11.129> you

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
ranged here at spiritual mages is you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.339 
ranged here at spiritual mages is you
can<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.150> stay<00:04:12.329> ruin<00:04:12.599> roughly<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.139> same

can just stay ruin roughly the same

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.400 
can just stay ruin roughly the same
position<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.220> stand<00:04:14.760> back<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.269> just<00:04:15.410> range

go and pick up the drops periodically i

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.700 
go and pick up the drops periodically i
don't<00:04:21.570> recommend<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.049> pick<00:04:22.169> up<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.469> runes

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
don't recommend you pick up the runes

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.649 
don't recommend you pick up the runes
though<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.580> not<00:04:23.700> really<00:04:23.909> worth<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.419> much

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
though I so not really worth that much

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.180 
though I so not really worth that much
but<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.950> could<00:04:26.130> be<00:04:26.250> worth<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.610> pick<00:04:26.820> up<00:04:26.940> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
but it could be worth it to pick up the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.400 
but it could be worth it to pick up the
the<00:04:27.730> pure<00:04:27.940> essence<00:04:28.360> as<00:04:28.600> you'll<00:04:29.080> probably

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the pure essence as you'll probably

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.440 
the pure essence as you'll probably
build<00:04:29.710> up<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:30.010> fair<00:04:30.220> bit<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.610> over<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
build up a fair bit of that over the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.200 
build up a fair bit of that over the
course<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.900> task<00:04:32.520> these<00:04:33.520> monsters<00:04:33.910> also

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
course of the task these monsters also

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.750 
course of the task these monsters also
drop<00:04:34.480> dragon<00:04:34.960> boots<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.800> drop<00:04:36.040> rates<00:04:36.310> for

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
drop dragon boots the drop rates for

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.510 
drop dragon boots the drop rates for
them<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:37.060> about<00:04:37.330> 100<00:04:38.040> which<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.220> pretty<00:04:39.400> good

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
them is about 100 which is pretty good

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.000 
them is about 100 which is pretty good
in<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.910> manual<00:04:40.540> probably<00:04:41.140> on<00:04:41.350> average<00:04:41.740> pick

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
in the manual probably on average pick

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.450 
in the manual probably on average pick
up<00:04:42.160> at<00:04:42.340> least<00:04:42.370> one<00:04:42.790> pair<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.180> boots<00:04:43.420> each<00:04:43.720> task

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
up at least one pair of boots each task

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.920 
up at least one pair of boots each task
but<00:04:45.460> they're<00:04:45.940> not<00:04:46.030> really<00:04:46.210> worth<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.750> much

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
but they're not really worth that much

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.870 
but they're not really worth that much
anymore<00:04:47.260> but<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:48.070> just<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.460> little<00:04:48.610> bit<00:04:48.790> of

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
anymore but it is just a little bit of

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.310 
anymore but it is just a little bit of
an<00:04:48.970> extra<00:04:49.270> bonus<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:49.840> guess

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280 

so<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.400> sum<00:04:53.610> up<00:04:53.640> spiritual<00:04:54.600> mages<00:04:54.930> are<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.110> much

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
so to sum up spiritual mages are a much

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.020 
so to sum up spiritual mages are a much
better<00:04:55.560> task<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.250> evolution<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:56.790> combat

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
better task in the evolution of combat

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.500 
better task in the evolution of combat
than<00:04:57.420> they<00:04:57.540> were<00:04:57.720> before<00:04:57.900> hand<00:04:58.440> at<00:04:58.790> 75<00:04:59.790> k<00:05:00.030> XP

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
than they were before hand at 75 k XP

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.630 
than they were before hand at 75 k XP
per<00:05:00.690> hour<00:05:00.810> they're<00:05:01.530> definitely<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.980> fast<00:05:02.280> task

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
per hour they're definitely a fast task

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.850 
per hour they're definitely a fast task
and<00:05:03.120> offer<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.810> added<00:05:04.080> benefit<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.530> the
