here's<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> thing<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> makes<00:00:19.350> life<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.869> theory<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> evolution

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.720 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:23.519> only<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> strong<00:00:24.449> shall<00:00:24.869> survive

maybe<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.090> maybe<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> theory<00:00:31.320> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of
competition<00:00:32.219> says<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.750> they're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.539> math<00:00:55.570> test<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.699> is<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.089> completely

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
isn't a math test this is a completely

so<00:01:07.490> before<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.850> step<00:01:08.240> up<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.750> starting

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
so before you step up to the starting

line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.050 
line before the whistle blows and the

just<00:01:14.960> remember<00:01:15.470> out<00:01:15.680> here<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.119> results<00:01:17.570> don't

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
just remember out here the results don't

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.399 
just remember out here the results don't
always<00:01:17.990> add<00:01:18.320> up
