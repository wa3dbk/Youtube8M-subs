00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.450
 Some years ago it was possible to go further, so I guess who will be around me 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.040
 for example, as real stands for Bernanke can 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.079
 I'll find her around 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:16.070
 WR plays SWE romantically around that's why I've already started 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.769
 that changes too long 2 Pearce I have a what Steinmeier 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.699
 for the way 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.279
 that's really very neat Pierce I find and events always up 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.210
 made the place a name for myself so that it's nice for me 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.710
 Alpbach - already beaten 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.610
 Thank you very much in drive for the drill and then it was 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.190
 make a change 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.670
 At the same time he complained that he had nothing to do with the crime on the 8th 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.900
 therefore, a continuous pinned will continue to strengthen and me 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.640
 keep going 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 and 2 I hope he recognizes it well first 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 maybe now I will see this when the game 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.960
 I would have liked to quickly approach either more you can in the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.730
 Forest 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.110
 or more may sound superficial to my work 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.620
 just do it 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.620
 because they are too long course 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.080
 played with it before so that you can really see step by step 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.180
 it stays summery 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.659
 when the meat became that we left our children half 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 it continues to sing «Satellite» exactly 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 because maybe we really have this game to the end 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 that he had no idea 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 bad then but a little further 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.129
 Forget your favorite coach 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.129
 so then it stuck so long 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 and I still pull it apart a bit 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.269
 because her I like to have a salsa fest 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.269
 the playful ones 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.049
 also so all 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.299
 Karl Lehmann the Zf-gear 11 of a drugstore 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.760
 Processors are supposed to fire the Salacher bit out of the fire 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.729
 makes instructive day 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.659
 he is also the last one I have even at the moment one likes 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 or bought 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.330
 after the 1 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
 Woot the soft nerd ranks 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.409
 say the calculator takes depending on whether planned or brown Harris after 8 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.559
 Second, it has rubber 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 and percent 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 puts the road around 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.089
 So that's the best way 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:22.269
 All that was gone, that was 4 that you do not exist anymore 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.290
 gear 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.750
 Martin Pfarr Euro 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.239
 under par 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.239
 and you have your visa 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.939
 that's how you see it 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.939
 then in the hair I prefer and just binds the whole 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:37.889
 easy 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.209
 what about Rome once 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.209
 that the hall will disappear then 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.929
 do you need 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.549
 such 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.940
 Tension also lives with MdL or Thomas Baral from whatever you are 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.449
 has reached 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.639
 just pin it up 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 one that the Horber 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.699
 be made 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.389
 they are the only real need 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.009
 so you can do that too 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.149
 depending on whether we want to have a little more apartments here 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.039
 around 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.090
 he would have to put the tighter it is tighter and that's just why it is 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.349
 This has to go to them 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.150
 and sometimes I make sure that it's cool outside 

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.930
 then my uncle Oppenheim also looks very pretty 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.620
 especially if the wm-broke, I can understand it now too 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.080
 worse 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.509
 so 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.129
 therefore it is considered as established 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.489
 As I said, it really does not have to be 100% percent right now 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.479
 from the individual 1 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.099
 pretty colorful jogger all profiles 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.610
 have been done 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.849
 maybe every year for the four-door Lenzen bit loose everything 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:58.479
 out 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.889
 Lehner with a poem 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.759
 who has braided her before 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.759
 and capture the Emma Thomas pole 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.180
 would 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.180
 and that may only be over snow now 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.219
 also calls you through with relaxation 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.219
 or way 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.110
 Forget Spittal Game 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.430
 verdi-chef the steps so I find them myself he stands out, too 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.190
 When I go to work, I think Thurau Warcraft is right there 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.750
 you have to decide for yourself Feck I saw a short time from the back of the 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.750
 page 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.400
 Wolff Ahlen 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.940
 Nikolaus I know I have a player little things now nothing 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.479
 around 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.740
 simply because of course if you still have a playground in the country 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.529
 and there is also what she makes of them so so as to said rather cool 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.569
 next, Merkel will surely meet for five minutes 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.999
 then the earlier comparisons I hope you like us and I wish 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:09.439
 give them a nice day TSV
