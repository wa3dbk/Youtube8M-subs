tiens allow you to jump off the system

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.040 
tiens allow you to jump off the system
and<00:00:36.309> make<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.550> larger<00:00:37.030> system<00:00:37.300> we'll<00:00:37.780> talk

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
and make a larger system we'll talk

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.919 
and make a larger system we'll talk
about<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.499> more<00:00:38.710> in<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.890> second<00:00:39.659> here<00:00:40.659> we<00:00:40.809> have

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
about that more in a second here we have

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.169 
about that more in a second here we have
a<00:00:40.960> zip<00:00:41.739> tie<00:00:41.979> we'll<00:00:42.219> talk<00:00:42.429> more<00:00:42.640> about<00:00:42.699> that<00:00:43.030> in

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
a zip tie we'll talk more about that in

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.719 
a zip tie we'll talk more about that in
a<00:00:43.239> second<00:00:43.629> this<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.800> tool<00:00:45.010> for<00:00:45.039> poking

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
a second this is the tool for poking

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.549 
a second this is the tool for poking
holes<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.710> allows<00:00:47.979> you<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.219> poke<00:00:48.429> a<00:00:48.460> hole

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
holes this allows you to poke a hole

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.319 
holes this allows you to poke a hole
place<00:00:50.559> one<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.249> these<00:00:51.370> or<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:51.940> allow<00:00:52.179> it<00:00:52.210> to

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
place one of these or just allow it to

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.700 
place one of these or just allow it to
drain<00:00:52.629> right<00:00:52.839> through<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.170> hole<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.620> little

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
drain right through the hole a little

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.229 
drain right through the hole a little
bit<00:00:53.949> further<00:00:54.219> down<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.549> system<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.089> take<00:00:55.210> a

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
bit further down the system and take a

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.649 
bit further down the system and take a
look<00:00:56.519> as<00:00:57.519> we<00:00:57.699> get<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.059> site<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.510> see

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
look as we get to this site you see

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.139 
look as we get to this site you see
we've<00:00:58.780> got<00:00:58.809> an<00:00:59.049> irrigation<00:00:59.589> whole<00:00:59.769> setup<00:01:00.149> this

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
we've got an irrigation whole setup this

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.059 
we've got an irrigation whole setup this
is<00:01:01.359> hooked<00:01:01.600> with<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:01.959> tool<00:01:02.260> it's<00:01:02.709> as<00:01:02.889> simple

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
is hooked with this tool it's as simple

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.139 
is hooked with this tool it's as simple
as<00:01:03.690> pressing<00:01:04.690> it<00:01:04.960> in<00:01:05.080> there<00:01:05.290> put<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.460> back<00:01:06.640> down

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
as pressing it in there put it back down

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.020 
as pressing it in there put it back down
it<00:01:07.240> won't<00:01:07.450> go<00:01:07.600> too<00:01:07.659> deep<00:01:08.520> won't<00:01:09.520> poke<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.880> on

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
it won't go too deep won't poke you on

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060 
it won't go too deep won't poke you on
the<00:01:10.119> other<00:01:10.240> side<00:01:10.570> now<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.740> set<00:01:11.950> up

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
the other side now you can set up

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.529 
the other side now you can set up
something<00:01:12.280> like<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:12.789> if<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.119> wanted<00:01:13.360> to

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
something like this if you wanted to

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.749 
something like this if you wanted to
this<00:01:13.780> just<00:01:14.049> presses<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.159> hole<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.490> just

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
this just presses in the hole you just

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.529 
this just presses in the hole you just
made<00:01:17.250> we've<00:01:18.250> got<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.399> little<00:01:18.579> sprinkler<00:01:19.090> tip<00:01:19.329> on

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
made we've got a little sprinkler tip on

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.679 
made we've got a little sprinkler tip on
here<00:01:19.869> maybe<00:01:20.109> you<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.409> see<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.859> it's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
here maybe you can see that it's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.480 
here maybe you can see that it's
draining<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.869> little<00:01:23.109> softer<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> way<00:01:24.039> not

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
draining a little softer this way not

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.539 
draining a little softer this way not
quite<00:01:24.729> as<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:26.590> erosion<00:01:27.159> with<00:01:27.340> this

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
quite as a much erosion with this

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.580 
quite as a much erosion with this
particular<00:01:28.240> one<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.719> also<00:01:28.869> has<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> valve

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
particular one and it also has a valve

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.950 
particular one and it also has a valve
so<00:01:30.009> if<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.280> wanted<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.640> slow<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.659> flow<00:01:31.689> down

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
so if you wanted to slow the flow down

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.109 
so if you wanted to slow the flow down
or<00:01:32.649> maybe<00:01:32.799> shut<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.219> off<00:01:33.340> completely<00:01:33.969> you

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
or maybe shut it off completely you

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
or maybe shut it off completely you
could<00:01:34.560> let's<00:01:35.560> go<00:01:35.710> further<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> line

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
could let's go further down the line

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.870 
could let's go further down the line
come<00:01:39.310> down<00:01:39.520> here

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
come down here

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.370 
come down here
where<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:43.030> reach<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.420> t-connector<00:01:44.109> in<00:01:44.259> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
where we reach a t-connector in the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.779 
where we reach a t-connector in the
system<00:01:44.829> here<00:01:45.789> we've<00:01:46.000> got<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.270> another<00:01:47.490> pin<00:01:48.490> hole

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
system here we've got a another pin hole

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.149 
system here we've got a another pin hole
set<00:01:49.359> up<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.630> irrigate<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.380> could<00:01:50.590> be<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:50.920> any

plant tree whatever you've got right now

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.859 
plant tree whatever you've got right now
we're<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:53.710> watering<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.219> grass<00:01:54.869> this

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
we're just watering the grass this

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.830 
we're just watering the grass this
