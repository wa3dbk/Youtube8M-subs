00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.740
 when talking about cars like the 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.200
 aventador lamborghini really are 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.540
 many things we would like to tell you or 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.640
 maybe we could even shut up 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.360
 talk pictures and let them sing 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.040
 sub 12 as only e is able to do 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.079
 but we also want to tell you about the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.660
 his line a concentrate of malice 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.800
 unparalleled simply to be removed 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.750
 the breath 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.670
 and so bad that when you look at it 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.380
 it almost puts fear even because of the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.050
 dimensions are important with the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.570
 length of 4.78 meters and width 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.679
 which exceeds 2 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.109
 then we want to talk about the very great 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.940
 protagonist who makes a fine show of himself 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.609
 through the transparent engine hood 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.309
 so they seem put on display the 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.079
 v12 of sant'agata is a masterpiece of 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.059
 mechanical engineering capable of 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.989
 develop the amazing power of 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 700 horses 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.180
 he is also capable of reaching the hundred 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.610
 kilometers per hour in shock time of 2.9 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 seconds but equally exaggerated and the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.300
 top speed 350 kilometers per hour 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.370
 but the aventador is not just a motor 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.440
 performance because also from the point of 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.780
 technical view is a true masterpiece 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
 the frame is a monocoque entirely in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.410
 carbon fiber with the cell 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.510
 of the passenger compartment and the roof they make 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.130
 part of the only structure 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.229
 this guarantees rigidity 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.740
 torsional never seen before 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.869
 but not just the whole frame weighs just 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.850
 229 kg and moreover there are also the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.320
 very sophisticated pushrod suspensions 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.360
 just like those of formula 1 to 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.369
 driving exceeded initial disturbance 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 when you start pushing the traction 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.460
 whole wheat 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.460
 despite the exaggerated power allows 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.930
 to eliminate skating altogether 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.670
 while cornering due to the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.680
 frame kush rod suppressions 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.720
 monocoque you perceive a sense of 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.450
 direct dialogue link between 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.659
 arms the steering wheel the wheels and the asphalt 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.209
 never seen before 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.340
 the isr gearbox although not a double 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.100
 clutch ensures speed in the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.709
 really crazy gear shifts 50 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.920
 truly phenomenal thousandths of a second 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.390
 also the four carbon-ceramic discs 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.390
 simply insensitive to fatigue 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.590
 we do n't have the car's limits 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.689
 reached and we don't even know if 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 they exist is much easier to reach 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.549
 first those of man than of the means 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.379
 so it may seem strange but 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.870
 the aventador also with electronics 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.879
 unplugged at least on a track not 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.220
 too fast as that of the castle 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.700
 turns out to be incredibly easy to 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.920
 to drive 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.769
 practically within reach of any 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.420
 sheikh or wealthy footballer like that 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.379
 does not risk crashing into the first one 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.420
 curve 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.510
 we emphasize wealthy why 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.519
 the aventador costs the beauty of 326 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.920
 thousand 700 euro customizations excluded 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.150
 despite its stellar price though 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.560
 allow us to feel a little proud 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.540
 national 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.739
 but how good are we Italians at 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.739
 build the super car
