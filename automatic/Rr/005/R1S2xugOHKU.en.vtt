octane<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> do

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
octane but basically you just want to do

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
octane but basically you just want to do
the<00:00:32.820> basic<00:00:33.239> glitch<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> grenade

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the basic glitch now with the grenade

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
the basic glitch now with the grenade
launcher<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> bit<00:00:35.700> different<00:00:35.880> than<00:00:36.090> in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
launcher it is a bit different than in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
launcher it is a bit different than in
the<00:00:37.020> normal<00:00:37.200> glitch<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.610> two

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the normal glitch because the two

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
the normal glitch because the two
buttons<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.570> switched<00:00:40.110> around

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
buttons are switched around

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
buttons are switched around
so<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> button<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> were<00:00:41.670> normally

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
so the button that you were normally

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
so the button that you were normally
pressed<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> shotgun

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
pressed to go over to the shotgun

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
pressed to go over to the shotgun
attachment<00:00:44.309> when<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
attachment when you do it with the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.590 
attachment when you do it with the
shotgun<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.309> actually<00:00:47.640> pulling<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
shotgun you are actually pulling out the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
shotgun you are actually pulling out the
trophy<00:00:48.960> system<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
trophy system on this one so you have to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729 
trophy system on this one so you have to
mix<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.870> buttons<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.440> I'll<00:00:52.590> leave

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.530 
up to anything that allows you to climb
up<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> button<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
up that doesn't have the a button or the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.749 
up that doesn't have the a button or the
the<00:01:27.540> X<00:01:27.780> button<00:01:28.080> showing<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.680> climb<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the X button showing to climb up so I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
the X button showing to climb up so I
went<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.329> bus<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
went up to this bus right here that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
went up to this bus right here that
basically<00:01:31.829> allows<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> climb<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.909> without
