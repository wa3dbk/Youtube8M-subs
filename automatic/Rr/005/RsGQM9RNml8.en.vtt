00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.559
 [Music] 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.260
 illustrious young people were very 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.150
 excited 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 the three players 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.740
 we are like horacio nava that all the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.740
 50 states 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:40.460
 the most obvious that you reason 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:43.340
 1 but quickly a survey in 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.390
 twitter could be interim president 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.060
 where from mexico decisions 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.550
 we are then ports yes but it is 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.090
 important because most of the majority 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.090
 peralta already crown 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.810
 50-50 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.259
 as well as closed the 100 meters 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.630
 planes as bolt appears scene from the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.670
 dinacia seem very hard because 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.280
 I think he sees it serene to sell 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.140
 quiet laundry well the reservation and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.310
 is going to be friend calderón is going to embrace the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.610
 breakfast 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.110
 and then at the end they proposed and hiram 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.119
 They also knew it very well that 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.250
 it could be but it was very young it was missing 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.770
 little but good so are the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.259
 polls but hey he was even 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.920
 Weeping Sanchez already said that he cried 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.960
 later because the toner 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 [Laughs] 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.670
 but we have doubts after what 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.009
 he tweeted two things because he won 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.429
 then mexico will be better brazil because 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.440
 won according to the logic of the king pelé by 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.810
 why why did he give accounts because 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.049
 it's classic because Mexico like the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.759
 world of the goalkeeper is crown was that was 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:09.009
 the one who did the same paradons endured 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.009
 Then because it gives more to fuck Avila 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.750
 because you did not come wretched scoundrel da 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.940
 more for fuck what for fuck the foral 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.920
 so can this be a curtain of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.660
 smoke because they grabbed a PRIist 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.450
 approaching that all facebook 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.700
 with several distinguished tricolor 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.360
 they grabbed him with the cousin of the chat 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.890
 it's for the value of the match 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.019
 yes clear a confusion also confused 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.019
 in congratulated alex lora 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:53.140
 also because well that's what the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:53.140
 the very same distinguished Basque 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:08.319
 because to annoy also the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:16.690
 insulin mister ocampo mexico 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.690
 the attitude of the neck is important 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.960
 and well finally at the beginning 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.310
 idea because they were 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.700
 gold three silver and two bronze 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.620
 I am 132 and in the end to break this 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.330
 this thing that is not politically 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.290
 correct since they already won the other one 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.190
 bronze 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.190
 it's already broken 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.630
 until now everything is the fault of pal 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:59.009
 goal when I nani the angels 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.009
 [Music] 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.030
