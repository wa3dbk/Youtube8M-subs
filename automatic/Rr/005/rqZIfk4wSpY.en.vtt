00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.019
 three goals were many for an encounter in which the 

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.460
 areas with little vocation 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.220
 and in which the little game that was seen 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.299
 it was more the product of the will to play than of anything else in lines 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.019
 general zaragoza was superior to albacete 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 driven by country on all with the complement of 15 and 10 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.539
 it was from the minute 20 of the first part when the Aragonese 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.519
 decided to take the initiative in view of the fact that those at home could not find 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.239
 no line of action that effective 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.219
 However, that domain did not translate into really dangerous plays for 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.060
 balaguer 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.329
 and as cedrún barely had work in this first part 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.620
 on the first occasion that he was presented to the albacete to leave quickly 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.360
 on counterattack minute 29 belsué cut the career of chemist 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.860
 a foul that cost him the yellow card 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.960
 the zaragoza recovered neither that active and three minutes later in the 32 fig tree and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.490
 esnáider 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.710
 in the middle of the field 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 they sent the combination that allowed the inspired country 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.130
 beat balaguer on his way out 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.690
 while it was the fruit of good work they are autistic on the middle zone of the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.970
 albacete where aragón fig tree is an idea 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.820
 they worked quite freely in front of a medullary manchega where 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.650
 Salazar could not impose his presence 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 until the end of the first time the dawn zepeda code to that of the match with 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 throws from far 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.120
 in which salazar stood out 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.040
 asparagus replaced the saints by antonio at rest and later at 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.990
 mixon by ramón view of the life of both but the key to albacete was 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.050
 in the greater activity of salazar in the second time 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.410
 at five minutes salazar took advantage of a lack 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.910
 and the zambombazo of this fund his gender slipped into the goal of surprised zeng 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.820
 once again 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 for the expertise of the South American 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.799
 the tie arrived very soon so it opened the hopes of a female 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.020
 more showy but it was not so just an arrival of iker to pass of pardeza a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 minute later it was worth mentioning throughout the second part 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.890
 by zaragoza nor albacete did anything otherworldly nides had to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.180
 wait until the 39th minute to see a shot of one of sine 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 at the exit of a corner Ramón headed a center shot 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.309
 but the final blow came three minutes later in 42 when in 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.819
 a little bit thrown towards and the one that delayed the ball and menéndez 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.049
 topped hard 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.069
 in the rest a pure misfortune for zaragoza cáceres diverted in balloons 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 you did not know how to resolve the ballot 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.629
 pardeza and aragon claimed out of positional game of evident antonio 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.559
 but without consequences for the referee passes slowly did not hesitate to grant so 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.559
 unusual 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.760
 from there to the end nothing that was not the comment of the play he threw 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.259
 land the meritorious work of the Aragonese 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.749
 but those who should have thought about it is the effort and tension of the 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.119
 Wednesday in Seville 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.119
 Peru and logical inspiration to the second have left 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.740
 I did not do it since the first quarter started since the market 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.430
 doctors and sincerely what it is that says a lot there was then to think about what 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.759
 the ball was going with I want out the wind roló retired then go the pot but 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.919
 sincerely sudan

 is approved in Caracas 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.159
 monge reasoned 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.650
 the Bolivians no matter how much you feel sorry for the producer sacrifice of the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.309
 companions by the number position by rye and even when these 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.689
