their<00:00:59.160> molecular<00:00:59.489> size<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.329> small<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
their molecular size is really small you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
their molecular size is really small you
can<00:01:00.840> find<00:01:01.079> nanotechnology<00:01:01.980> peptides<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
can find nanotechnology peptides you can

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.280 
can find nanotechnology peptides you can
basically<00:01:02.789> find<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> alternatives<00:01:04.199> that

skin care she says people should be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.890 
skin care she says people should be
aware<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> what's<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.360> their<00:01:15.600> skin

aware of what's going on their skin

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.630 
aware of what's going on their skin
because<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.530> days<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.100> molecular

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because these days the molecular

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
because these days the molecular
structure<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> products<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.409> small<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
structure of products is so small that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
structure of products is so small that
synthetic<00:01:20.340> chemicals<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.270> easily<00:01:21.659> absorbed

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
synthetic chemicals are easily absorbed

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
synthetic chemicals are easily absorbed
into<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> skin<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.100> unlike<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> eat

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
into the skin and unlike what we eat

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
into the skin and unlike what we eat
which<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.720> detoxified<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:25.890> liver<00:01:26.159> these

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
which is detoxified by our liver these

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.390 
which is detoxified by our liver these
go<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:27.689> our<00:01:27.900> bloodstream<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.860> some

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
go right into our bloodstream and some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
go right into our bloodstream and some
are<00:01:29.640> linked<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> health<00:01:30.180> problems

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
are linked to health problems

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.020 
are linked to health problems
so<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> key<00:01:31.500> offenders<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.280> parabens<00:01:32.850> which

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so the key offenders are parabens which

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
so the key offenders are parabens which
a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:33.920> also<00:01:34.920> pegs<00:01:35.280> PE

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a lot of people know about also pegs PE

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.359 
a lot of people know about also pegs PE
