00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
have the top layer of the cake so let's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.999 
have the top layer of the cake so let's
just<00:01:20.130> layer<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.990> section<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.890> I'm

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
just layer that section and then I'm

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.270 
just layer that section and then I'm
gonna<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> signal<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> guy

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.500 
simple but super powerful okay but for
this<00:01:43.470> type<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> sound<00:01:44.190> I<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.970> square

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
this type of sound I just want a square

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.880 
this type of sound I just want a square
wave<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:46.170> called<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> pulse<00:01:46.710> wave<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:48.890> let's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
wave also called a pulse wave and let's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:06.620 
wave also called a pulse wave and let's
get<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.160> note<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.640> first<00:02:04.130> okay<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:06.330> now

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
get the note right first okay so now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.070 
get the note right first okay so now
we've<00:02:07.020> got<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.970> wave<00:02:08.970> form<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.600> course<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.929> have

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
we've got the wave form of course I have

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.250 
we've got the wave form of course I have
the<00:02:10.229> sustain<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:11.840> we're<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> keep<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the sustain off we're going to keep it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.780 
the sustain off we're going to keep it
that<00:02:13.350> way<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.820> make<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.239> short<00:02:15.510> but

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that way to make it really short but

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.990 
that way to make it really short but
so<00:02:17.450> now<00:02:17.659> we<00:02:17.720> need<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.959> basically<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.950> pull<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
so now we need to basically in pull the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.490 
so now we need to basically in pull the
filter<00:02:20.390> down<00:02:20.569> here<00:02:22.120> filter<00:02:23.349> envelope<00:02:24.349> amount

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
filter down here filter envelope amount

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:39.670 
filter down here filter envelope amount
down<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> bit

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.430 

okay<00:02:40.680> let's<00:02:40.920> record<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.460> real<00:02:41.700> quick<00:02:42.440> it's

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
okay let's record that real quick it's

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.090 
okay let's record that real quick it's
audio<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:46.130> then<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.370> wanted<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.820> try<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.180> well

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
audio and then I wanted to try as well

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
having a little bit of a pitch envelope

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.420 
having a little bit of a pitch envelope
on<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> front<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.960> did<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.190> synth

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
on the front of that did this this synth

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400 
on the front of that did this this synth
is<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:53.820> crazy<00:02:54.030> actually<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.600> has<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
patch Bay on the side which is really

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.740 
patch Bay on the side which is really
rare<00:02:58.380> for<00:02:58.410> such<00:02:58.710> an<00:02:58.860> affordable<00:02:59.750> little

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
little unit a little package so we're

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.000 
little unit a little package so we're
gonna<00:03:04.140> say<00:03:05.390> VCF<00:03:06.390> mod<00:03:06.840> maybe<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.410> has<00:03:09.830> ug<00:03:10.830> yep

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
gonna say VCF mod maybe it has ug yep

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
gonna say VCF mod maybe it has ug yep
that's<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.460> want

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.349 

there<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.049> go<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.920> was<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.250> ticket<00:03:30.459> okay<00:03:31.299> so

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
there we go that was the ticket okay so

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.649 
there we go that was the ticket okay so
basically<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.260> put<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.879> filter<00:03:33.879> envelope<00:03:34.090> on

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
basically I put the filter envelope on

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.770 
basically I put the filter envelope on
to<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.639> on<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:38.099> oscillator<00:03:39.099> pitch<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
to the on to the oscillator pitch and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.539 
to the on to the oscillator pitch and
it's<00:03:40.959> also<00:03:41.170> doing<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.889> envelope<00:03:42.310> on<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
it's also doing the envelope on the

00:03:42.549 --> 00:04:02.280 
it's also doing the envelope on the
filter<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:57.519> or<00:03:57.909> that<00:03:58.180> one<00:04:00.629> alright<00:04:01.629> so<00:04:01.780> got<00:04:02.139> our

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
filter so or that one alright so got our

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.879 
filter so or that one alright so got our
two<00:04:02.439> kicks<00:04:04.139> basically<00:04:05.139> my<00:04:05.290> set<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.650> guy<00:04:05.829> to

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
two kicks basically my set this guy to

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.050 
two kicks basically my set this guy to
the<00:04:06.069> side<00:04:06.310> now<00:04:06.519> get<00:04:07.389> in<00:04:07.510> here<00:04:07.719> in<00:04:07.870> Ableton<00:04:08.409> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
the side now get in here in Ableton and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.720 
the side now get in here in Ableton and
let's<00:04:10.060> put<00:04:10.299> this<00:04:10.389> on<00:04:10.569> monitor<00:04:10.959> Auto<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:12.609> then

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
let's put this on monitor Auto and then

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.469 
let's put this on monitor Auto and then
we're<00:04:12.939> gonna<00:04:13.030> drop<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:14.530> sample<00:04:15.099> into<00:04:15.730> a

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
we're gonna drop this sample into a

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.659 
we're gonna drop this sample into a
simpler<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.769> just<00:04:17.949> made<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.159> new<00:04:18.340> MIDI<00:04:18.579> track

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
simpler so I just made a new MIDI track

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.390 
simpler so I just made a new MIDI track
there<00:04:19.180> Apple<00:04:19.840> shifty<00:04:22.949> click<00:04:23.949> on<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.190> MIDI

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
there Apple shifty click on that MIDI

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.159 
there Apple shifty click on that MIDI
track<00:04:24.729> pull<00:04:25.449> in<00:04:25.599> our<00:04:25.690> sample<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.840> I'm<00:04:29.020> going

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
track pull in our sample and I'm going

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.320 
track pull in our sample and I'm going
to<00:04:29.199> add<00:04:29.349> my<00:04:29.560> pattern<00:04:29.979> that<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.220> want<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.270> it

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
to add my pattern that I want so it

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:55.550 
to add my pattern that I want so it
should<00:04:34.510> be<00:04:34.539> see

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.190 

there's<00:04:56.560> our<00:04:56.740> loop<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:01.210> then<00:05:01.900> let's<00:05:02.110> check

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
there's our loop and then let's check

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.890 
there's our loop and then let's check
out<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.770> sample<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.510> tune<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.660> if<00:05:04.750> we<00:05:04.870> need

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
out this sample and tune it if we need

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.890 
out this sample and tune it if we need
to<00:05:09.150> make<00:05:10.150> sure<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.480> just<00:05:10.630> one<00:05:10.930> voice<00:05:12.900> now

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
to make sure it's just one voice now

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.560 
to make sure it's just one voice now
since<00:05:14.170> we<00:05:14.380> have<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:15.130> other<00:05:15.520> kick<00:05:15.850> layered<00:05:16.210> in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
since we have the other kick layered in

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.390 
since we have the other kick layered in
there<00:05:16.600> I'm<00:05:17.350> actually<00:05:17.500> gonna<00:05:17.770> take<00:05:18.040> off<00:05:18.220> the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
there I'm actually gonna take off the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.260 
there I'm actually gonna take off the
attack<00:05:18.790> right<00:05:19.060> here<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:21.820> brings<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.180> a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
attack right here so it just brings in a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:31.320 
attack right here so it just brings in a
bit<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.570> tail<00:05:22.810> solo<00:05:23.770> with<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.040> drums<00:05:30.330> and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
bit of a tail solo with the drums and

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.640 
bit of a tail solo with the drums and
you<00:05:31.450> can<00:05:31.600> see<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.960> did<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.290> really<00:05:32.500> nice

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
you can see that I did a really nice

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.390 
you can see that I did a really nice
characteristic<00:05:33.610> sort<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.500> analog<00:05:35.500> warmth<00:05:36.040> to

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
characteristic sort of analog warmth to

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.970 
characteristic sort of analog warmth to
the<00:05:36.550> base<00:05:36.730> of<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.030> kick<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.380> system<00:05:38.860> in

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
the base of the kick and the system in

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:49.230 
the base of the kick and the system in
the<00:05:39.070> context<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.610> song<00:05:39.760> though<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:49.090> then

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
the context of the song though and then

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.070 
the context of the song though and then
maybe<00:05:49.420> just<00:05:49.480> for<00:05:51.060> fun<00:05:52.060> let's<00:05:52.090> try<00:05:52.390> adding<00:05:52.780> this

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
maybe just for fun let's try adding this

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.320 
maybe just for fun let's try adding this
kick<00:05:53.350> in<00:05:53.530> just<00:05:53.560> as<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:53.950> Audio<00:05:55.530> unmoor<00:05:56.530> pit<00:05:57.330> drag

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
kick in just as a Audio unmoor pit drag

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:07.820 
kick in just as a Audio unmoor pit drag
this<00:05:58.510> front

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:24.090 

this<00:06:08.830> will<00:06:09.220> reverse<00:06:22.260> so<00:06:23.260> there<00:06:23.440> that's<00:06:23.650> pretty

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
this will reverse so there that's pretty

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.650 
this will reverse so there that's pretty
much<00:06:24.340> all<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:24.640> wanted<00:06:24.760> to<00:06:25.000> do<00:06:25.180> just<00:06:25.420> sort<00:06:25.540> of

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
show you the the beat as it goes there's

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.750
