00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.720
 McDonald's plans to stay open during the Christmas day it's not 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.800
 Their employees offer no extra work to work on Christmas Day but no 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.759
 That's it 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.549
 Bill O'Reilly 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.820
 Santa Clause 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.369
 Well wall 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.820
 In Christmas let me forget happy holidays forget to know that holiday 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.619
 Treat 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.390
 They are to them if you know the work you doubt Idaho Christmas 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 Every week tries with their families and almost change the salon only 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.850
 I'm sure Bill Riley is attacking McDonalds 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 as we speak 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.690
 Big sister can be that Bill O'Reilly it will not match s 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.009
 Not just in a word 

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:48.830
 Do not give them over time 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.960
 This is a matter of disobeying Jesus 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.810
 The justification for this is care 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.960
 To work on that day in volunteer work as with today 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.489
 Through the way that I am not 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.879
 High-paid f_ me I do not think okay 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.809
 Because of her 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.960
 Volunteered on Christmas Day who was killed on Christmas Day work 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 You do not get updated crash data 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.140
 You do not really have a Christmas present basically in this country at this stage 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.630
 The right secular holiday like I know secular origins are not currently not 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 My absolute volunteering for this patent is two things 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.480
 Or one that's how to do it always love 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.470
 Well I mean when there is no file regulations or person wages 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 Volunteer to work up 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490
 I think the DATS worked well i did not make this twelve hour work 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.960
 Volunteering to work twelve hours a day will barter sixteen hours at work 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 The day that eight-year-old volunteers to work in months what I did not make 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450
 One in the house outside it dragged out 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.130
 And that's why you need laws and regulations to make sure they are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 Do not get away from that 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.520
 The semi-voluntary is also Senator Robert 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.549
 Those are uh 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.340
 Bennett co-workers s_n_p_ Hain MIT Romney is the reference image 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.040
 Because 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.750
 There to watch you know 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.200
 Do Romney MIT, so I wonder when you know more tax and less regulation 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.480
 So that he would not have safety systems for exactly the same workers 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.670
 Then when he blessed them that they made the men leave work 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.689
 Reduce their salaries paid them 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.309
 Its a very big deal 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.939
 That diet this year is one on a radio 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:25.959
 in a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.919
 We did not go making it mandatory just had 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.889
 The node that will be in the definition make it before 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:35.819
 good 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.749
 Against this version is 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.659
 Ieded Greg under their heads I'm just about the fire I expected then I 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.089
 They are not forced to buy these employees to work and they do not get overtime 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.709
 It is most rediculously and how can we possibly be 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.549
 No amount of profit 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.329
 That McDonalds makes ENDL 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.959
 Little small amount is paid to its employees 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.189
 There's one sorry we did not get to this week earlier there was a sparkle 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.759
 old 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.219
 It was a delightful glimpse of the front page of the Huffington Post 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.309
 He worked for the Ford Company for McDonald's thirty years okay 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.609
 And now you are how much they paid their salaries thirty years later a little over eight 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.849
 Dollars 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.509
 Eight dollars is fine 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.349
 Talk about each company's own point point and let them make it out now 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.860
 Which need to organize it 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.939
 It's trivial they make this kind of profit and their pain 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.239
 In their employees they are pro staff little pressure up u_s_ 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.289
 How they may have been received 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:33.079
 In answer to this rich purple in her 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.159
 Because she 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.680
 In the legal responsibility and credit responsibility to squeeze each one 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.189
 Red shark 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.609
 To its shareholders 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.429
 So we should be surprised that it should not be like all the reasons turned out 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.969
 That way they can repay all I got and show that I will not work for Chrysler 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.259
 Saying something out there knows what it means so when it comes out with 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.159
 My personal concern is 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.219
 The amazing legal responsibility is to do everything in its power to one penny 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.079
 A personal friend of mine spent twenty-five years of McDonald's 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.639
 He had bad luck likely to go to college and he lost one of his legs to cancer and he had 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.759
 I worked there for twenty-five years 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.779
 And the first week that air 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.799
 They gave him a special reward 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.470
 $ 25 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.979
 Now our region we do not think is conflicting 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.759
 Armin seeks the Christmas artist ... uh all of you guys are volunteering to work 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.939
 The hardest shoppers respect sorry 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.149
 Is mandatory 

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.840
 Author cut 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.710
 Water is pretty much all the details of this error 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.750
 The 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.610
 EBay 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.039
 Now its parts are original records that I did not arnelle 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.490
 Now they've always said 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.660
 I mean it is not working finished 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.250
 My belief or July is happily believed 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.669
 Before Christmas and a half of it 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.069
 Saturday 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.120
 WordPress is that every year 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.220
 Nisha how to get back to work
