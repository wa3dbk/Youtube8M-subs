here we had your restructure because we
have<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.299> old<00:01:30.600> oven<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> microwave

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
have the old oven we have the microwave

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.649 
have the old oven we have the microwave
and<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.820> new<00:01:32.939> doors<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.420> had<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and we put new doors so we had to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.149 
and we put new doors so we had to
restructure<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.619> everything

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
restructure all this because everything

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
restructure all this because everything
is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> different<00:01:35.579> size<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is a different size so you can see the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
is a different size so you can see the
changes<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.759> we're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
