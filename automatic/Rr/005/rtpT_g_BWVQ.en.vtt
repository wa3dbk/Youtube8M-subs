00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:20.369
 my'll just let us now change the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.500
 connector of the s2 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.779
 9.100 connector is all conjugated a flex 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.420
 will the data load connector goes to a 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 Microphone is all plugged in flex and up 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.719
 has antenna 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.380
 so come on, there is not much secret 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380
 on here 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.359
 come on the first thing is procedure 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.320
 normal 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:01:02.289
 it is composed of 2 467 screw here is 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.289
 remove them from the bottom of the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:27.530
 it's risky 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:50.230
 The second step is to deactivate the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.230
 now to remove the back cover 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.240
 You have to be very careful with the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.899
 flex 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:11.550
 this device our season lasts with 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.550
 the flex time apparatus 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 he has an astral is so is normal 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.910
 that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 and that that backside will have to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.690
 be removed 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.990
 this is the flex what we are going 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.330
 die 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:49.610
 so here is the end on two screws 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:54.140
 here at the foot of the flex and here and there 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.040
 We have to remove the antenna here and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.950
 here is a flex too and has a 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.870
 screw here it's good we people 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 repeat here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.430
 to lift the main plate to 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.400
 power because this flex is passed by 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.709
 below is more a reflection of the good here 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.050
 Wee also melted 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.270
 avoid a problem and here you can 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.970
 stand up just a little bit so he's by 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:28.910
 low 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:30.610
 You're ready to go, just put the new one. 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.810
 equipment 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.810
 he will put it down here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:54.079
 fit it right local microphone it 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.239
 there is a beam and here the good in that 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.459
 that he has a trading 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.470
 you better put me down here that 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.860
 lock has a very high staff then no 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.750
 It is good strength to later 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.359
 other 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:18.109
 now just redo the procedure 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:22.419
 put the normal glasses are two 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.419
 screws as you have seen 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.970
 ready when the company connect antenna 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.650
 again you can not forget there's another one 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.940
 screw that we removed in the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.960
 main plate of the appliance here 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.960
 on the flex side 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.760
 then you reclosed the two flex intel flex 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.460
 It's what kicks here that is the own 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.740
 charging connector and do not place the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.070
 now let's put a back 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.650
 new has the buttons people can not 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.120
 Forgetting that it falls usually falls 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.570
 time to seal the appliance you have to take 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.570
 quite careful 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.960
 when tightening also tightens well 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.400
 because if you put 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.030
 pressing the dangerous medium is to give 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:44.960
 a problem with a toad or the LCD and 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:47.080
 Even now there are only houses to escape. 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.080
 again 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:17.370
 Good people, this is it, there is not much more 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.670
 what to speak now not only creating 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.850
 procedure completed until the 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.850
 next
