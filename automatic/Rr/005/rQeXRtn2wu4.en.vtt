one thing that I notice a lot with a lot

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.470 
one thing that I notice a lot with a lot
of<00:00:16.439> players<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.099> they<00:00:17.310> tend<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> play<00:00:17.939> too<00:00:18.000> many

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of players is they tend to play too many

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.749 
of players is they tend to play too many
route<00:00:18.840> notes<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.890> understandable<00:00:20.489> when<00:00:20.699> you

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
route notes it's understandable when you

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.130 
route notes it's understandable when you
practice<00:00:21.089> your<00:00:21.239> scales<00:00:21.509> and<00:00:21.749> your<00:00:21.869> different

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
practice your scales and your different

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
practice your scales and your different
things<00:00:22.349> you're<00:00:22.859> gonna<00:00:22.980> start<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.489> the<00:00:23.550> root

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
things you're gonna start from the root

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.729 
things you're gonna start from the root
note<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.329> that's<00:00:24.599> why<00:00:24.749> we<00:00:24.869> tend<00:00:25.079> to<00:00:25.140> finish<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
note so that's why we tend to finish and

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.919 
note so that's why we tend to finish and
start<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.189> root<00:00:26.399> notes<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.909> all<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
start on root notes and do all of that

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:28.819 
start on root notes and do all of that
sort<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> stuff

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
sort of stuff

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.929 
sort of stuff
now<00:00:28.979> there's<00:00:29.220> nothing<00:00:29.489> wrong<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.759> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
now there's nothing wrong with that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.359 
now there's nothing wrong with that
nothing<00:00:30.689> wrong<00:00:30.839> playing<00:00:31.140> notes<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.769> after<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
nothing wrong playing notes but after a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
nothing wrong playing notes but after a
while<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> gets<00:00:32.820> pretty<00:00:33.149> boring<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
while it gets pretty boring so what you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.320 
while it gets pretty boring so what you
need<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.470> do<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> work<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.340> ways<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.000> getting

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
need to do is to work on ways of getting

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.200 
need to do is to work on ways of getting
around<00:00:36.830> playing<00:00:37.830> too<00:00:37.980> many<00:00:38.130> root<00:00:38.370> notes<00:00:38.580> one

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
around playing too many root notes one

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.580 
around playing too many root notes one
great<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.900> can<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> work<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.560> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
great thing you can do is work on a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
great thing you can do is work on a
particular<00:00:41.070> exercise<00:00:41.490> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:41.970> with<00:00:42.150> my

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
particular exercise that I do with my

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.390 
particular exercise that I do with my
students<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.380> what<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.740> do<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> try

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
students and what you can do is try

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.640 
students and what you can do is try
playing<00:00:44.670> something<00:00:45.060> like<00:00:45.240> a<00:00:45.300> blues<00:00:45.720> but

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
playing something like a blues but

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.590 
playing something like a blues but
making<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> rule<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.430> playing<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:48.000> root<00:00:48.330> notes

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
making a rule of playing no root notes

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
making a rule of playing no root notes
the<00:00:49.530> bass<00:00:49.710> players<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.400> root<00:00:50.550> note<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the bass players got the root note the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.920 
the bass players got the root note the
piano<00:00:51.090> players<00:00:51.330> probably<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.720> have<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
piano players probably gonna have the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
piano players probably gonna have the
root<00:00:52.110> note<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.580> playing<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> B<00:00:54.030> flat

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
root note so if we're playing a B flat

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.480 
root note so if we're playing a B flat
blues

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
blues

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.220 
blues
we<00:00:56.490> can't<00:00:56.730> play<00:00:56.880> B<00:00:57.120> flat<00:00:57.150> when<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.750> B<00:00:57.930> flat

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we can't play B flat when it's B flat

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
we can't play B flat when it's B flat
all<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:58.950> we<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.130> to<00:00:59.280> an<00:00:59.340> E<00:00:59.520> flat<00:00:59.700> chord

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
all right when we get to an E flat chord

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.319 
all right when we get to an E flat chord
B<00:01:00.630> flat<00:01:00.900> is<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.230> good<00:01:01.470> but<00:01:01.710> e<00:01:01.890> flat<00:01:02.220> isn't<00:01:02.430> when

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
B flat is now good but e flat isn't when

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
B flat is now good but e flat isn't when
we<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> C<00:01:03.960> minor<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:05.369> can't<00:01:05.640> play

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
we get to C minor we can now can't play

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
we get to C minor we can now can't play
C<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.329> B<00:01:06.509> flat<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.869> E<00:01:06.960> flat<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.319> good<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.649> on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
C but B flat and E flat are good so on

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.099 
C but B flat and E flat are good so on
as<00:01:07.859> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.189> give<00:01:08.340> an<00:01:08.429> example<00:01:08.819> of<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.999> this<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
as I don't give an example of it this is

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:42.840 
as I don't give an example of it this is
a<00:01:10.140> B<00:01:10.350> flat<00:01:10.499> blues

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

so<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.910> can<00:01:44.000> see<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:44.360> was<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.480> couple<00:01:44.720> of

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
so you can see there was a couple of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.630 
so you can see there was a couple of
times<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.350> played<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.680> b-flat<00:01:46.070> note<00:01:46.430> but

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
times that I played a b-flat note but

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.340 
times that I played a b-flat note but
generally<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.480> most<00:01:47.690> part<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.080> didn't

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
generally for the most part I didn't

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.560 
generally for the most part I didn't
play<00:01:48.500> B<00:01:48.740> flat<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.280> B<00:01:49.430> flat<00:01:49.460> chord<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.270> play

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
play B flat on the B flat chord and play

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.840 
play B flat on the B flat chord and play
flat<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.380> E<00:01:51.410> flat<00:01:51.680> chord<00:01:52.040> didn't<00:01:52.729> play

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
flat on the E flat chord didn't play

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.969 
flat on the E flat chord didn't play
someone<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:53.479> on<00:01:53.540> that's<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.620> good<00:01:54.800> way<00:01:54.950> of

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
someone and so on that's a good way of

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.340 
someone and so on that's a good way of
working<00:01:55.340> on<00:01:55.580> your<00:01:55.610> improvising<00:01:56.510> it's

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
working on your improvising it's

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.810 
working on your improvising it's
actually<00:01:57.619> quite<00:01:57.800> difficult<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:58.610> because

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
actually quite difficult to do because

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.150 
actually quite difficult to do because
we<00:01:59.090> tend<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.479> want<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.260> anchor<00:02:00.500> things<00:02:00.950> with

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
we tend to want to anchor things with

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.469 
we tend to want to anchor things with
those<00:02:01.340> root<00:02:01.610> notes<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.060> they're<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> least
