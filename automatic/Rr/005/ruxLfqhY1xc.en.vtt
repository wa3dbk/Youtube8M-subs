00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.390
 like here from this place so that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.530
 to get society to understand what 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.530
 you really need 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.420

 merged with the landscape a man lives in the forest 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.580
 15 years just feel disharmony 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.750
 silence more than another place exactly 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.400
 here I found myself so quiet here 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.730
 there are trees whose age 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 more than a thousand years is the only thing 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.900

 still and mountains the possibility is hollow here 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.400
 stay in solitude 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.440

 some ancient greek legends 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.470
 associated with these particular places 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.980
 an eagle flew in and pecked a liver which 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.790
 the sunset was growing back in the morning 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.010
