image if somebody has like if somebody
tries<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> open<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.630> macbook<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.680> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
tries to open your macbook which this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.469

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
why is that i really recommend this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.920 
why is that i really recommend this
because<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> gets<00:01:55.740> stolen<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.630> actually

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
because if it gets stolen it actually

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
because if it gets stolen it actually
takes<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.649> picture<00:01:58.829> using<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.460> internal
