00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.830
 Shishi 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.399
 car 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.399
 2 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.189
 I tried to pull up the machine 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.910
 The changed body is almost changed 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:28.220
 First chassis ms chassis half mark iii 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.739
 Normal ms that came with Nero It seems to be a light-weight type but I processed it at all 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.890
 There is no ms chassis and gear 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.340
 4 to 1 dentist 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.540
 It is a torque tune motor after Japan Loggia 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.920
 It 's about the slowest thing to go for a while, but it 's smoothed out 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.260
 Even though it does not may be or is higher now and then rotation than in Tomic Maybe 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.379
 You have to torque tune motor sound at that time being torque-oriented 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.559
 Because there are wooden legs, it is quite fast 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.879
 I think the top speed has dropped considerably 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:04.899
 I tried to assembled by Tteyuu accelerating importance of home Sakura 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:10.250
 We use as it is as a roller 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:13.490
 I want to try to run with the feeling that But any child to feel a little anxiety, even this 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 I would like to use this part this time 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:23.649
 This is ms chassis multi brake set 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:29.770
 I divided this a little and used only that gray gold coin 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.720
 I wanted to put it under the body when I informed the shop big cross in front of it and I opened it for a while 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 Though 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.380
 For now got this does not yet used at all by simply taken out of it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.460
 I think I want to stick to the back of the manual 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.330
 Hmm 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.550
 [musics]

 Skimmer opened once the

 Hmm 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.560
 7 minutes 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 Hmm 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 [musics]

 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.319
 Putsu 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.490
 Ray 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.069
 Hmm

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.610
 Hmm 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 yeah 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 me 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.190
 me 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.000
 Completed in 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.730
 It is true It was attached in such a feeling 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.780
 There 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.890
 It is a feeling 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.410
 wh 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.450
 It is less rooted than I thought 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.080
 Oh 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.800
 In your salvation fine vehicle height low position 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.979
 It's coming brake to -1 this 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.979
 [musics] 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:02.250
 I thought it would be a little sluggish because I put the shaft inside, I was unexpectedly hex 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.490
 It's not like moving around like that 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.920
 I have put a shaft in the shaft 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.770
 Hmm 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:17.140
 There is also a short, so if you want only the middle put a short shaft 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:22.710
 You can adjust it like this 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.710
 So let's run here right away 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.810
 Well then I would like to run this machine immediately 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.810
 [musics] 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.569
 tan 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.569
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.600
 [musics] 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.399
 [musics] 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.190
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.630
 [musics] 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.470
 [musics] 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.940
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.470
 [musics] 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 I said in this and jump of 4 stops to say yes 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.369
 Hmm 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.369
 [musics] 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:06.610
 I think that the effect of the selling device was great because of that 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:10.780
 After jumping I got one more proof on the wall between the course and the course 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.930
 You do not have to do what the place I I'll be stuck here 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:20.570
 I wonder if this brake itself will come back to the US 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 Even if I want to put something like this here , I can go at all by just putting this here 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.370
 You also feel that so 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:30.110
 Did you say or something to experience 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.479
 If it is this as it is, it's a bit difficult , but there is a gap here in combination with this roller 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.460
 I do it from being empty it says Tsu bad 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:42.260
 It's not that far from lightweight youngest in that love 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.360
 After jumping and landing on that land , it feels like it's already floating and blowing away. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.700
 Likely to serve as a Mama to the damper at some of 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.860
 I think I have to add what I 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.449
 [musics] 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:59.800
 I think I want to do around here Hen bow measures such things 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:01.190
 Yes , it was a video that I tried to put on my daughter - in-law chassis multi brake set 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.269
 Good to see again 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.269
 [musics] 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.510
