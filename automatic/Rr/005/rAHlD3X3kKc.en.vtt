00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
up all of them that's it was it was cool

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.050 
up all of them that's it was it was cool
for<00:02:08.230> a<00:02:08.290> while<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.890> could<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.760> over

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
for a while I just could not do it over

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and over again because all characters

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
and over again because all characters
have<00:02:11.620> very<00:02:11.830> similar<00:02:12.130> attack

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
and stuff like that and it just gets

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.160 
and stuff like that and it just gets
very<00:02:14.310> repetitive<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.030> very<00:02:15.240> boring<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
very repetitive and very boring the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
issue I have with this is that if this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940

making these dynasty warriors games and
they're<00:02:53.520> not<00:02:53.670> terrible<00:02:54.240> games<00:02:54.480> by<00:02:54.690> any<00:02:54.870> means

they're not terrible games by any means

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.830 
they're not terrible games by any means
but<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:55.530> are<00:02:55.740> very<00:02:56.090> similar<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:57.660> are

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
but they are very similar and they are

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.180 
but they are very similar and they are
kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> same<00:02:58.500> thing<00:02:58.740> over<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> over

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
that I only hope that they identify what

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.240 
that I only hope that they identify what

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.160 
comes out this is the kind of stuff that
I<00:03:26.430> want<00:03:26.610> Nintendo<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.330> doing<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:27.840> trying

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
I want Nintendo to be doing like trying

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.270 
I want Nintendo to be doing like trying
something<00:03:28.380> different<00:03:28.620> with<00:03:29.130> their

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
something different with their

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
something different with their
franchises<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:30.239> out<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.540> different

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
franchises going out in different

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.870 
franchises going out in different
directions<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.769> think<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.820> idea

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
directions I think this is a good idea

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.240 
directions I think this is a good idea
although<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.930> traditional<00:03:34.709> Zelda<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.160> be

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
although a traditional Zelda would be

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.740 
although a traditional Zelda would be
pretty<00:03:35.430> awesome<00:03:35.580> at<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.940> same<00:03:35.970> time<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.630> would

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
pretty awesome at the same time it would

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.930 
pretty awesome at the same time it would
make<00:03:36.900> my<00:03:37.050> wii<00:03:37.290> u<00:03:37.470> freaking<00:03:37.920> worth<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.820> let

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
make my wii u freaking worth it but let

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.920 
make my wii u freaking worth it but let
me<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.300> guys<00:03:39.420> think<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.810> the

comments below about Zelda or about

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.940 
comments below about Zelda or about
Hyrule<00:03:42.510> warriors<00:03:42.540> do<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:43.830> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
Hyrule warriors do you think this is a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
Hyrule warriors do you think this is a
good<00:03:44.100> direction<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.640> take<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.030> game<00:03:45.239> do<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
good direction to take the game do you

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.759 
good direction to take the game do you
think<00:03:45.810> they<00:03:45.900> should<00:03:45.930> do<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.410> spin-off

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
think they should do this as a spin-off

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.949 
think they should do this as a spin-off
for<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.340> forever<00:03:47.730> or<00:03:48.299> do<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.510> think<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
for like forever or do you think this is

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.630 
for like forever or do you think this is
something<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.320> should<00:03:49.470> pretty<00:03:49.920> much<00:03:50.070> go

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
something that should pretty much go

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.210 
something that should pretty much go
