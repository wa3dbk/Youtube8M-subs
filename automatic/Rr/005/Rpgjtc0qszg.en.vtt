00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
well but the p9 is obviously do have

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.690 
well but the p9 is obviously do have
some<00:02:14.000> effect<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:15.340> still<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.430> over<00:02:16.580> there

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
