of<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.830> detailed<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.310> domination<00:00:30.060> certain

of more detailed than domination certain

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.380 
of more detailed than domination certain
ways<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> sometimes<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.730> easy<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.239> do

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually use as a primary some games

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
actually use as a primary some games
because<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because I just like it that much and I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
because I just like it that much and I
don't<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.460> someone<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.090> last<00:00:51.300> mp9<00:00:51.660> Moab

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
don't know someone on my last mp9 Moab

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
don't know someone on my last mp9 Moab
someone<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.860> why<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.340> using<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
someone was like why are you using a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.950 
someone was like why are you using a
secondary<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.570> doing<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
secondary all you're doing is just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660 
secondary all you're doing is just
putting<00:00:55.289> yourself<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> disadvantage<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
putting yourself at a disadvantage I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
putting yourself at a disadvantage I
actually<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.660> gun<00:00:57.870> better<00:00:58.320> than<00:00:58.500> some

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
actually like this gun better than some

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
actually like this gun better than some
primaries<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.699> honest<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> guys<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
primaries to be honest with you guys and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
primaries to be honest with you guys and
I<00:01:01.140> don't<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.559> using<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.129> gun<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> at

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I don't think using this gun put you at

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
I don't think using this gun put you at
a<00:01:02.850> disadvantage<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
a disadvantage at all i think really you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.020 
a disadvantage at all i think really you
know<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> keeps<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
know it keeps you right up there of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
know it keeps you right up there of
course<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.600> guns<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:06.990> gonna

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
course there's some guns that are gonna

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.730 
course there's some guns that are gonna
be<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.799> PP<00:01:08.159> 90<00:01:08.520> mp7<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.200> some

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
be you like PP 90 mp7 and you know some

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
be you like PP 90 mp7 and you know some
other<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.360> submachine<00:01:12.360> guns<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:13.229> long

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
other like submachine guns but at long

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
other like submachine guns but at long
range<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> medium<00:01:14.340> ranges<00:01:14.729> things<00:01:14.970> better

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
range and medium ranges things better

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
range and medium ranges things better
than<00:01:15.270> half<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> submachine<00:01:16.200> guns<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.680> my

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
than half of the submachine guns in my

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
than half of the submachine guns in my
opinion<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.850> long<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.420> you're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
opinion so as long as you know you're

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
opinion so as long as you know you're
staying<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:18.930> medium<00:01:19.320> range<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.920> you'll

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
staying at medium range i think you'll

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.410 
staying at medium range i think you'll
be<00:01:20.100> good<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> still<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.210> long

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
be good but you still want to go long

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
be good but you still want to go long
range<00:01:21.720> sometimes<00:01:22.229> might<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.740> against

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
range sometimes might have to go against

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
range sometimes might have to go against
salt<00:01:23.340> rifles<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:24.630> overall<00:01:24.930> i<00:01:25.049> would

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
salt rifles but you know overall i would

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
salt rifles but you know overall i would
have<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> best<00:01:26.340> secondary

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
have to say this is the best secondary

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
have to say this is the best secondary
in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> game<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> also<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:28.200> favorite<00:01:28.470> i

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
in the game and also my favorite i
