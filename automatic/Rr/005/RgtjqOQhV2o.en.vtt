bow song and almost like it was wrong is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.370 
bow song and almost like it was wrong is
the<00:00:22.199> fact<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.550> latch<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the fact that the the latch and it's the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.810 
the fact that the the latch and it's the
same<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.710> both<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.010> these<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.519> they're

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
same on both of these this one they're

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
same on both of these this one they're
almost<00:00:27.300> identical<00:00:27.539> knives<00:00:28.019> did<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> obvious

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
almost identical knives did the obvious

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.310 
almost identical knives did the obvious
obvious<00:00:29.310> difference<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.150> has

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
obvious difference is that this has

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.569 
obvious difference is that this has
brass<00:00:31.320> handles<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> brass<00:00:32.070> latch<00:00:32.309> as

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
brass handles and a brass latch as

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.549 
brass handles and a brass latch as
opposed<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> stainless<00:00:33.390> handles<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
opposed to stainless handles and the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.970 
opposed to stainless handles and the
brass<00:00:34.739> latch<00:00:35.899> but<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.260> you'll<00:00:37.410> notice<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
brass latch but what you'll notice is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
brass latch but what you'll notice is
that<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.940> latch<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.590> on<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.129> safe<00:00:41.579> handle<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that the latch is on the safe handle the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.709 
that the latch is on the safe handle the
sharpened<00:00:43.079> edge<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:44.030> I<00:00:45.030> don't

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
sharpened edge is over here I don't

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
sharpened edge is over here I don't
necessarily<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.280> wrong

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
necessarily think it's right or wrong

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
necessarily think it's right or wrong
you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.390> depending<00:00:48.690> where<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:48.989> latch<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you know depending where your latch is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.479 
you know depending where your latch is
like<00:00:49.500> most<00:00:49.680> people<00:00:49.920> might<00:00:50.039> say<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.399> that's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
like most people might say well that's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.650 
like most people might say well that's
wrong<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.149> supposed<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
wrong it's not supposed to be on the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
wrong it's not supposed to be on the
side<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.500> actually<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.860> believe<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.910> just

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
side well actually I believe it's just

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
side well actually I believe it's just
called<00:00:54.600> Manila<00:00:54.960> style<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.340> a

called Manila style and it's like a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.290 
called Manila style and it's like a
preference<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.420> necessarily<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:59.300> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
preference I don't necessarily have you

believe it's called Manila style but to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
believe it's called Manila style but to
tell<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.330> besides<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
tell you that this besides you know the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.670 
tell you that this besides you know the
obvious<00:01:28.799> difference<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> latch<00:01:30.680> even

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
obvious difference with the latch even

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.819 
obvious difference with the latch even
though<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.579> crappy<00:01:33.390> knife<00:01:33.829> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
though this is like a crappy knife it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.789 
though this is like a crappy knife it's
one<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> better<00:01:35.250> crappier<00:01:36.000> knives

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this blade steel is harder will actually

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
this blade steel is harder will actually
use<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.540> while<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> knife

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to use to cut with and it just will not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.910 
to use to cut with and it just will not
hold<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.829> edge<00:01:43.979> very<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.920> the

design<00:04:29.660> it's<00:04:29.960> originally<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:31.430> believe

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
design it's originally I believe

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.850 
design it's originally I believe
somewhere<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.720> Europe<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.410> then<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.830> course

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
somewhere in Europe but then of course

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.159 
somewhere in Europe but then of course
taken<00:04:34.400> over<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:34.760> mostly<00:04:35.150> known<00:04:35.510> from<00:04:35.990> the

Philippines

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.710 
Philippines
so<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.520> Filipinos<00:04:37.970> definitely<00:04:38.419> get<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
so the Filipinos definitely get the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.500 
so the Filipinos definitely get the
credit<00:04:39.020> for<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.200> bow<00:04:39.320> song<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:41.240> know<00:04:41.330> they've

already<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:02.450> thing<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.720> holding<00:05:02.810> up<00:05:03.050> pretty

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
already this thing is holding up pretty

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.740 
already this thing is holding up pretty
well<00:05:03.290> isn't<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.770> it's<00:05:04.760> telling<00:05:05.300> it's<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.510> pins

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
well isn't it it's telling it's the pins

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.860 
the pins as opposed to the screws screws
have<00:05:10.430> their<00:05:10.610> benefits<00:05:11.060> over<00:05:11.210> pins<00:05:11.510> because

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
have their benefits over pins because

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.180 
have their benefits over pins because
you<00:05:11.960> can<00:05:12.080> adjust<00:05:12.169> them<00:05:12.530> for<00:05:12.800> how<00:05:12.889> tight<00:05:13.160> or

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
loose you want it but the problem is
