00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
one we're actually looking into that and

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.899 
one we're actually looking into that and
we<00:01:45.409> know<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.560> people<00:01:46.039> do<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.670> library

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
we know that people do have a library

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.029 
we know that people do have a library
the<00:01:47.630> good<00:01:47.810> news<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.229> library<00:01:48.799> doesn't<00:01:48.920> go

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
the good news is that library doesn't go

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.200 
the good news is that library doesn't go
away<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:49.430> you've<00:01:49.549> got<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> library

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
away and if you've got the library

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.209 
away and if you've got the library
you've<00:01:50.299> probably<00:01:50.479> got<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.719> PSP<00:01:51.049> we're<00:01:51.950> looking

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
you've probably got a PSP we're looking

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.230 
you've probably got a PSP we're looking
into<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.610> see<00:01:52.700> if<00:01:52.789> there's<00:01:52.939> some<00:01:53.060> way<00:01:53.090> to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
into that to see if there's some way to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.910 
into that to see if there's some way to
get<00:01:53.689> those<00:01:53.899> files<00:01:54.110> convert<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.710> digital

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
get those files convert it to a digital

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.380 
get those files convert it to a digital
format<00:01:55.399> as<00:01:55.520> well<00:01:55.700> now<00:01:56.060> what<00:01:56.240> are<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
format as well now what are the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
format as well now what are the
differences<00:01:56.689> sort<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.530> physically<00:01:57.979> between

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
differences sort of physically between

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.310 
differences sort of physically between
the<00:01:58.549> go<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.420> PSP<00:01:59.840> I<00:01:59.869> know<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.109> screen

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
the go and the PSP I know the screen

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.170 
the go and the PSP I know the screen
size<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.740> little<00:02:00.829> bit<00:02:01.070> smaller<00:02:01.369> on<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.030> go

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
size is a little bit smaller on the go

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.940 
size is a little bit smaller on the go
right<00:02:02.420> it's<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.930> tiny<00:02:03.200> bit<00:02:03.409> smaller<00:02:03.740> but

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
right it's a tiny bit smaller but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.149 
right it's a tiny bit smaller but
basically<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.609> is<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:05.200> lighter<00:02:06.200> unit<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.070> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
basically this is a lighter unit it's a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.590 
basically this is a lighter unit it's a
small<00:02:07.399> unit<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.789> forty<00:02:08.090> percent<00:02:08.359> lighter

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
small unit it's forty percent lighter

going back to last year and again I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.490 
going back to last year and again I
think<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.670> lineup<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.150> year<00:03:38.210> tops<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.230> so

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
think the lineup this year tops that so

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.560 
think the lineup this year tops that so
often<00:03:40.220> times<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.970> know<00:03:41.090> we<00:03:41.120> get<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.390> question

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.210 
often times you know we get the question
what<00:03:41.780> do<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.900> do<00:03:42.020> for<00:03:42.170> an<00:03:42.260> encore<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.800> it's

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
what do you do for an encore and it's

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.590 
what do you do for an encore and it's
something<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.670> we<00:03:43.820> take<00:03:43.970> seriously<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:44.570> i

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
something that we take seriously but i

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.760 
something that we take seriously but i
think<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.900> lineup<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:45.230> year<00:03:45.290> speaks<00:03:45.650> for

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
think the lineup this year speaks for

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.710 
think the lineup this year speaks for
itself<00:03:45.800> i<00:03:46.310> think<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> big<00:03:47.210> question<00:03:47.360> probably

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
itself i think the big question probably

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.000 
itself i think the big question probably
everyone<00:03:48.080> has<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:48.680> look<00:03:48.710> at<00:03:48.920> your

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
everyone has is they look at your

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.500 
everyone has is they look at your
