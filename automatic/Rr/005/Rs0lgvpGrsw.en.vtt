00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 beautiful all the boys of gf clanio are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.039
 objects carried and today brings you one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
 beautiful fast mv 3 fast motorcycle performed 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.340
 on team deathmatch 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.189
 death should have been 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 carried out around 140 4 seconds 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.630
 second plus second less and no 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 I think it changes a lot 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 with a p 90 equipped with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 silencer and increased loaders 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 while the map his choice already noticed 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 it is carbon that is precisely one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.510
 map not much played by the players e 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.039
 I didn't even check on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 youtube you don't see that much on 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.500
 of strange moab or even I know about various 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.690
 very easy mode as a domain 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 in short, when it is enough to close the enemies 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 on a flag and the game is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.149
 practically done and then on 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 deathmatch everything even happier 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.189
 because in any case there are enemies 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 slightly more scarce than normal, however 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.549
 respawns are quite not fixed 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.200
 in fact they are variable, so do not dominate 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.840
 another term comes to mind another term 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.689
 but then if you have already understood the meaning and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 so it's always easy I have 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.210
 one behind especially if you are inside 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 the spawn that will kill you in short 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 in fact, as you can see, I learned a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.380
 trick with a bit of experience is not 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 a very difficult thing though 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.119
 advice if you want to do some 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 fast enough deathmatch fashions by 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.979
 always stay where they are less 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.450
 allies since where on the arrivals the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.570
 allies, they will never play 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.079
 enemies in fact always looked for places 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490
 a little more allies empty to make a 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.280
 little massacre 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.399
 I felt a little unsure 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 indeed of this p90 because so many times me 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.790
 he says that he takes out my enemies, though 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 did the kill with mine anyway 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.310
 not so much opinion but I have been 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 pretty good and clever in some 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.069
 occasions because knowing that the p 90 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.069
 we suck a little or maybe me 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.590
 hid 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.969
 I expected them and I am 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.829
 managed to work in any case 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.499
 I hope the gameplay is there anyway 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.930
 liked because it's almost over 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.069
 left so many beautiful I like tell us 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 always recommend new ones you see 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.040
 to do because I am very happy to 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.670
 make the other members also the others 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.019
 I think, however, I speak for myself then 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 recommended write everything in the comments 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.980
 what you want left me so many 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.499
 like pass by my channel if you want 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.209

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.219
