00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.689
 let's join 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.620
 open the strands on the right side and 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.620
 to the left 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.219
 but we continue with a strand of the lateral 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 right and we already started the braided by 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 the other side 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.530
 we take another strand from the left side 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:44.470
 tightly we are linking 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.079
 always isolating perfectly the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.829
 lines 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 to get more prolixity we return 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 to the right side 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.760
 we combed well 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.910
 is fundamental with the prolixity in this 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.120
 I work so we will see by 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.850
 strand if necessary 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.850
 use it out wait and we can use it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.290
 we continue working 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.820
 we apply lacquer or spray 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 now we continue with the left side 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.970
 taking a strand from the side to join 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.289
 with the strands that we already have above is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.360
 a three-part braid the movement 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.140
 will go from the right part 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 to the left we take another strand and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 unite we continue on the right side 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.250
 and distributing in segments to be able 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.250
 press up 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.380
 remember that in the spray application 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.550
 or lacquer that has to be dry in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 collected not because it has to be 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.760
 dry so you do not disarm 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.550
 in this case we have very good body in 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.220
 the hair is therefore not complicated 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.500
 the task with this hair lowered but 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.200
 if it is reduced and we can not join it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.310
 best shape is with lacquer or spray 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 let's go with the other side we take a 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.640
 strand of right another of left and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's braid remember we're going 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.790
 Making a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.790
 braid on the outside we take another strand 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.239
 we can apply a little spray to go 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.239
 hitting 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.530
 our model can be
