this started so what is this glitch what

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
this started so what is this glitch what
does<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.510> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
does it do and how do you do it so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
does it do and how do you do it so
basically<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:31.920> much<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.940> one

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
basically it's pretty much probably one

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
basically it's pretty much probably one
of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> most<00:00:33.540> badass<00:00:34.340> imported<00:00:35.340> glitches

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of the most badass imported glitches

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
of the most badass imported glitches
ever<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
ever so what you have to do is you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
ever so what you have to do is you
basically<00:00:38.190> build<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> importa<00:00:39.510> frame<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
basically build the importa frame and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
basically build the importa frame and
you<00:00:40.680> makes<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you makes it like you're going to the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
you makes it like you're going to the
end<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> put<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.840> chests<00:00:43.079> inside

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
end but you put the end of chests inside

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.049 
end but you put the end of chests inside
of<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> before<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.460> put<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> eye<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of it before you put the eye of the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
of it before you put the eye of the
enders<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> once<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
enders in and once you do that it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
enders in and once you do that it
basically<00:00:47.160> glitches<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.000> what's<00:00:48.329> ever

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
basically glitches out what's ever

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
basically glitches out what's ever
inside<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.710> far<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.129> works<00:00:50.430> for

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
inside of it now so far this works for

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
inside of it now so far this works for
about<00:00:50.700> three<00:00:51.120> items<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> will<00:00:52.440> show<00:00:52.590> you

were to walk into it you would go

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
were to walk into it you would go
directly<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> end<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.950 
don't don't prank your friends like that
because<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:17.970> would<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.659> funny

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
because that would just not be funny

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.120 
because that would just not be funny
they<00:01:19.080> probably<00:01:19.259> would<00:01:19.470> never<00:01:19.650> forget<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
they probably would never forget that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
they probably would never forget that
but<00:01:20.850> anyway<00:01:21.090> he's<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.600> walk<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:22.020> into<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but anyway he's gonna walk right into it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
but anyway he's gonna walk right into it
and<00:01:22.560> voila<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.610> goes<00:01:23.790> straight<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> end

the next one this one's pretty deadly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.999

because<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.630> invisible<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
because it's actually invisible so you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.350 
because it's actually invisible so you
want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> brewing<00:01:47.790> stand<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> make

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
sure you have your in portal frame lined

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
sure you have your in portal frame lined
up<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.399> put<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> brewing<00:01:50.970> stand<00:01:51.000> inside<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
up you put the brewing stand inside and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
up you put the brewing stand inside and
then<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> eye<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.680> ender<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> next

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then you put the eye of ender in it next

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
then you put the eye of ender in it next
if<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.750> work<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:55.110> sure<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> break<00:01:55.560> one

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
if it doesn't work be sure to break one

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.260 
if it doesn't work be sure to break one
and<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> higher<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> back<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and put the higher in the back and it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
and put the higher in the back and it
will<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.170> portal<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.619> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
will actually make the in portal and as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
will actually make the in portal and as
you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.130> finished<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you can see I finished it and it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
you can see I finished it and it
disappears<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
disappears so right now that is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.100 
disappears so right now that is
invisible<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.909> someone<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.780> walk<00:02:03.960> into

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
invisible so someone was to walk into

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
invisible so someone was to walk into
that<00:02:04.200> again<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.340> directly<00:02:05.549> into

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
that again they would go directly into

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:06.730 
that again they would go directly into
the<00:02:06.390> end

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the end

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.130 
the end
so<00:02:07.370> what<00:02:07.670> happened<00:02:07.909> was<00:02:08.030> he<00:02:08.179> kept<00:02:08.390> respawning

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
so what happened was he kept respawning

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.690 
so what happened was he kept respawning
and<00:02:09.229> when<00:02:09.679> he<00:02:09.740> spawned<00:02:10.039> he'll<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.520> hit

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and when he spawned he'll be like hit

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.850 
and when he spawned he'll be like hit
directly<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.750> spot<00:02:12.020> he<00:02:12.470> would<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.709> keep

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
directly on that spot he would just keep

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.830 
directly on that spot he would just keep
going<00:02:13.100> back<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.520> forth<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> end<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.390> such

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
going back and forth to the end and such

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.910 
going back and forth to the end and such
things<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:15.440> that's<00:02:15.620> pretty<00:02:15.800> much

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
things like that but that's pretty much

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070 
things like that but that's pretty much
