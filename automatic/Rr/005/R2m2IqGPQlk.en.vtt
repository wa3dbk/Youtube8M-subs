hello there this is the Sparkle drive by
voodoo<00:00:03.629> lab<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.319> would<00:00:04.500> say<00:00:04.830> it<00:00:04.950> exists

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
voodoo lab I would say it exists

camp of the world of pedals got four
knobs<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.290> we've<00:00:10.469> got<00:00:10.650> gain<00:00:10.980> which<00:00:11.429> controls

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
knobs here we've got gain which controls

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
knobs here we've got gain which controls
the<00:00:12.120> amount<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.389> gain<00:00:12.950> tone<00:00:13.950> which<00:00:14.219> works

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the amount of gain tone which works

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.730 
the amount of gain tone which works
pretty<00:00:14.759> standard<00:00:15.240> darker<00:00:15.839> x'<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> left

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
pretty standard darker x' to the left

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.519 
pretty standard darker x' to the left
brighter<00:00:17.340> x'<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.720> clean<00:00:19.230> knob

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
brighter x' to the right a clean knob

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.349 
brighter x' to the right a clean knob
which<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> amount<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> clean<00:00:20.730> signal<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
which is the amount of clean signal and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
which is the amount of clean signal and
it's<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> blend<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.470> how<00:00:23.400> much<00:00:23.580> clean

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
it's actually a blend of how much clean

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
it's actually a blend of how much clean
signal<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> mixed<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> dirty<00:00:25.529> signal

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
signal is mixed in with the dirty signal

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.439 
signal is mixed in with the dirty signal
that<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> generate<00:00:26.699> over<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:27.330> these

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that you generate over here with these

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.480 
that you generate over here with these
two<00:00:27.510> knobs<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> way<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> right

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
two knobs so all the way to the right

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
two knobs so all the way to the right
would<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:30.090> clean<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.050> ignores<00:00:31.439> these

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
would be all clean and it ignores these

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
would be all clean and it ignores these
two<00:00:31.859> knobs<00:00:32.040> entirely<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
two knobs entirely all the way to the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290 
two knobs entirely all the way to the
left<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.989> all<00:00:34.680> dirty<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.370> ignores<00:00:35.790> any<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
left is all dirty and ignores any of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.389 
left is all dirty and ignores any of
your<00:00:36.480> clean<00:00:36.719> guitar<00:00:37.020> signal<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.070> useful

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
your clean guitar signal so it's useful

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
your clean guitar signal so it's useful
for<00:00:38.430> adding<00:00:38.820> clarity<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.390> whatnot<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.930> what

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
for adding clarity and whatnot it's what

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
for adding clarity and whatnot it's what
makes<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> pedal<00:00:40.680> awesome<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.790> volume

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
makes this pedal awesome and then volume

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
makes this pedal awesome and then volume
pretty<00:00:42.510> standard<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.170> sets<00:00:43.410> where<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
pretty standard just sets where the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.299 
pretty standard just sets where the
volume<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:45.239> playing<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.780> ash<00:00:45.960> t57<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
volume is I'm playing an ash t57 into a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.690 
volume is I'm playing an ash t57 into a
morgen<00:00:47.760> RCA<00:00:48.090> 35<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:49.530> using<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> mics<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
morgen RCA 35 I'm using all the mics I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
morgen RCA 35 I'm using all the mics I
have<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> try<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.390> make<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.750> sound<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.230> much

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have to try and make it sound as much

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.520 
have to try and make it sound as much
like<00:00:52.710> being<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> room<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
like being in the room as we can and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.800 
like being in the room as we can and
other<00:00:55.530> than<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.550> clean<00:00:57.030> tone

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.789 

you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 

and<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.700> current<00:01:06.000> settings<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> sparkle

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and the current settings on the sparkle

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.640 
and the current settings on the sparkle
drunk

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.910 

you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 

so<00:01:17.820> we've<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.240> set<00:01:18.510> with<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.690> slight<00:01:19.409> boost

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so we've got it set with a slight boost

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
so we've got it set with a slight boost
above<00:01:20.250> unity<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.880> we've<00:01:21.120> got<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> clean<00:01:21.810> knob

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
above unity and we've got the clean knob

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.810 
above unity and we've got the clean knob
here<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.440> noon<00:01:22.620> which<00:01:22.860> means<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.460> equal

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
here at noon which means it's an equal

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.700 
here at noon which means it's an equal
mix<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.420> dirty<00:01:24.690> signal<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.350> our<00:01:25.440> clean

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
mix of our dirty signal and our clean

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
mix of our dirty signal and our clean
signal<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:27.390> turn<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.110> clean<00:01:28.440> knob<00:01:28.650> all

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
signal so let's turn this clean knob all

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
signal so let's turn this clean knob all
the<00:01:28.979> way<00:01:29.100> off<00:01:29.450> because<00:01:30.450> that'll<00:01:30.900> give<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the way off because that'll give you the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
the way off because that'll give you the
best<00:01:31.500> idea<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.520> two<00:01:32.850> things<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.990> by

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
best idea of what these two things do by

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
best idea of what these two things do by
themselves<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.920> completely<00:01:35.220> dirty

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
themselves so it's completely dirty

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.969 
themselves so it's completely dirty
signal<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:36.750> clean<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.830> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
signal right now and no clean this is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.960 
signal right now and no clean this is
what<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> sounds<00:01:38.430> like

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.870 

so<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.780> can<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.080> how<00:01:47.200> much<00:01:47.490> dirtier<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.640> gets

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
so you can see how much dirtier it gets

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.120 
so you can see how much dirtier it gets
and<00:01:49.180> less<00:01:49.510> clear<00:01:49.870> when<00:01:50.110> you've<00:01:50.290> taken<00:01:50.920> your

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
and less clear when you've taken your

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.740 
and less clear when you've taken your
clean<00:01:51.370> signal<00:01:51.610> out<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.090> equation<00:01:52.600> there

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
clean signal out of the equation there

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.110 
clean signal out of the equation there
so<00:01:53.020> lots<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.010> options<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.490> let's<00:01:54.520> go<00:01:54.760> through

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
so lots of options so let's go through

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:17.300 
so lots of options so let's go through
the<00:01:55.450> gain<00:01:56.050> knob<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.770> show<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.160> range

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.950 

so<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> clean<00:02:18.240> knob<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.630> way<00:02:18.750> off

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
so with the clean knob all the way off

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.990 
so with the clean knob all the way off
you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.320> kind<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> enter<00:02:20.010> tubescreamer<00:02:20.460> type

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
you can kind of enter tubescreamer type

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.400 
you can kind of enter tubescreamer type

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
territory with this pedal which is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.340 
territory with this pedal which is
pretty<00:02:22.590> cool<00:02:23.090> show<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.390> range<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
pretty cool show you the range of the

pretty cool show you the range of the
tone

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.130

plenty of extra grit and brightness to

plenty of extra grit and brightness to
be<00:02:54.469> had<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:55.120> let<00:02:56.120> me<00:02:56.269> show<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.629> just<00:02:57.230> all

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
be had there let me show you just all

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.819 
be had there let me show you just all
the<00:02:58.219> way<00:02:58.340> clean<00:02:59.079> which<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.109> ignoring<00:03:00.709> these

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
the way clean which is ignoring these

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.920 
the way clean which is ignoring these
two<00:03:01.099> knobs<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.640> can<00:03:02.000> max<00:03:02.329> them<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.689> it<00:03:02.750> won't

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
two knobs I can max them and it won't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.009 
two knobs I can max them and it won't
make<00:03:03.140> any<00:03:03.200> difference<00:03:03.909> but<00:03:04.909> this<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.780> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
make any difference but this is just a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.619 
make any difference but this is just a
boot<00:03:09.459> which<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.609> boosting<00:03:11.000> pretty<00:03:11.239> heavily

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
boot which is boosting pretty heavily

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.869 
boot which is boosting pretty heavily
this<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.989> probably<00:03:12.349> more<00:03:12.530> around<00:03:12.889> unity<00:03:13.730> or

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
this is probably more around unity or

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.750 
this is probably more around unity or
slight

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.210 

you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.340 

you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.760 

you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.280 

so<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.820> see<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.270> just<00:03:30.660> adds<00:03:30.870> just

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
so you can see it really just adds just

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.010 
so you can see it really just adds just
a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.800> bit<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.160> presence<00:03:32.490> or<00:03:32.910> sparkle<00:03:33.870> as

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
a little bit of presence or sparkle as

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.220 
a little bit of presence or sparkle as
the<00:03:34.410> name<00:03:34.590> might<00:03:34.860> imply<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.940> will<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.960> your

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the name might imply if you will to your

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.620 
the name might imply if you will to your
clean<00:03:37.650> signal<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.580> if<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.790> want<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> use<00:03:39.210> in<00:03:39.420> in

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
clean signal so if you want to use in in

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.520 
clean signal so if you want to use in in
that<00:03:39.960> way<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:40.680> good<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.370> well

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
that way then it's good for that as well

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.190 
that way then it's good for that as well
so<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:43.710> let's<00:03:44.640> go<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.270> little<00:03:45.300> bit<00:03:45.600> back<00:03:45.900> toward

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so now let's go a little bit back toward

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.310 
so now let's go a little bit back toward
where<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.410> were<00:03:46.880> what<00:03:47.880> would<00:03:48.000> be<00:03:48.150> about<00:03:48.480> unity

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
where we were what would be about unity

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.580 
where we were what would be about unity
ish<00:03:50.150> with<00:03:51.150> some<00:03:51.450> blending<00:03:51.900> happening<00:03:52.380> and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
ish with some blending happening and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.590 
ish with some blending happening and
then<00:03:52.740> just<00:03:53.010> show<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.250> let's<00:03:53.970> set<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> pretty

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
then just show you let's set a pretty

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.260 
then just show you let's set a pretty
high<00:03:54.920> gain<00:03:55.920> setting<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.580> we'll<00:03:56.760> start<00:03:57.090> all

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
high gain setting and we'll start all

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.120 
high gain setting and we'll start all
the<00:03:57.390> way<00:03:57.480> clean<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.020> then<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.320> blend<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.860> or

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
the way clean and then just blend in or

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.410 
the way clean and then just blend in or
blend<00:03:59.490> out<00:03:59.700> some<00:04:00.060> more<00:04:00.210> of<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.330> clean<00:04:00.540> signal

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.710 

you

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.740 

you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:19.640 
you
you

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.860 

so<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.430> can<00:04:20.579> hear<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.970> clean<00:04:21.209> signal<00:04:21.449> start

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
so you can hear the clean signal start

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.540 
so you can hear the clean signal start
to<00:04:22.049> disappear<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.919> kind<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.310> further

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
to disappear just kind of the further

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.640 
to disappear just kind of the further
you<00:04:23.760> go<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.870> useful<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.290> adding

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
you go and so it's useful for adding

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.420 
you go and so it's useful for adding
clarity<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.340> you've<00:04:26.520> got<00:04:26.699> let's<00:04:26.940> say<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> fairly

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
clarity if you've got let's say a fairly

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.580 
clarity if you've got let's say a fairly
strong<00:04:29.430> gain<00:04:30.270> setting<00:04:30.840> happening<00:04:31.410> which<00:04:31.560> is

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
strong gain setting happening which is

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:51.830 
strong gain setting happening which is
like

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.020 

and<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:52.919> want<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.220> add<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.400> little<00:04:53.760> bit

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
and you just want to add a little bit

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.330 
and you just want to add a little bit
more<00:04:54.300> clarity<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.350> signal<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.919> might<00:04:56.130> do

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
more clarity to that signal you might do

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:23.059 
more clarity to that signal you might do
something<00:04:56.669> like<00:04:56.850> this

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.519 

so<00:05:24.069> lots<00:05:24.460> of<00:05:24.699> versatility<00:05:25.539> that<00:05:25.779> you<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.289> Hugh

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
so lots of versatility that you can Hugh

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.739 
so lots of versatility that you can Hugh
do<00:05:26.710> here<00:05:26.979> with<00:05:27.129> this<00:05:27.279> blend<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:27.909> clean<00:05:28.569> and

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
do here with this blend of clean and

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.959 
do here with this blend of clean and
dirty<00:05:28.899> there's<00:05:29.259> a<00:05:29.319> lot<00:05:29.589> of<00:05:29.740> other<00:05:30.189> options<00:05:30.550> in

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
dirty there's a lot of other options in

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.489 
dirty there's a lot of other options in
terms<00:05:31.089> of<00:05:31.300> how<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.509> could<00:05:31.719> dial<00:05:31.959> it<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.289> but

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:32.499
