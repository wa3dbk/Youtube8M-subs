00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
writers were a minority and that only a

few of us were born with the ability to
do<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.290> was<00:00:38.920> wrong<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.579> that's<00:00:40.360> when<00:00:40.570> the

do it I was wrong and that's when the
major<00:00:40.840> blocks<00:00:41.230> have<00:00:41.469> stood<00:00:41.680> in<00:00:41.800> my<00:00:41.980> way

into getting into that writing process
what<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.270> really<00:00:58.660> is<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.699> why<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:00.760> can

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
what it really is and why you can

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.840 
what it really is and why you can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
will mention later because there's a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.399

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
first of all I believe a big part of

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.870 
first of all I believe a big part of
life<00:01:19.900> is<00:01:20.590> finding<00:01:20.830> out<00:01:21.040> what<00:01:21.280> works<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.759> what

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
life is finding out what works and what

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.789 
life is finding out what works and what
doesn't<00:01:22.150> work<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:23.020> good<00:01:23.229> portion<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.710> my

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
doesn't work and a good portion of my

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.100 
doesn't work and a good portion of my
early<00:01:24.159> years<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.790> found<00:01:25.330> out<00:01:25.540> what<00:01:25.720> didn't<00:01:25.990> work

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
early years I found out what didn't work

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.289 
early years I found out what didn't work
I<00:01:26.259> picked<00:01:26.470> up<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.740> degree<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.400> few<00:01:28.150> degrees

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
I picked up a degree a few degrees

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.749 
I picked up a degree a few degrees
actually<00:01:28.659> in<00:01:29.080> writing<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.680> which<00:01:30.430> I'm<00:01:30.579> still

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
actually in writing and which I'm still

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.149 
actually in writing and which I'm still
paying<00:01:31.000> for<00:01:31.060> not<00:01:31.329> financially<00:01:31.960> but<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:32.950> didn't

have any problems as a writing and as a
writer<00:01:35.020> until<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.470> actually<00:01:35.740> studied<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.430> art

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
writer until I actually studied the art

writer until I actually studied the art
form<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.119> learned<00:01:37.810> under<00:01:38.170> people<00:01:38.560> who<00:01:38.950> are

not<00:01:39.250> successful<00:01:39.490> authors<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:41.079> we<00:01:41.110> need<00:01:41.350> to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
not successful authors and we need to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.109 
not successful authors and we need to
start<00:01:41.650> like<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.860> 12-step<00:01:42.400> program<00:01:42.430> for<00:01:43.000> those

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
start like a 12-step program for those

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.330 
start like a 12-step program for those
of<00:01:43.270> us<00:01:43.390> who<00:01:43.509> have<00:01:43.600> degrees<00:01:43.900> in<00:01:43.930> writing<00:01:44.439> so<00:01:45.310> I

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
of us who have degrees in writing so I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.399 
of us who have degrees in writing so I
tried<00:01:45.700> everything<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.299> an<00:01:46.420> Orthodox<00:01:46.990> method

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
tried everything of an Orthodox method

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.929 
tried everything of an Orthodox method
that<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.590> could<00:01:47.799> find<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.340> be<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.520> author<00:01:48.759> I

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
that I could find to be the author I

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.280
