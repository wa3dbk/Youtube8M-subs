00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
to go

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.150 
to go
now<00:03:55.910> I'm<00:03:56.330> going<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.720> come<00:03:56.900> along<00:03:57.020> on<00:03:57.410> my<00:03:57.740> score

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
now I'm going to come along on my score

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.080 
now I'm going to come along on my score
lines<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:02.360> work<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.140> girls<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:04.610> crease

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
lines and really work it girls to crease

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.560 
lines and really work it girls to crease
that<00:04:05.360> down<00:04:05.600> on<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.960> side<00:04:07.150> fold<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.360> other

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
that down on that side fold the other

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.699 
that down on that side fold the other
side<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:11.380> really<00:04:12.380> get<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:12.800> good<00:04:13.100> crease

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
side in really get that a good crease

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.060 
side in really get that a good crease
and<00:04:16.359> voila<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:18.020> all<00:04:18.290> there<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.650> it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
and voila that is all there is to it

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.990 
and voila that is all there is to it
because<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:20.180> window<00:04:20.630> she<00:04:21.220> really<00:04:22.220> bends<00:04:22.820> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
because the window she really bends and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.370 
because the window she really bends and
really<00:04:23.479> holds<00:04:24.080> that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
really holds that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.310 
really holds that
shape<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:26.030> clips<00:04:26.450> right<00:04:26.870> there<00:04:27.140> on

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
shape so that it clips right there on

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.680 
shape so that it clips right there on
the<00:04:27.440> side<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.650> my<00:04:27.860> simply<00:04:28.220> scored<00:04:28.250> tool<00:04:28.690> when

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.510 
the side of my simply scored tool when
you<00:04:29.780> pop<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.020> off<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.530> still<00:04:30.890> holds<00:04:31.310> its<00:04:31.370> shape

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
you pop it off it still holds its shape

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.680 
you pop it off it still holds its shape
on<00:04:32.360> enough<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.590> off<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.790> off<00:04:34.880> if<00:04:35.480> you
