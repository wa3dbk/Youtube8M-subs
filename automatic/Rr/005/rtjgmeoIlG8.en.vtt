00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but it tends to be in this one area this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
but it tends to be in this one area this
is<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.460> important<00:01:08.850> area<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> friends

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is a really important area of friends

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.750 
is a really important area of friends
when<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.740> through<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> health<00:01:11.130> crisis<00:01:11.610> we

we're at so this is our common friend
circle<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.430> skip<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> middle<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
circle I'm gonna skip the middle one and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960 
circle I'm gonna skip the middle one and
come<00:01:18.630> back<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> moment<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.850> as

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
come back to it in just a moment but as

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
come back to it in just a moment but as
you<00:01:21.090> move<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you move to the right side of the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.530 
you move to the right side of the
continuum<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.670> happen<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
continuum two things happen one is the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
continuum two things happen one is the
frequency<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.350> people<00:01:28.590> tends

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
frequency with which we see people tends

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280 
frequency with which we see people tends
to<00:01:29.460> often<00:01:29.640> increase<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:31.020> but

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
to often increase a little bit more but

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
to often increase a little bit more but
the<00:01:31.409> second<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:32.009> important<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the second more important thing is that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999 
the second more important thing is that
what<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.140> common<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.770> somebody

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
what we have in common with somebody

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
what we have in common with somebody
begins<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> branch<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.659> have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
begins to branch out so that we have

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.050 
begins to branch out so that we have
other<00:01:36.930> things<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.470> common<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.909> for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
other things in common with them so for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
other things in common with them so for
example<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.780> our<00:01:40.200> moms<00:01:40.950> playgroup

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
example it would be our moms playgroup

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
example it would be our moms playgroup
friends<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:42.899> inviting<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.320> for

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
the continuum but for whatever reason we

the continuum but for whatever reason we
moved<00:02:41.519> often<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.690> most<00:02:42.870> most<00:02:43.650> popular<00:02:44.459> one

we don't have the same frequency with
them<00:02:47.250> anymore<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.450> pick<00:02:48.720> up<00:02:48.870> where<00:02:49.140> we

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
them anymore so we can pick up where we

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.650 
them anymore so we can pick up where we
left<00:02:49.410> off<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:50.040> solve<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> intimacy<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
left off we solve the intimacy but we

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.229 
left off we solve the intimacy but we
don't<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.530> consistency<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.910> these<00:02:54.060> are

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
don't have the consistency so these are

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.880 
don't have the consistency so these are
women<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.599> have<00:02:54.810> been<00:02:54.840> confirmed<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.829> we

love them they love us we call them for
the<00:02:58.019> big<00:02:58.170> stuff<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.430> no<00:02:59.549> longer<00:02:59.579> have

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the big stuff but they no longer have
