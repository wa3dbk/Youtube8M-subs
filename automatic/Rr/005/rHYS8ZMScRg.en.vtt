00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello everyone how are welcome to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.950
 I like my name is sonia and in the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.950
 tutorial today I teach them to do about 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.260
 practical and original bookmarks that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 Can decorate and customize as 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.220
 want the particularity that they have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.890
 these bookmarks is that they maintain the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.350
 closed book and it is impossible for the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.000
 mark book miss if you want to know 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 how are you made that you want to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.790
 Then he explained the step by step of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.790
 how to make them 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 to make the bookmarks or 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 bookmarks we can use for 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 example cardboard of any color 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 We can also use wrapping paper 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 we can make prints on sheets of 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.310
 paper we can also use sheets of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 stamped paper colored elastic band 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.540
 to paste we can use any 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.480
 glue that stick the white glue paper 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.489
 glue on bar this glue that is 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.860
 an adhesive tape that sticks by the two 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 sides or the silicone gun for 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.260
 we'll need a pair of scissors and a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 cutter ruler stickers a pencil 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 colored markers and plastic 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 transparent self-adhesive 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 used to line notebooks and books and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the case of not having the plastic 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.810
 self-adhesive we can use the tape 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.579
 wide adhesive 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.619
 to make the bookmarks we are going to 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.810
 use for hills these are 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.149
 used at school the ideal is 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.220
 choose two different colors or also 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.229
 we can do it with a single color the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.180
 measures of brand books are free 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.119
 I for example this I am going to do with 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.280
 measures of five centimeters by 18 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.049
 centimeters so the first thing I'm going to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.869
 to do is to mark on one of the cardboards 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.030
 those measures and now I'm going to cut with a 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.980
 sharp cutter sharpened by the marks that I've 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.810
 fact 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.080
 for the other color I will mark the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.420
 same 18 cm long and I'm going to mark 4 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.490
 cm wide if they have no cutter there is no 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.310
 no problem just mark with 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 the pencil and cut with the scissors 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.930
 then with an eraser we remove 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.310
 all the pencil marks are now 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 two parts we have to paste between 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 yes for this we can use any 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.250
 glue that stick paper or how I'm going to 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.380
 do I'm going to use this tape 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.380
 self-adhesive that sticks on both sides 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.550
 as you can see the glue I have 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.450
 put only here this part 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.450
 we are not going to hit 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.319
 Y 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.349
 if it stands out to us like it is in this case 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.000
 we are simply going to remove this piece 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.860
 with the scissors and now we can 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.500
 decorating as we want in this case I have 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.959
 cut a strip of paper stamped like 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.209
 you can see here I've also put the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.860
 glue from behind and this I'm going to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.810
 hit from the back and now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.640
 I have this part to decorate it too 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.290
 let's take into account the part that does not 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.379
 we have stuck that would be the part of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.379
 above 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.680
 and we can decorate it with whatever we want 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.569
 in this case I'm going to decorate it with 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.569
 some stickers and some markers 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.580
 I'm going to take advantage of the fact that I have a cardboard 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.350
 over another to pass the marker 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.970
 without help from the rule 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.970
 I also do with the stickers 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520
 Y 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.329
 Y 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.430
 what makes this book different 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.920
 from other brand books that we are going to 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.719
 put rubber band can see here that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.730
 you can get many colors in 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.469
 the haberdasheries and of various widths 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.170
 example the white and black I have 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.230
 here is 5 mm wide and 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.510
 blue and red measure 7 millimeters is not 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.579
 too important more or less well I know 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.609
 for these measures and we are going to cut a 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.739
 strip 36 centimeters long now 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.480
 we take the bookmarks we are going to open it 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.950
 here we put glue 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.169
 preferably with the gun 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.510
 silicone because it dries fast and we're going to 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.209
 put as focused as we can one of 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.720
 the parties and we're going to put another of the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.290
 parts in this way 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.450
 this should remain like this once we 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.540
 have dried that part we are going to finish 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.460
 of putting glue to join everything 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.290
 and to protect the brand books and that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 last us a long time, we will cover it 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.180
 with self-adhesive plastic paper 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.160
 First let's cut a long strip 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.680
 that is a little more than the width 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.960
 bookmark we take off a part and we're going 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.960
 to paste this edge with this edge 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.670
 in this part we cut here flush 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.680
 to adhere well the paper we can 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.340
 help us with a card of these 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.340
 plastic 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.880
 we paste these parts very well and for 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.070
 remove the excess from the sides we can 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.220
 make cutting with the cutter or with the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.220
 scissors 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.340
 in the case of this I have cut two strips 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.710
 of cardboard one of white color one of 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.840
 dark blue color I've pasted some 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.270
 star-shaped stickers I've 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.370
 lined with silver color marker you 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.290
 I have put other stickers with letters 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.450
 forming the word like heap and you're 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.640
 two strips I have put together from behind 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.340
 transparent tape also I have 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.160
 done I cut this strip of another color 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.930
 contrast and that it was a little bit more 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.740
 big and so will follow the same steps 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.740
 previous 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.310
 if we are not good at decorating them 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.710
 we can simplify the work 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.449
 simply printing from the web 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.090
 any message that we like that 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.280
 have an elongated shape can see that 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.409
 I did not print a sheet of paper so 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.960
 just cut it out what I did to the 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.780
 trimming is leaving a blank border 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.210
 I have put the adhesive tape that sticks 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.460
 the two faces and the paper to make it a 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.020
 little more firm I'm going to stick it on top of 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.030
 a cardboard and now I'm going to cut 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.030
 around with a future the scissors 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.169
 now the drawing that we have chosen or the 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.880
 message is stronger I have returned to 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.919
 put the adhesive tape back 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.199
 back remember to leave this part without 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.069
 glue and this we're going to paste it over 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.069
 from another cardboard 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.830
 and as you can see these bookmarks the 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.170
 they can do in many ways in 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.270
 this case is also taken a message 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.400
 of the web post equally stickers 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.260
 on both sides here what I have done 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.020
 is colored black with a marker I 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.240
 written a message equally with the 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.820
 stickers here I used paper of 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.740
 angelitos gift here I have not done 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.720
 many things I have put here an edge with 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.910
 golden color marker and here I have 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.350
 used a cardboard that came 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.060
 Christmas print 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.890
 I just cut him off 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.080
 cut the edges diagonally I've 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.310
 followed the same steps 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.440
 remember that we can do these 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.870
 bookmarks with the measures that we want 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.730
 and in the case that we do it for 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.620
 books thicker than this what 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.290
 we can is add a couple of centimeters 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.960
 to elastic rubber to put them is very 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.729
 simple we put the bookmarks 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.120
 and all we have to do is 

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:02.280
 pass the rubber in this way and so from 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.979
 the book is closed and the 

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.810
 Mark books are not lost I hope that 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:08.669
 have enjoyed today's project and 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.319
 that is very useful now as 

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:12.539
 I always say goodbye I wish you to pass 

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:16.340
 a wonderful day and we'll see each other 

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:16.340
 the next tutorial bye bye
