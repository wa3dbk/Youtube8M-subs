00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.810
 because temporarily they can not 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.850
 not stay in their family near 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.400
 2000 children are entrusted to the department 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.100

 welcomes to his home children who 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.580
 are entrusted to him minor children or 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.880
 children over the age of 21 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.130
 years 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 and for this reception he receives a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.450
 compensation today there are also 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.599
 need skills that need to be 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.880
 worked and so since the law of June 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.130
 2005 who has a training that is 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.579
 mandatory to a training course that makes 300 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.190
 hours 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.350
 so it's a number of hours anyway 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.480
 relatively consistent and which is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 really essential to get well 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.950
 position in this in this business what 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.600
 isabelle craft chose him after 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.300
 several years as an educator 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.730
 a life choice for her for her 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.649
 family also a lifestyle choice that she does not 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.239
 do not regret how does he get to 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.309
 if you're not alone in 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.290
 home so your your husband your 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.280
 kids if you have them and suddenly there 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.659
 everyone must be a stakeholder 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.420
 because it's true that if you have 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.880
 reluctance is not even worth it 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 because it is 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 it's complicated to share 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.670
 house for his own children to share 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.899
 his intimacy shared his wife must 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.270
 always tell yourself that anyway so 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.350
 his children they are at home and we 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.329
 go a long way together 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.130
 that's really the thing and it's 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.289
 we are just a parenthesis in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.909
 their lives so we are investing with them 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.950
 makes sure that they go well that they 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.420
 grow up well but we will be one 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.610
 moment in their lives this Thursday we are 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.350
 not there we are not here to make the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.030
 repair in quotation marks I'm 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.220
 not there to repair game there to help 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 So here we have to focus 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.209
 not too much must find the right distance 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.099
 and the frame the frame it is necessary 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.409
 because I have accounts to render 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.429
 in my way of working in my 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.099
 observations it's a job 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.599
 of reflection observation one works 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.170
 not without a net and we work in a 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.030
 team 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 isabelle has already hosted several 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.649
 siblings so she knew the departures 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.289
 emotionally difficult but the 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.539
 thanks also in both 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.069
 siblings I had and that's right it's 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.209
 very rewarding is when the parent 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.519
 you say you have educate well the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.910
 kids there she does things like that 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.359
 but it's thanks to you I know it's 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.709
 super positive what I'm excited about 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.019
 good it's true it's going to touch me but 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.459
 because I tell myself this has been beyond the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.870
 children because suddenly parents 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.549
 understood the meaning of the placement 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.590
 lack of new vocations for 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.609
 replace retirements this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.549
 welcome mode is today 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.850

 it is now the elected 250 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.480
 general advice so we really 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.400
 reaffirmed really all the interest for 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.530
 this form of placement it's true that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.600
 it is an investment or is warm 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.670
 when we are close to the level of 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.299
 relationships and a stability of yesteryear 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.040
 in relationships 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.900
 so there's the elected ones really have 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.609
