00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379 
but the most dangerous most likely are

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.499 
but the most dangerous most likely are
the<00:07:33.499> lesser<00:07:33.799> demons<00:07:34.159> they<00:07:34.489> can<00:07:34.639> kill<00:07:34.819> a<00:07:35.149> stream

and when we can Franco will be quite a

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:58.240 
and when we can Franco will be quite a
bit<00:07:55.970> further<00:07:56.120> along<00:07:56.419> as<00:07:56.630> pedal<00:07:56.990> and<00:07:57.530> let's

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.250 
bit further along as pedal and let's

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.370 
bit further along as pedal and let's
just<00:07:58.370> split<00:07:58.460> right<00:07:58.639> to<00:07:58.789> finish<00:07:59.120> so<00:07:59.419> this<00:08:00.259> has

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:00.380 
just split right to finish so this has

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.080 
just split right to finish so this has
been<00:08:00.470> heaven's<00:08:00.740> freedom<00:08:01.009> and<00:08:01.220> I<00:08:01.490> don't<00:08:01.849> get
