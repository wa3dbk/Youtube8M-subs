reminds<00:01:17.159> me<00:01:17.310> ciety<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.420> best<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
reminds me ciety of the best way to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
reminds me ciety of the best way to
describe<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> cheat<00:01:21.090> code<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
describe it is there was a cheat code in

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
describe it is there was a cheat code in
in<00:01:22.439> Grand<00:01:22.650> Theft<00:01:22.740> Auto<00:01:23.060> 3<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> was

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
in Grand Theft Auto 3 I think it was

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.300 
in Grand Theft Auto 3 I think it was
where<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> turn<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.130> can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
where you can turn it on and you can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.780 
where you can turn it on and you can
make<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.520> driving<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.900> hard

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
make your driving really really hard

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.950 
make your driving really really hard
hardcore<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.240> you'd<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.570> able<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> turn

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
hardcore like you'd be able to turn

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
hardcore like you'd be able to turn
corners<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.100> super<00:01:32.610> speed<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> like

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
corners at super speed it's kind of like

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
corners at super speed it's kind of like
that<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> slows<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.790> can

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that but it slows down time so you can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.109 
that but it slows down time so you can
you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> effectiveness<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:38.119> while

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you have that effectiveness in while

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
you have that effectiveness in while

two<00:02:22.590> disks<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.520> go<00:02:23.700> about<00:02:23.910> an<00:02:24.090> eight<00:02:24.300> gig

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540

caught<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.790> game<00:04:11.819> but<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.959> my

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
caught up in the game but you get my

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:29.620 
caught up in the game but you get my
drift<00:04:13.340> it's<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.670> very<00:04:14.970> very<00:04:15.269> pretty<00:04:15.750> world

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.590 

take

take

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:43.410 
take
what

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:55.149 

big

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.910 

the<00:04:56.159> game

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.040 

he's<00:05:02.520> switching<00:05:02.790> between<00:05:03.030> three<00:05:03.540> characters

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
he's switching between three characters

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.620 
he's switching between three characters
is<00:05:04.230> so<00:05:04.440> useful<00:05:04.710> because<00:05:05.010> if<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.760> are<00:05:05.970> in<00:05:06.120> you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
is so useful because if you are in you

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.630 
is so useful because if you are in you
know<00:05:06.750> Greg<00:05:06.960> have<00:05:07.110> daughter<00:05:07.290> before<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:08.070> say

you<00:05:08.700> got<00:05:09.180> lost<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.200> blew<00:05:10.470> your<00:05:10.620> car<00:05:10.830> up<00:05:10.950> out

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
you got lost you blew your car up out

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.670 
you got lost you blew your car up out
here<00:05:11.160> you'd<00:05:11.640> be<00:05:11.880> pretty<00:05:12.240> gutted<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.500> had

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
here you'd be pretty gutted that you had

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.980 
here you'd be pretty gutted that you had
to<00:05:13.830> walk<00:05:14.070> all<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:15.000> way<00:05:15.030> back<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.540> road<00:05:15.720> and

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
to walk all the way back to the road and

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.750 
to walk all the way back to the road and
hopefully<00:05:16.200> pick<00:05:16.710> up<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.950> car<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.400> probably<00:05:17.640> be

hopefully pick up a car that probably be

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.420 
hopefully pick up a car that probably be
really<00:05:17.910> slow<00:05:18.410> however<00:05:19.410> there<00:05:19.950> are<00:05:20.070> other<00:05:20.220> ways

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
really slow however there are other ways

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.610 
really slow however there are other ways
of<00:05:20.610> getting<00:05:20.670> around<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.900> as<00:05:22.200> we're<00:05:22.380> about<00:05:22.470> to

into<00:05:25.040> out<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.280> tunnel<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.730> meet<00:05:27.000> up<00:05:27.240> with<00:05:27.270> a

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
into out this tunnel and meet up with a

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.900 
into out this tunnel and meet up with a
train<00:05:28.820> trains<00:05:29.820> obviously<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:31.140> can<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.910> don't

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910

know<00:05:33.000> yet<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.480> will<00:05:33.630> have<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.870> try<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.140> out

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
know yet you will have to try that out

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
point but I don't know about driving

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.070 
point but I don't know about driving
trains<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.000> original<00:05:42.540> one<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.900> could

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
trains and the original one you could

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.700 
trains and the original one you could
drive<00:05:43.230> trains<00:05:43.560> enough<00:05:43.980> i<00:05:44.160> think<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:45.470> for<00:05:46.470> you

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
drive trains enough i think in for you

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.540 
drive trains enough i think in for you
could<00:05:46.860> drive<00:05:47.040> subway<00:05:47.640> trains<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:48.150> believe<00:05:49.550> ugly

could drive subway trains I believe ugly
I<00:05:50.730> believe<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:51.270> could<00:05:52.100> so<00:05:53.100> look<00:05:53.310> at<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.550> view

I believe you could so look at that view
there's<00:05:54.900> some<00:05:55.190> staggering<00:05:56.190> points<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.150> know
