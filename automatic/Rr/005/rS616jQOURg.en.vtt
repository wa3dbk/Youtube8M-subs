and of course wherever you back this up
onto<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.080> need<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:28.619> sure<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.799> there's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

onto you need to make sure that there's
enough<00:01:29.250> space<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.570> can't<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
enough space on there you can't back it

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.830 
enough space on there you can't back it
up<00:01:31.320> onto<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.860> same<00:01:32.130> drive<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.450> are

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
up onto the same drive where you are

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.800 
up onto the same drive where you are
currently<00:01:34.829> trying<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.270> an<00:01:36.420> image<00:01:36.540> from

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
currently trying to make an image from

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
currently trying to make an image from
because<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.439> know<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> drive<00:01:38.040> goes<00:01:38.340> down

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
because you know if that drive goes down

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300 
because you know if that drive goes down
then<00:01:38.970> obviously<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.630> can't<00:01:40.100> restore<00:01:41.100> from

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
then obviously you can't restore from

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
then obviously you can't restore from
that<00:01:41.490> drive<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.299> sure<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> backup<00:01:43.079> your

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that drive so make sure you backup your

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
that drive so make sure you backup your
system<00:01:43.770> image<00:01:44.040> onto<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.460> different<00:01:44.729> drive<00:01:45.299> okay

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
system image onto a different drive okay

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710 
system image onto a different drive okay

one<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.540> system<00:02:37.290> image<00:02:37.650> recovery<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> one

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
one is system image recovery so that one

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300 
one is system image recovery so that one
basically<00:02:39.269> would<00:02:39.510> ask<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.739> drive

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
basically would ask you for your drive

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580 
basically would ask you for your drive
where<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.670> backed<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:43.019> case<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.440> would

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
where you backed up in my case I would

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.190 
where you backed up in my case I would
have<00:02:43.620> backed<00:02:43.860> up<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.129> 71<00:02:44.640> gig<00:02:44.879> system<00:02:45.630> image<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
have backed up a 71 gig system image and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.530 
have backed up a 71 gig system image and
it<00:02:46.709> would<00:02:46.829> ask<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.760> location<00:02:48.239> for<00:02:48.420> that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it would ask for the location for that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.270 
it would ask for the location for that
it<00:02:48.720> would<00:02:48.780> find<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.560> take<00:02:49.890> its<00:02:50.040> time

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it would find it and then take its time

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.100 
it would find it and then take its time
of<00:02:50.430> course<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> restore<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> whole<00:02:51.810> thing

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
of course to restore the whole thing

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.309 
of course to restore the whole thing
back<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:53.489> that's<00:02:54.209> basically<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.780> safety

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
back so that's basically a safety

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.289 
back so that's basically a safety
precaution<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.950> case<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:56.910> wondering

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
precaution in case you you're wondering

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.020 
precaution in case you you're wondering
how<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> do<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.200> quick<00:02:58.890> video<00:02:59.190> hope<00:02:59.879> you
