00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.229

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.330

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.180

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.549
 wog grace coddington magazine editor 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.549
 absolutely incredible woman who 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.740
 was born forty- two and practically 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.710
 devoted her whole life to fashion 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.320
 at first she was a model and then already 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.030
 became a stylist stylists first 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.120
 English magazine could then already 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.550
 american fascinating book 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.730
 absolutely absolutely amazing with her 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.890
 very bright cover and it doesn't seem that 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.690
 the cover directly conveys the mood of this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.200
 books you read right on 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.960
 refuse each line positive not 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.320
 knowing the love of fashion 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.869
 iru and somehow you get all this idea 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.340
 there is an insane amount 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.840
 famous characters you will discover for 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.650
 yourself a lot of new and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.750
 and know how the shooting took place 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.880
 as they were before when it was necessary 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.170
 long wait for some particular 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.250
 sunset or some definite know 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.979

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.409
 because there was no photoshop and shooting 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.080
 flew off a literal week fascinating 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.350
 very interesting endlessly advise you 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.030
 read think that we really like 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.709
 another book which of course is not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.720
 I can not say it of course 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.150
 Helmut Newton's autobiography this 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.269
 I found a book in the studio by Oleg Zotov well 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.890
 so the model is interesting that it is Oleg very 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.320
 surprised, in principle, did not read such 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.620
 the book naturally said that here is an urgent 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.380

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.549
 huge amount of useful information 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.829
 naturally maybe this will help you 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.030
 a little more to understand the general creativity 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.950

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.049
 of that era to that world like this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.750
 happened then you can emphasize 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.880
 lots of interesting ideas completely 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.160

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.530
 Helmut Newton is there 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.959
 one of these pillars of modern 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.820
 art can definitely be called 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.459
 his ancestor erotic 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.150
 photo on the page of your modern 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.100
 magazines it was he who was the man 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.430
 which here first became that way 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.609
 shoot models of course the book is very 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.459
 many stories about editors about him 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.769
 intractable with these editions about 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.650
 model about interesting faces will give 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.450
 how he worked and how he worked 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.670
 of course you can be inspired by a huge 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.930
 number of ideas to emphasize get infected 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.940
 charge and of course a lot in general 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.050

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.640

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.780
 you can feel the spirit so directly 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.250
 I suggest you read 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.740
