00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
motorcycles just amazing performance

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.439 
motorcycles just amazing performance
both<00:00:21.180> acceleration<00:00:22.170> braking<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:24.000> really

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
both acceleration braking and really

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.880 
both acceleration braking and really
just<00:00:25.320> incredible<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> non<00:00:28.410> 80s

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
just incredible this is the non 80s

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470 
just incredible this is the non 80s
version<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.820> versions<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
version we make two versions of this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
version we make two versions of this
bike<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:31.019> ABS<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.800> any<00:00:31.949> lock<00:00:32.189> brakes<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
bike with ABS or any lock brakes and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.450 
bike with ABS or any lock brakes and
without<00:00:33.090> any<00:00:33.360> lock<00:00:33.570> brakes<00:00:33.870> both<00:00:34.739> models<00:00:35.280> have

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
without any lock brakes both models have

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.160 
without any lock brakes both models have
traction<00:00:35.730> control<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.540> bike<00:00:36.719> does<00:00:36.989> have

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
traction control so this bike does have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.880 
traction control so this bike does have
traction<00:00:37.440> control<00:00:37.790> but<00:00:38.790> no<00:00:38.969> ABS<00:00:42.649> has<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
traction control but no ABS has the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.330 
traction control but no ABS has the
inverted<00:00:44.489> forks<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> show<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.710> big

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
inverted forks so it has to show up big

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
inverted forks so it has to show up big
piston<00:00:47.850> fork<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.230> kind<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> new

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
piston fork and that is kind of a new

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.200 
piston fork and that is kind of a new
fork<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.280> Showa<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.879> market

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
fork from Showa it's been on the market

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
fork from Showa it's been on the market
now<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> few<00:00:55.770> years<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now for for a few years but it's the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
now for for a few years but it's the
first<00:00:56.879> time<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.300> used<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:58.010> thousand

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
first time we've used it on our thousand

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
first time we've used it on our thousand
CC<00:00:59.129> sport<00:00:59.579> bikes<00:00:59.760> you've<00:00:59.969> been<00:01:00.090> using<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
CC sport bikes you've been using on the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.349 
CC sport bikes you've been using on the
zx6r<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.489> great<00:01:02.699> new<00:01:02.850> fork<00:01:03.120> kind

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
zx6r and it's just a great new fork kind

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.429 
zx6r and it's just a great new fork kind
of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> latest<00:01:03.780> technology<00:01:06.110> because<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> old

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
of the latest technology because the old

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
of the latest technology because the old
steering<00:01:08.040> damper<00:01:10.220> see<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.369> inverted<00:01:11.820> front

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
steering damper see your inverted front

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
steering damper see your inverted front
fork<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.799> basically<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
fork right here and basically what that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.359 
fork right here and basically what that
inverted<00:01:14.970> front<00:01:15.299> fork<00:01:15.600> means<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.290> that

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
inverted front fork means is that

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
inverted front fork means is that
instead<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> having<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.180> part<00:01:18.630> clamped

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
instead of having the two part clamped

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
instead of having the two part clamped
in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> triple<00:01:20.130> clamps<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.610> high<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
in the triple clamps up high the the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740 
in the triple clamps up high the the
heavy<00:01:22.770> part<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> transferred<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.570> does

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
heavy part here is transferred it does

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.289 
heavy part here is transferred it does
it<00:01:24.960> makes<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> force<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.830> rigid<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.520> there's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it makes the force more rigid so there's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
it makes the force more rigid so there's
less<00:01:27.479> flex<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.170> forks<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
less flex in the forks this way so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
less flex in the forks this way so
that's<00:01:30.090> why<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:30.869> amber<00:01:31.200> Grand

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that's why we use those amber Grand

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.230 
that's why we use those amber Grand

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
calipers these there's a Pistons brake
piston<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.750> brake<00:01:39.990> piston<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> then

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
piston here a brake piston here and then

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.580 
piston here a brake piston here and then
on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.430> side<00:01:41.479> there's<00:01:42.479> another<00:01:42.540> piston

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
on the back side there's another piston

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.230 
on the back side there's another piston
sometimes<00:01:45.340> if<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.549> look<00:01:45.700> on<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.909> back<00:01:46.060> of

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
sometimes if you look on the back of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.940 
sometimes if you look on the back of
these<00:01:46.299> brake<00:01:46.540> pads<00:01:46.570> these<00:01:47.200> brake<00:01:47.500> calipers

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
these brake pads these brake calipers

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.649 
these brake pads these brake calipers
you'll<00:01:48.100> see<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> brake<00:01:48.520> pad<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.390> then<00:01:49.509> you'll

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
you'll see a brake pad and then you'll

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.649 
you'll see a brake pad and then you'll
know<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.899> only<00:01:50.049> has<00:01:50.320> two<00:01:50.649> pistons<00:01:51.130> but<00:01:51.310> because

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
know it only has two pistons but because

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.330 
know it only has two pistons but because
the<00:01:52.659> fact<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.110> can<00:01:53.259> see<00:01:53.470> that's<00:01:53.829> closed

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
the fact you can see that's closed

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.700 
the fact you can see that's closed
there's<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.880> piston<00:01:55.329> there<00:01:55.509> has<00:01:56.049> two<00:01:56.229> Pistons

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
there's a piston there has two Pistons

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.340 
there's a piston there has two Pistons
over<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.100> back<00:01:57.310> side<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.479> front<00:01:58.600> side<00:01:58.899> and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
over the back side on the front side and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.620 
over the back side on the front side and
it<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.740> squeezes<00:02:00.310> from<00:02:00.490> both<00:02:00.670> sides<00:02:01.000> and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it really squeezes from both sides and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.039 
it really squeezes from both sides and
then<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.929> has<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.259> peddle<00:02:02.590> style<00:02:02.890> rotors<00:02:03.369> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
then it has the peddle style rotors and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.279 
then it has the peddle style rotors and
these<00:02:05.049> will<00:02:05.320> cuts<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.759> road<00:02:06.970> or<00:02:07.210> allow<00:02:08.019> for

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
these will cuts in the road or allow for

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.290 
these will cuts in the road or allow for
more<00:02:08.500> surface<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.950> dissipate<00:02:09.550> heat<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:10.239> do

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
more surface to dissipate heat how do

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
more surface to dissipate heat how do
the<00:02:10.599> past<00:02:10.869> do<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.230> holes<00:02:11.440> drilled<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.190> so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the past do the holes drilled in it so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.800 
the past do the holes drilled in it so
that's<00:02:12.819> why<00:02:12.940> they're<00:02:13.120> drilled<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.660> just

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
that's why they're drilled for just

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.580 
that's why they're drilled for just
maybe<00:02:15.269> three<00:02:16.269> spoke<00:02:16.569> wheels<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.290> little

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
maybe three spoke wheels a little

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.660 
maybe three spoke wheels a little
different<00:02:17.920> from<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.310> were<00:02:18.459> using

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
different from what we were using

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.620

previously mm this bike is basically the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.440 
previously mm this bike is basically the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
same as the 2011 Sears ten are just some

here<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.280> if<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.580> look<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.970> other<00:02:43.150> side

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
here and if we look at this other side

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.979 
here and if we look at this other side
that<00:02:45.040> caliper<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:46.060> can<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.480> brake<00:02:46.720> pads

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
that caliper you can see the brake pads

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.640 
that caliper you can see the brake pads
there<00:02:47.349> there's<00:02:48.310> no<00:02:48.810> no<00:02:49.810> piston<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.380> that's<00:02:50.530> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
there there's no no piston so that's a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.930 
there there's no no piston so that's a
single<00:02:50.980> piston<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.430> course<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
single piston but of course all you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.430 
single piston but of course all you
stopping<00:02:52.359> power<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.959> front<00:02:53.230> because

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
stopping power is in the front because

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.370 
stopping power is in the front because
we<00:02:53.650> use<00:02:53.920> your<00:02:54.040> brakes<00:02:54.540> weight<00:02:55.540> shift<00:02:56.049> into<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
we use your brakes weight shift into the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.720 
we use your brakes weight shift into the
front<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:56.829> that's<00:02:56.920> why<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.310> those<00:02:57.459> big

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
front so that's why you have those big

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.470 
front so that's why you have those big
four<00:02:58.690> piston<00:02:59.140> dual<00:02:59.350> piston<00:02:59.829> calipers<00:03:00.480> front

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.849 
four piston dual piston calipers front
you're<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.959> single<00:03:02.170> piston<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
you're just a single piston in the

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.710 
you're just a single piston in the
bathroom<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.609> that's<00:03:04.510> where<00:03:04.630> all<00:03:04.660> your

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
bathroom because that's where all your

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.770 
bathroom because that's where all your
stopping<00:03:05.079> power<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.850> these<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:07.060> adjustable

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
stopping power is these have adjustable

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.550 
stopping power is these have adjustable
footrest<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.430> pegs<00:03:09.700> arm<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.989> they're

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
footrest the pegs arm you can they're

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.559 
footrest the pegs arm you can they're
set<00:03:11.799> here<00:03:12.040> at<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> higher<00:03:12.400> position<00:03:13.000> but

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
set here at the higher position but

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.900 
set here at the higher position but
there's<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.810> hole<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.739> here<00:03:15.040> move<00:03:15.639> down

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
there's a hole here and here move down

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.960 
there's a hole here and here move down
and<00:03:16.060> lose<00:03:16.209> those<00:03:16.359> down<00:03:16.600> fifteen<00:03:17.170> millimeters

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and lose those down fifteen millimeters

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.910 
and lose those down fifteen millimeters
so<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.269> adjust<00:03:19.600> those<00:03:19.780> down<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.620> makes<00:03:20.799> it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
so you can adjust those down it makes it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.199 
so you can adjust those down it makes it
a<00:03:20.950> little<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.220> comfortable<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.760> personally

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
a little more comfortable I personally

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.449 
a little more comfortable I personally
own<00:03:22.359> one<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.569> these<00:03:22.720> bikes<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.889> lowered<00:03:24.250> my

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
own one of these bikes and I lowered my

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.940 
own one of these bikes and I lowered my
most<00:03:24.850> ado<00:03:25.090> street<00:03:25.389> riding<00:03:25.780> by<00:03:26.470> lowering<00:03:26.829> them

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
most ado street riding by lowering them

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.110 
most ado street riding by lowering them
you<00:03:27.130> do<00:03:27.250> lose<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> little<00:03:27.760> bit<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:27.940> ground

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
you do lose a little bit of ground

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.879 
you do lose a little bit of ground
clearance<00:03:28.450> as<00:03:28.870> far<00:03:29.019> as<00:03:29.109> dragging<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> pegs

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
clearance as far as dragging the pegs

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.280 
clearance as far as dragging the pegs
but<00:03:30.760> there's<00:03:30.880> not<00:03:31.000> much<00:03:31.180> chance<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.600> me<00:03:32.139> doing

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
but there's not much chance of me doing

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.190 
but there's not much chance of me doing
that<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.889> street<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.959> see<00:03:35.079> your

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
that on the street so you see your

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.660 
that on the street so you see your
coolant<00:03:35.500> reservoirs<00:03:36.040> right<00:03:36.250> here<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.489> we

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
coolant reservoirs right here if we

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.280 
coolant reservoirs right here if we
check<00:03:36.940> your<00:03:37.060> coolant<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:37.840> got<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> sight

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
check your coolant it's got a sight

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.930 
check your coolant it's got a sight
window<00:03:38.680> right<00:03:39.069> here<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.430> when<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:39.579> check<00:03:39.760> your

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
window right here so when you check your

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.569 
window right here so when you check your
oil<00:03:40.560> these<00:03:41.560> are<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:41.829> cassette<00:03:42.340> type

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579
