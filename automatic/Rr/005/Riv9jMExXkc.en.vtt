piece of you know you want to you want
to<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.770> sure<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> doesn't<00:00:38.219> spill<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.460> yeah<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to make sure it doesn't spill out yeah I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
to make sure it doesn't spill out yeah I
had<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> cut<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.260> piece<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> comb<00:00:41.040> off

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
had to cut this little piece of comb off

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
had to cut this little piece of comb off
because<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> bees<00:00:41.879> were<00:00:42.350> building<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
because the bees were building it out of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.029 
because the bees were building it out of
order<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.520> bars<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
order on the bars and so what this is is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
order on the bars and so what this is is
nectar<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.989> from<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
nectar this is what they get from the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
nectar this is what they get from the
flowers<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.719> I<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.300> once<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
flowers and all and I think that once it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.639 
flowers and all and I think that once it
of<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.840> don't<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.590> think

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of that I don't really know but I think

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
of that I don't really know but I think
it<00:00:55.860> has<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> evaporate<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it has to evaporate more and then the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
it has to evaporate more and then the
bees<00:00:57.390> cap<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> becomes<00:00:58.500> honey<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
bees cap it and then it becomes honey so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
bees cap it and then it becomes honey so
right<00:00:59.670> now<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> lot<00:01:01.289> more

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
right now it's I think just a lot more

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.390 
right now it's I think just a lot more
liquidy<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.609> quite<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:04.100> not<00:01:05.100> quite<00:01:05.220> as

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
liquidy and not quite as not quite as

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
liquidy and not quite as not quite as
thick<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> save<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.530> for
