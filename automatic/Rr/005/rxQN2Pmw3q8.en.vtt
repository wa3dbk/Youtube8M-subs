the<00:00:00.149> next<00:00:00.420> reference<00:00:00.570> points<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.170> you've<00:00:01.290> got

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
the next reference points so you've got

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.370 
the next reference points so you've got
the<00:00:01.560> shoulder<00:00:01.920> staying<00:00:02.159> close<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.460> contact

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
the shoulder staying close to contact

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
the shoulder staying close to contact
just<00:00:04.380> like<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> forehand<00:00:05.400> when<00:00:06.060> I'm<00:00:06.180> doing

just like on the forehand when I'm doing
a<00:00:06.569> forehand<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> ball<00:00:08.340> goes<00:00:08.610> long

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
a forehand and I and the ball goes long

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.580 
a forehand and I and the ball goes long

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
or if I'm trying to hit an angle I'm

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.440 
or if I'm trying to hit an angle I'm
going<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.160> go<00:00:11.400> up<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.849> I'm<00:00:11.940> gonna<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.210> back

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
going to go up and I'm gonna get back

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.620 
going to go up and I'm gonna get back
down<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.410> number<00:00:13.620> three<00:00:13.920> sooner<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.120> shape<00:00:15.450> of

and<00:00:21.150> back<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.720> sooner<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.410> longer<00:00:22.650> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and back down the sooner I the longer I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.080 
and back down the sooner I the longer I
go<00:00:22.859> up<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> longer<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> ball<00:00:23.640> goes<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:23.939> the

go up the longer the ball goes up the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.310 
go up the longer the ball goes up the
sooner<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.510> down<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> sooner<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> ball

sooner I get down the sooner the ball

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.420 
sooner I get down the sooner the ball
drops<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> other<00:00:25.890> side<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.189> same

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
drops on the other side it's the same

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.910 
drops on the other side it's the same
thing<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> serve<00:00:27.410> except<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.680> using

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
thing on the serve except we're using

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
thing on the serve except we're using
honor<00:00:29.279> deviation<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.269> number<00:00:30.510> three<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
honor deviation as our number three to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
honor deviation as our number three to
bring<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> ball<00:00:32.009> down<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
bring the ball down and so again that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.340 
bring the ball down and so again that
motion<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:35.000> here<00:00:36.000> here's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> honor<00:00:36.870> bone<00:00:37.170> I'm

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
motion is here here's the honor bone I'm

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
motion is here here's the honor bone I'm
going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> break<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> wrist<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.640> pinky

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
going to break the wrist my pinky

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540 
going to break the wrist my pinky
directly<00:00:39.629> towards<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.170> honor<00:00:40.379> bone<00:00:40.680> okay<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
directly towards my honor bone okay and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.440 
directly towards my honor bone okay and
so<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.800> good<00:00:43.800> drill<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> practice<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> last

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so a good drill to practice so that last

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
so a good drill to practice so that last
reference<00:00:45.840> point<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> snap

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
reference point is you're going to snap

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
reference point is you're going to snap
the<00:00:48.629> wrist<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.110> cause<00:00:49.379> snap<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the wrist you can cause snap you can

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
the wrist you can cause snap you can
call<00:00:50.160> own<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:50.399> deviate<00:00:50.789> flex<00:00:51.180> whatever<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
call own or deviate flex whatever you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.139 
call own or deviate flex whatever you
want<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.930> we're<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.309> snap<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> wrist

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
want to do we're going to snap the wrist

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.439 
want to do we're going to snap the wrist
sooner<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.890> typically<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.300> like

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sooner then we typically did just like

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
sooner then we typically did just like
we<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> forehand<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> bring<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> down

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we would on a forehand to bring it down

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
we would on a forehand to bring it down
because<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> ball<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> drop<00:01:00.090> shorter

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
because we want the ball to drop shorter

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.260 
because we want the ball to drop shorter
in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> box<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> ball<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> go

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
in the box so we want the ball to go

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
in the box so we want the ball to go
over<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> hit<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.860> snaps

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
over we want to hit up and think snaps

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.060 
over we want to hit up and think snaps
quicker<00:01:05.970> than<00:01:06.299> normal<00:01:06.600> hit<00:01:07.170> swing<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
quicker than normal hit swing up and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
quicker than normal hit swing up and
snap<00:01:08.340> sooner<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.390> normally<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.930> because

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
snap sooner than we normally do because

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.719 
snap sooner than we normally do because
we<00:01:10.500> want<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> ball<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> drop<00:01:11.189> sooner<00:01:11.490> because

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we want the ball to drop sooner because

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
we want the ball to drop sooner because
we're<00:01:12.420> hitting<00:01:12.570> shorter<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> box<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
we're hitting shorter into the box and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.830 
we're hitting shorter into the box and
so<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:14.549> show<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.330> drill

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so let's show you just a little drill

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
so let's show you just a little drill
you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.590> she's<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.040> her

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you can just and now she's got on her

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.530 
you can just and now she's got on her
mind<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> basically<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> she's<00:01:18.390> gonna

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
mind this is basically it she's gonna

toss far to the left she's gonna swing

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
toss far to the left she's gonna swing

court a great drill you can do which
we're<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.490> she's<00:01:44.970> simply

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
we're going to do right now she's simply

we're going to do right now she's simply
going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> reverse<00:01:46.229> engineer<00:01:46.470> she's<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.070> to

going to reverse engineer she's going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060 
going to reverse engineer she's going to
aim<00:01:47.280> further<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.720> short<00:01:49.170> than

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
aim further to the right in short than

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
aim further to the right in short than
she<00:01:50.220> normally<00:01:50.369> would<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.119> she's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
she normally would so she's going to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
she normally would so she's going to
actually<00:01:51.810> aim<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> alley<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> see

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
actually aim for the alley so you see

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
actually aim for the alley so you see
the<00:01:54.270> coach<00:01:54.479> he's<00:01:54.720> gonna<00:01:54.899> try<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.049> aim<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> the

the coach he's gonna try to aim to the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.050 
the coach he's gonna try to aim to the
right<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> comb<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> alley<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
right of the comb but in the alley and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
right of the comb but in the alley and
then<00:01:57.570> start<00:01:58.140> developing<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.920> timing<00:01:59.369> hit<00:01:59.610> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
then start developing the timing hit up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
then start developing the timing hit up
just<00:02:00.149> enough<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> net<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> find<00:02:00.990> it

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
just enough get on the net and find it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
just enough get on the net and find it
until<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.829> starts<00:02:02.040> dropping<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.610> the

until it starts dropping in with the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
until it starts dropping in with the
snapping<00:02:03.149> sooner<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> go<00:02:04.500> shorter

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
snapping sooner and make it go shorter

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
snapping sooner and make it go shorter
and<00:02:04.920> shorter<00:02:04.950> shorter<00:02:05.369> till<00:02:05.520> she<00:02:05.700> hit<00:02:05.850> meets

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and shorter shorter till she hit meets

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.950 
and shorter shorter till she hit meets
her<00:02:06.149> target<00:02:06.509> let's<00:02:07.140> try

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.200 

good<00:02:11.960> good

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
good good

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.520 
good good
should<00:02:14.210> do<00:02:14.570> one<00:02:14.720> more<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.960> those<00:02:17.170> now<00:02:18.170> get<00:02:18.380> your

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
should do one more of those now get your

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.500 
should do one more of those now get your
weight<00:02:18.710> towards<00:02:19.130> your<00:02:19.220> target<00:02:24.310> good<00:02:25.310> now<00:02:26.240> from

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
weight towards your target good now from

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.270 
weight towards your target good now from
there<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:27.080> start<00:02:27.320> bringing<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:27.920> snap<00:02:28.250> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
there just start bringing it in snap a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.250 
there just start bringing it in snap a
little<00:02:28.490> sooner<00:02:31.390> good<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.750> almost<00:02:33.050> that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
little sooner good that was almost that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.350 
little sooner good that was almost that
was<00:02:33.410> closer<00:02:33.710> now<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.160> same<00:02:34.520> target<00:02:35.060> snap<00:02:35.330> a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
was closer now the same target snap a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.770 
was closer now the same target snap a
little<00:02:35.600> sooner<00:02:35.780> than<00:02:35.920> incremental<00:02:36.920> e<00:02:37.780> there

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
little sooner than incremental e there

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.320 
little sooner than incremental e there
you<00:02:38.990> go<00:02:39.170> almost<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.010> over<00:02:40.220> adjusted<00:02:40.700> it's

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
you go almost so you over adjusted it's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.760 
you go almost so you over adjusted it's
okay<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.440> hit<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.880> left<00:02:43.880> or<00:02:44.030> right<00:02:44.410> good<00:02:45.410> that's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
okay so hit up left or right good that's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.470 
okay so hit up left or right good that's
all<00:02:45.980> miss<00:02:46.130> that's<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.520> two<00:02:46.670> inches<00:02:46.970> out

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
all miss that's like two inches out

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.260 
all miss that's like two inches out
so<00:02:47.990> snap<00:02:48.200> same<00:02:48.680> exact<00:02:49.220> up<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> ball<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
so snap same exact up on the ball and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.040 
so snap same exact up on the ball and
just<00:02:50.560> snap<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> fraction<00:02:52.220> almost<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.930> get

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
just snap a fraction almost you just get

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.430 
just snap a fraction almost you just get
