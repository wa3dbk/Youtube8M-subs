this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.560> second<00:00:01.979> attempt<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.870> video<00:00:03.870> in

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
this is my second attempt at a video in

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.210 
this is my second attempt at a video in
the<00:00:04.980> daytime<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.700> my<00:00:05.879> new<00:00:06.180> potty<00:00:06.480> boost<00:00:06.810> gauge

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
the daytime of my new potty boost gauge

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.240 
the daytime of my new potty boost gauge
got<00:00:08.220> an<00:00:08.429> email<00:00:08.670> from<00:00:08.910> Winston<00:00:09.719> who<00:00:10.040> saw<00:00:11.040> my

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
got an email from Winston who saw my

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.259 
got an email from Winston who saw my
video<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.880> noted<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:13.429> my<00:00:14.429> installers<00:00:15.030> had

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
video and noted that my installers had

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.050 
video and noted that my installers had
gotten<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> wiring<00:00:16.560> slightly<00:00:16.949> wrong<00:00:17.160> which

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
gotten the wiring slightly wrong which

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.370 
gotten the wiring slightly wrong which
caused<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.840> delay<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.760> startup<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
caused a delay and the startup of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.349 
caused a delay and the startup of the
boost<00:00:22.859> gaygent<00:00:23.580> could<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.570> damaged<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
boost gaygent could have damaged the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.979 
boost gaygent could have damaged the
boost<00:00:27.359> cinder<00:00:28.160> in<00:00:29.160> any<00:00:29.340> event<00:00:31.669> here's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.360> video

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
boost cinder in any event here's a video

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.310 
boost cinder in any event here's a video
of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> startup<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.090> again<00:00:36.090> looking<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
of the startup now again looking at the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
of the startup now again looking at the
gauge<00:00:37.700> high<00:00:38.700> quality<00:00:39.559> ice<00:00:40.760> silver<00:00:41.760> bezel

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
gauge high quality ice silver bezel

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
gauge high quality ice silver bezel
around<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> gauge<00:00:43.230> itself<00:00:43.590> matches<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
around the gauge itself matches with the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090 
around the gauge itself matches with the
OEM<00:00:44.670> gauges<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:46.110> needle<00:00:46.440> color<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.829> very

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
OEM gauges the needle color is very

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
OEM gauges the needle color is very
close<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.969> dead-on

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
close if not dead-on

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
close if not dead-on
you'll<00:00:50.640> notice<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.110> due<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> fact<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you'll notice that due to the fact that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.270 
you'll notice that due to the fact that
the<00:00:52.860> gauge<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.579> under<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.410> dash<00:00:55.410> cowling

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the gauge is not under the dash cowling

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.660 
the gauge is not under the dash cowling
there<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.180> doesn't<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> shade<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:59.489> gets<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
there it doesn't get the shade it gets a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
there it doesn't get the shade it gets a
little<00:00:59.730> bit<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.090> than<00:01:00.300> ambient<00:01:00.750> light<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
little bit more than ambient light on it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
little bit more than ambient light on it
so<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.739> may<00:01:01.920> appear<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.789> bit

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so it may appear to be a little bit

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.080 
so it may appear to be a little bit
lighter<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> case

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
lighter but that's actually not the case

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:15.880 
lighter but that's actually not the case
in<00:01:06.090> any<00:01:06.240> event<00:01:06.659> let's<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.189> start<00:01:08.580> up

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.490 

you'll<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:18.290> even<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you'll see that the even with the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.429 
you'll see that the even with the
corrected<00:01:19.890> wiring<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> boost<00:01:22.170> gauge

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
corrected wiring it's the boost gauge
