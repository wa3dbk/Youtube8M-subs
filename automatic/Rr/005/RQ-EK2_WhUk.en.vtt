00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.599 
deck and I think the Dudley neighborhood
is<00:00:49.300> very<00:00:49.390> distinct<00:00:50.350> because<00:00:50.949> it's<00:00:51.280> such<00:00:51.579> a

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
is very distinct because it's such a

00:00:51.609 --> 00:01:01.109

the<00:03:31.300> difference<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:31.810> not<00:03:31.870> take<00:03:32.110> everybody

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
the difference it's not take everybody

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.490 
the difference it's not take everybody
we<00:03:33.340> come<00:03:33.700> from<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.000> same<00:03:34.150> place<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:35.170> this

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
we come from the same place and this

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.100 
we come from the same place and this
it's<00:03:35.920> centralized<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.850> community<00:03:37.270> so<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
it's centralized in the community so the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.320 
it's centralized in the community so the
people<00:03:38.470> feel<00:03:38.770> you<00:03:39.460> know<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.820> sense<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
people feel you know a sense of

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.290 
people feel you know a sense of
ownership<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.530> work<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.160> with<00:03:42.310> kids<00:03:42.370> can

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
ownership the work you do with kids can

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.110 
ownership the work you do with kids can
really<00:03:43.660> change<00:03:44.170> communities<00:03:44.920> beyond<00:03:45.670> what

really change communities beyond what
kids<00:03:46.420> learn<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.140> classroom<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:48.220> think

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
kids learn in the classroom and I think

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.060 
kids learn in the classroom and I think
with<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.790> piece<00:03:49.600> too

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
with that piece too

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.970 
with that piece too
there's<00:03:51.400> really<00:03:51.640> no<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.590> there's<00:03:53.830> no

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
there's really no and there's no

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.809 
there's really no and there's no
stopping<00:03:54.250> us
