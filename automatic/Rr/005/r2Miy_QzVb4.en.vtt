change in terms of a process then this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.240 
change in terms of a process then this

can help them to step back and reflect

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.510 
can help them to step back and reflect
and<00:01:10.790> think<00:01:10.820> what's<00:01:11.540> going<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.520> identify

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
and think what's going on and identify

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.700 
and think what's going on and identify
what<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.810> they've<00:01:14.960> done<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.409> may<00:01:15.649> or

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
what it is that they've done that may or

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.469 
what it is that they've done that may or
may<00:01:15.860> not<00:01:15.890> have<00:01:16.190> worked<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.000> think<00:01:17.180> about

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
may not have worked and to think about

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.639 
may not have worked and to think about
what<00:01:17.840> they<00:01:17.990> can<00:01:18.170> do<00:01:18.320> next<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:20.649> essentially

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
what they can do next so essentially

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.999 
what they can do next so essentially
that's<00:01:21.860> what<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.100> try<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.460> do<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:23.149> teaching<00:01:24.009> the

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
that's what I try and do in teaching the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.919 
that's what I try and do in teaching the
reality<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.610> you're<00:01:26.090> confronted<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:26.780> a

reality is you're confronted with a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.690 
reality is you're confronted with a
problem<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.710> you've<00:01:27.800> got<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.100> what<00:01:28.580> do

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
problem and you've got to think what do

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.820 
problem and you've got to think what do
I<00:01:28.759> do<00:01:28.850> next<00:01:29.119> we've<00:01:30.020> got<00:01:30.200> changes<00:01:30.710> in

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
I do next we've got changes in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.190 
I do next we've got changes in
regulations<00:01:31.220> we've<00:01:31.880> got<00:01:32.030> changes<00:01:32.539> in<00:01:32.660> markets

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200

we've<00:01:33.470> got<00:01:33.619> changes<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> nature<00:01:34.490> of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
we've got changes in the nature of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.719 
we've got changes in the nature of
competition<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:36.200> got<00:01:36.350> changes<00:01:37.070> all<00:01:37.250> round

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
competition and we got changes all round

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.150

and<00:01:38.000> what's<00:01:38.780> really<00:01:39.259> really<00:01:39.560> important<00:01:40.009> is

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
and what's really really important is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.050 
and what's really really important is
that<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:41.360> people<00:01:41.600> learn<00:01:42.440> how<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.070> recognize

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
that the people learn how to recognize

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.180 
that the people learn how to recognize
what's<00:01:44.840> happening<00:01:45.259> what<00:01:45.619> are<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.860> threats

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
what's happening what are the threats

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.490 
what's happening what are the threats
what<00:01:46.759> are<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.970> opportunities<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:48.320> can

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
what are the opportunities and what can

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
what are the opportunities and what can
they<00:01:48.649> do<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.890> respond<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.000> exploit

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
they do to respond to and exploit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.330 
they do to respond to and exploit
opportunities<00:01:50.659> or<00:01:51.440> manage<00:01:52.039> threats

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
opportunities or manage threats

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.730 
opportunities or manage threats
effectively<00:01:53.000> if<00:01:53.149> we<00:01:53.479> get<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.929> right<00:01:54.200> then

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
effectively if we get that right then

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.070 
effectively if we get that right then
hopefully<00:01:55.420> organizations<00:01:56.420> will<00:01:56.659> perform

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
hopefully organizations will perform

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.530 
hopefully organizations will perform
more<00:01:57.259> effectively<00:02:00.670> before<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.700> chose<00:02:02.509> this

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
more effectively before I chose this

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.450 
more effectively before I chose this
program<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.530> made<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.829> thorough<00:02:04.220> investigation

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
on the NBA market and I chose this

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.810 
on the NBA market and I chose this
specific<00:02:08.570> program<00:02:09.440> because<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:09.950> would<00:02:10.579> give

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
specific program because it would give

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.460 
specific program because it would give
me<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.060> newest<00:02:11.480> knowledge<00:02:11.840> within<00:02:12.079> the
