have a we can't angle the patient is
angled<00:00:14.429> back<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.089> far<00:00:15.389> forward

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
angled back and this is as far forward

as<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.230> down<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.830> he<00:00:17.010> got

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
as we can get this down here what he got

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.150 
as we can get this down here what he got
his<00:00:17.340> patient<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:18.660> sit<00:00:18.810> down<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.770> get

him and then the patient is able to lean
forward<00:00:34.520> which<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.820> interesting<00:00:36.680> so

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
forward which was really interesting so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.860 
forward which was really interesting so
yeah<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.600> for

actor so what some of the things that
were<00:00:46.020> positive<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.640> okay<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
were positive about using that okay you

were positive about using that okay you
can<00:00:48.860> your<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.579> stop<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> action<00:00:51.000> per

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
can your you can stop the action per

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.569 
can your you can stop the action per
second<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.050> dental<00:00:52.350> chair<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.340> allows<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
second the dental chair is it allows the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
second the dental chair is it allows the
patient<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> fully<00:00:54.449> support<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
patient to fully support and actually I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
patient to fully support and actually I
have<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> clip<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> end<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> pay<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
have a clip at the end of the pay of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
have a clip at the end of the pay of
this<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> patients<00:00:58.620> saying<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.100> sort

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
this with the patients saying that sort

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
this with the patients saying that sort
of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> benefits<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.050> technique<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
of the benefits of this technique so the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.990 
of the benefits of this technique so the
patient<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.129> able<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.550> his<00:01:02.640> feet<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
patient is able to put his feet on the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
patient is able to put his feet on the
floor<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> side<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
floor you can do this on the side the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
floor you can do this on the side the
dental<00:01:05.189> chair<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.640> thinking<00:01:05.939> about<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
dental chair I was thinking about that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
dental chair I was thinking about that
but<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.439> gives<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.710> more

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
but this just gives a little more

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.760 
but this just gives a little more
control<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.320> important<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.439> well<00:01:10.650> because

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
control and important as well because

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
control and important as well because
this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.310> important<00:01:11.760> step<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> basis

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this is an important step it's the basis

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
this is an important step it's the basis
and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> redo<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and you don't want to have to redo this

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.670 
and you don't want to have to redo this
once<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> done<00:01:15.240> once<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
once you get it done once you want to do

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.130 
once you get it done once you want to do
it<00:01:16.799> properly<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.600> some<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> things<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it properly so some of the things you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.460 
it properly so some of the things you
need<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.890> rehearse<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> alginate

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
need to do is rehearse with the alginate

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
need to do is rehearse with the alginate
tray<00:01:22.830> make<00:01:23.610> sure<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> patient<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.420> aware<00:01:24.630> make

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
tray make sure the patient is aware make
