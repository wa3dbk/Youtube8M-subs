00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
will notice in a moment that I dropped

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.020

some extra HTML tags in just to make it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.720 
some extra HTML tags in just to make it
look<00:02:57.930> right<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.919> it's<00:02:59.129> not<00:02:59.219> like<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.459> would<00:02:59.639> do

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
look right so it's not like I would do

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.470 
look right so it's not like I would do
that<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.689> there's<00:03:01.139> an<00:03:01.349> article<00:03:01.620> title<00:03:02.480> then

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
that so there's an article title then

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.869

up<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.790> paragraphs<00:03:18.419> so<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.049> its<00:03:19.169> paces<00:03:19.680> out

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
up the paragraphs so that its paces out

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.490 
up the paragraphs so that its paces out
properly<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.359> not<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.720> big<00:03:21.959> job<00:03:22.290> when

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
properly it's really not a big job when

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.619 
properly it's really not a big job when
you're<00:03:22.620> copying<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.159> pasting<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.970> drop<00:03:24.449> all

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
you've got an article like this one

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.839 
you've got an article like this one
which<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.299> particularly<00:03:42.840> about<00:03:43.109> script<00:03:43.849> I've

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
which is particularly about script I've

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.749 
which is particularly about script I've
added<00:03:45.479> some<00:03:45.629> script<00:03:46.590> words<00:03:47.280> into<00:03:47.729> the

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
added some script words into the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.080 
added some script words into the
keywords<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.500> once<00:03:50.069> again<00:03:50.250> copied

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
keywords of that and once again copied

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.270 
keywords of that and once again copied
and<00:03:51.180> posted<00:03:51.329> logical<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:52.829> run

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
and posted logical in and then run

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.490 
and posted logical in and then run
through<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.030> drop<00:03:54.389> these<00:03:54.540> BR<00:03:54.930> tags<00:03:55.259> in

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
through and just drop these BR tags in

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.550 
through and just drop these BR tags in
very<00:03:55.769> quickly<00:03:56.359> so<00:03:57.359> let's<00:03:58.169> just<00:03:58.379> go<00:03:58.439> through

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
very quickly so let's just go through

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.039 
very quickly so let's just go through
this<00:03:59.040> does<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.489> for<00:03:59.930> 10<00:04:00.930> articles<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.780> let's

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
this does this for 10 articles so let's

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.789 
this does this for 10 articles so let's
dive<00:04:04.500> through<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:06.079> that<00:04:07.079> might<00:04:07.259> seem<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.620> lot

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
dive through that that might seem a lot

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.800 
dive through that that might seem a lot
but<00:04:08.009> it<00:04:08.099> really<00:04:08.430> doesn't<00:04:08.759> take<00:04:08.879> more<00:04:09.569> than<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
but it really doesn't take more than a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.379 
but it really doesn't take more than a
few<00:04:09.840> minutes<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.650> think<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.849> built<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.180> whole

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
few minutes I think I built this whole

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.039 
few minutes I think I built this whole
sorry<00:04:12.689> in<00:04:13.019> about<00:04:13.349> 10-15<00:04:14.159> minutes<00:04:14.759> max<00:04:15.060> because

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
sorry in about 10-15 minutes max because

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.550 
sorry in about 10-15 minutes max because
it<00:04:16.289> really<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.889> just<00:04:16.919> copying<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.729> pasting

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
it really is just copying and pasting

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.110 
it really is just copying and pasting
then<00:04:19.560> you've<00:04:19.709> got<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.859> description<00:04:20.279> for<00:04:20.969> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
then you've got a description for the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600 
then you've got a description for the
headline<00:04:21.510> section<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.620> site<00:04:23.039> there's<00:04:23.520> a

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
ok and on this one you have a nice BN

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.920 
ok and on this one you have a nice BN
number<00:06:13.530> so<00:06:13.830> you<00:06:13.920> will<00:06:14.070> find<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.550> ASI<00:06:15.060> n<00:06:15.270> there

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
number so you will find the ASI n there

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
number so you will find the ASI n there
and<00:06:16.320> it's<00:06:16.950> actually<00:06:17.040> labeled<00:06:17.520> at<00:06:17.610> ASI<00:06:18.030> n<00:06:18.950> so

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
and it's actually labeled at ASI n so

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.410 
and it's actually labeled at ASI n so
you<00:06:20.010> just<00:06:20.250> take<00:06:20.430> those<00:06:20.460> across<00:06:20.880> you<00:06:21.240> can

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
you just take those across you can

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.970 
you just take those across you can
abbreviate<00:06:21.720> these<00:06:22.170> titles<00:06:22.560> down<00:06:22.770> when<00:06:22.920> you

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
abbreviate these titles down when you

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.290 
abbreviate these titles down when you
get<00:06:23.070> when<00:06:23.250> I<00:06:23.280> really<00:06:23.580> long<00:06:23.760> like<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:23.970> you

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
get when I really long like that you

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.960

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
might want to chop them down a bit so in

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.020 
might want to chop them down a bit so in
the<00:06:27.090> case<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.300> that<00:06:27.630> one<00:06:27.870> I've<00:06:28.170> only<00:06:28.410> put<00:06:29.030> cell

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
the case of that one I've only put cell

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.680 
the case of that one I've only put cell
