 Speak there Gurizada do youtube Welcome to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.500
 jonas channel one game 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'm here today bringing a boxing of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 a video card that I bought good I 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 had bought an x650 agent from zotac 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:39.270
 nvidia then got tired of nvidia and where until 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 and that's the r7 260 x that's right 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:54.860
 how can you see 3d hd today? 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 11.2 overclock in which it was collor 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.500
 I think it's very pretty on the mark. 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.290
 time of the four videos he is good here 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 we have here speaking that it 128 bits in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 support for the model named 5.0 and the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.180
 directx 1.2 here above us 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.040
 finds that the power and the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 system required application 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 system for her 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 was 500 places which shows a land 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:41.840
 of 3 acceleration technology with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.420
 two speaks that the gcn architecture 28 and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 amd google 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.049
 Ok, let's go to the things that interest us. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.820
 rock had already shone she walks to see 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.580
 if it had come to be accurate and how it arrived 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.950
 it 's very good here 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.610
 the shelter here is to use another machine not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 fulfilled 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.270
 and here the guy was playing a find 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.570
 Little here for the box. 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.260
 I found this box very 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:30.780
 the flash that shows 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:33.860
 that hold three of everyone at home to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.940
 people find the video card 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.980
 Wrapped in bubble wrap protection 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.890
 room 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:49.040
 ronnie von 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:53.310
 down here on the other hand now again 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:59.960
 here down people against some until 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:06.890
 there and some 7th show here now 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.890
 we have the installation CD 1 which is the color 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.330
 nobody uses wheels 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.920
 here we also have a user manual 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.720
 or glue also no one uses the most 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.790
 impressive is that it comes with a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.930
 adapter should govern the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.390
 Aunt White is that they have white 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.320
 be white white even until beautiful 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.590
 but there is a 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:04:04.470
 For me the gtx 650 I had this 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:04:07.800
 separate adapter and even the baby and 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.400
 I think I do not remember well and this is 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.049
 another shock to see I do not think 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.340
 to see very well that anything the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:25.520
 boto nobody gives a picture of the inscription 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.520
 good pomegranate that interests the door 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:40.210
 this video card as soon as there 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:43.599
 here we have plastic for 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:48.789
 protect that part that needs a 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:58.930
 very interesting metal because we have 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:05:03.750
 hdmi guti entries to see this here is 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:09.639
 The hot air comes out hot 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:15.129
 that concierge went that way 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.110
 good folks this still 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:22.479
 I just wanted to show the door a new video. 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:24.520
 I bought and also talk because I did not 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.370
 is not having videos on the channel yet 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.159
 again because I was without a 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:37.569
 video such hope that you reach first 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:38.919
 the other to buy and I after 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.449
 send a box 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:46.469
 the flight is a gameplay against the stark 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.839
 Goal with a friend of mine 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:52.180
 Now you'll see who it is. 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:55.810
 I think it's until now 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:00.569
 and I also want to see how this 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.569
 beauty here behaves now 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.319
 It's good that you liked the video is to evaluate the 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.120
 icann did not like or disliked her 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:21.110
 part and many thanks to whoever watched 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.110
