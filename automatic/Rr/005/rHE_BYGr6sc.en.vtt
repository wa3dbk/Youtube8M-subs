00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
we were talking we would say it was the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.790 
we were talking we would say it was the
thoroughbred<00:00:40.600> breeding<00:00:40.900> capital<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.650> the

thoroughbred breeding capital of the
world<00:00:42.040> what's<00:00:42.879> exciting<00:00:43.210> now<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.140> we<00:00:44.290> are

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
world what's exciting now is that we are

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.590 
world what's exciting now is that we are
saying<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.070> I<00:00:45.250> think<00:00:45.640> quite<00:00:45.790> rightly<00:00:45.940> we're

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
saying and I think quite rightly we're

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.060 
saying and I think quite rightly we're
saying<00:00:46.840> with<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.050> horse<00:00:47.290> capital<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.890> world

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
saying with a horse capital of the world

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.610 
saying with a horse capital of the world
the<00:00:48.550> world<00:00:48.790> respects<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.170> respects

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
the world respects that and it respects

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.640 
the world respects that and it respects
it<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.920> think<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:52.030> way<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.449> lends<00:00:52.840> itself<00:00:53.350> to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
it I think in a way that lends itself to

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.860 
it I think in a way that lends itself to
being<00:00:53.890> named<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.580> host<00:00:55.120> city<00:00:55.330> for<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.660> world

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
being named the host city for the world

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.410 
being named the host city for the world
equestrian<00:00:56.559> games<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:57.879> think<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.239> reason

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
equestrian games and I think the reason

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.209 
equestrian games and I think the reason
we've<00:00:58.719> gone<00:00:58.930> for<00:00:59.170> being<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.800> thoroughbred

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
we've gone for being the thoroughbred

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.950 
we've gone for being the thoroughbred
breeding<00:01:00.520> capital<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> world<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.660> the
