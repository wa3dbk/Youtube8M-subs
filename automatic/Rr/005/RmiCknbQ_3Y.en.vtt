00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
process when my design really just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.190 
process when my design really just
starts<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.790> what<00:00:38.790> inspires<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
starts with what inspires me and that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.889 
starts with what inspires me and that
could<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.770> anything<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.550> be

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
could really be anything it could be

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.830 
could really be anything it could be
anything<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.820> see<00:00:44.820> around<00:00:44.940> me<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
anything from what I see around me or it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
anything from what I see around me or it
could<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.620> event<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:47.940> emotion

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
could be an event it could be an emotion

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
could be an event it could be an emotion
it<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> anything<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.230> usually<00:00:50.100> when

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it could be anything so usually when

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
it could be anything so usually when
once<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.510> figure<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.230> my

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
once I kind of figure out what my

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
once I kind of figure out what my
inspiration<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.270> start<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> build

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
inspiration is then I now start to build

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
inspiration is then I now start to build
on<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.489> sort<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
on it and you know you sort of take it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.500 
on it and you know you sort of take it
further<00:00:57.590> usually<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.739> sketches<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.940> try<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
further usually I do sketches I try to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
further usually I do sketches I try to
find<00:01:00.809> things<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.530> related<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
find things that are related to it and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
find things that are related to it and
you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> start<00:01:03.780> thinking

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you know and then I start thinking

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
you know and then I start thinking
through<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.379> color<00:01:04.650> schemes<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.580> stuff

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
through my color schemes you know stuff

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
through my color schemes you know stuff
putting<00:01:05.909> everything<00:01:06.180> down<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.659> paper<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
putting everything down on paper and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
putting everything down on paper and
then<00:01:07.710> eventually<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.549> start<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> actually

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
then eventually I start to actually

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530 
then eventually I start to actually
design<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> pieces<00:01:10.970> what<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> love<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> most

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
design the pieces what I love the most

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.380 
design the pieces what I love the most
about<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.770> finished<00:01:14.390> product

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
about what I do is the finished product

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
about what I do is the finished product
or<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> finished<00:01:16.140> result<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:17.189> terms<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
or the finished result in terms of the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120 
or the finished result in terms of the
styling<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> designing<00:01:19.409> usually<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
styling with the designing usually it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
styling with the designing usually it
starts<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.520> an<00:01:20.610> idea<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
starts with an idea you really just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.359 
starts with an idea you really just
start<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.320> something<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
start with something that is just a

start with something that is just a
thought<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> head<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
thought in your head and then when you
