00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.040
 superman today we have a review on the mouse 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.839
 which I literally recently acquired 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 called the mouse and pictures good in 3 or 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.460
 Gondry is still somehow not exactly called 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 I remember, and so here we are on this side 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.070
 title and futek 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.260
 here permission any nonsense means here 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 firing modes 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.360
 here I am showing you too how is she like 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 there everything bends well here the same thing 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.550
 in different languages, the principle is the mouse itself 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.320
 and so now I will set up a little and show 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 so mouse 199 rubles that's the way it is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.329
 It looks very cool and so while I'm 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 I will unpack I will tell you that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.920
 what does the mouse cost us 999 rubles or 90 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 990 is just 990 rubles without 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 activated card mode this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 Especially such a core costs but 600 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.869
 rubles 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.869
 You can buy it online at 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.450
 I did not buy them on the taln site 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.159
 so if you want to know how her 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 hack is that common in the comments i 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.979
 sure to tell you and did not pay 600 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 rubles and so here I am now pulling out 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.479
 the wire itself is how to choose mice 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 correctly you need to put your hand on the mouse and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.130
 that's when your hand drops 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 Grip he will talk about everything that is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.659
 if you put your hand and your hand will be 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 Here you look, I'll show you now. 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.840
 if you put your hand on the mouse she 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.790
 should not lie completely she should not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.070
 in contact with the surfaces of the fact at 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.369
 nowhere do I have everything 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.780
 OK, that is, the mouse is working 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.659
 lovely 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.820
 and as if for me she is direct to herself 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.470
 so here we have the keys, let me 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.369
 now 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.430
 I will also connect the optical here 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.260
 that is, as you remember, there was a ball 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.060
 which recognized the movement of the mouse 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 Then the laser is already in my optics 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.360
 the mouse is very good surface 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.270
 soft-touch three toggle buttons 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.569
 modes is 1n and at one means 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.750
 ordinary 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.140
 usually mouse mode n means double 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.440
 cry 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.420
 3 triple click sideways also have buttons 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.510
 switch back and forth page in 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.959
 on the internet here now i will connect 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.930
 mouse and see how it glows here 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.739
 by the way these buttons 123 they also change 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.530
 and even the color of your mouse's my look 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.500
 red green and yellow was red 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.180
 5 i.e. modes change and color together 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.310
 it changes with them very much 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.140
 cool very comfortable following everything 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.540
 buy in principle, thank you all 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.540
 good luck to everyone all bye and see you soon
