00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
very well and so now we're just I guess

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.360 
very well and so now we're just I guess
getting<00:03:35.019> used<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.590> little<00:03:35.859> bit<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.340> know

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420
