00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090 

in<00:00:00.089> this<00:00:01.020> clip<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.500> going<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.709> be<00:00:01.860> talking

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in this clip we're going to be talking

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.579 
in this clip we're going to be talking
about<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.730> writing<00:00:03.179> steps<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.259> guess<00:00:04.410> it's

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
about the writing steps and I guess it's

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.829 
about the writing steps and I guess it's
like<00:00:04.799> if<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.700> paint<00:00:05.970> something<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.509> want<00:00:06.720> to

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
like if you paint something you want to

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.059 
like if you paint something you want to
get<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.500> point<00:00:07.740> where<00:00:07.890> you're<00:00:08.040> just

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
get to the point where you're just

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.830 
get to the point where you're just
painting<00:00:08.700> without<00:00:08.820> thinking<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.690> it's

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
painting without thinking of it and it's

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
painting without thinking of it and it's
just<00:00:10.080> flowing<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.429> beginning<00:00:11.550> you're

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
just flowing but in the beginning you're

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.209 
just flowing but in the beginning you're
thinking<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.450> each<00:00:12.889> individual<00:00:13.889> color

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
thinking about each individual color

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039 
thinking about each individual color
each<00:00:14.429> individual<00:00:15.089> brush<00:00:15.299> your<00:00:15.540> brush<00:00:15.719> stroke

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
each individual brush your brush stroke

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
each individual brush your brush stroke
and<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> same<00:00:17.039> thing<00:00:17.539> with<00:00:18.539> writing

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and it's the same thing with writing

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.570 
and it's the same thing with writing
really<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> kind<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.220> break<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
really we're going to kind of break it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
really we're going to kind of break it
down<00:00:20.730> into<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> component<00:00:21.689> parts<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.289> then

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
down into the component parts and then

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.700 
down into the component parts and then
after<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.289> have<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> back

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
after that you can have it in the back

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
after that you can have it in the back
your<00:00:25.920> mind<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.369> fly<00:00:26.580> forward<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
your mind and fly forward with it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
your mind and fly forward with it
now<00:00:28.050> there<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.320> four<00:00:28.619> basic<00:00:29.130> steps<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
now there are four basic steps to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
now there are four basic steps to
writing<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.949> in

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
writing and you can do them really in

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.709 
writing and you can do them really in
any<00:00:32.279> order<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.239> shouldn't<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
any order and it shouldn't be a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
any order and it shouldn't be a
structured<00:00:34.350> regimented<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.610> should<00:00:36.090> be

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
structured regimented thing it should be

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
structured regimented thing it should be
something<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> back<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.010> your

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
something that is in the back of your

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.470 
something that is in the back of your
mind<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.550> something<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> you're

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
mind and just something that you're

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
mind and just something that you're
aware<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.700> step<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.329> research<00:00:43.820> now

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
aware of the first step is research now

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
aware of the first step is research now
the<00:00:45.239> second<00:00:45.690> step<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.219> writing<00:00:48.050> then<00:00:49.050> editing

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the second step is writing then editing

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
the second step is writing then editing
and<00:00:50.090> then<00:00:51.090> rewriting<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and then rewriting and then you kind of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
and then rewriting and then you kind of
keep<00:00:54.840> repeating<00:00:55.230> those<00:00:56.070> steps<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.670> go

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
keep repeating those steps as you go

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.360 
keep repeating those steps as you go
along<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.480> addition<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> I've<00:00:58.649> broken<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
along in addition to that I've broken a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.619 
along in addition to that I've broken a
couple<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> steps<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
couple of the steps down a little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.340 
couple of the steps down a little
further<00:01:01.609> research<00:01:02.609> actually<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.899> comes<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
further research actually to me comes in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
further research actually to me comes in
two<00:01:04.979> different<00:01:05.010> parts<00:01:05.519> there's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> research

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
two different parts there's a research

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
two different parts there's a research
you<00:01:07.020> need<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:07.920> beginning<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you need to do at the very beginning to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
you need to do at the very beginning to
see<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> proceed<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.200> doing

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
see if you want to proceed with doing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940 
see if you want to proceed with doing
this<00:01:11.010> play<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.930> also<00:01:12.930> everything<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.740> need

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this play and also everything you need

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.880 
this play and also everything you need
in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.610> background<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.229> started<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
in the background to get you started and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670 
in the background to get you started and
going<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.900> there's<00:01:18.900> another<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
going on it there's another kind of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.490 
going on it there's another kind of
research<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.759> smaller<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.990> detailed

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
research which is smaller more detailed

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.330 
research which is smaller more detailed
research<00:01:23.009> along<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> way<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:25.380> might<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.220> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
research along the way it might be to do

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100 
research along the way it might be to do
with<00:01:26.460> certain<00:01:26.820> characters<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.479> certain<00:01:27.810> dress

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
with certain characters or certain dress

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859 
with certain characters or certain dress
or<00:01:28.439> certain<00:01:28.979> again<00:01:29.549> details<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.720> think

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
or certain again details and I think

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
or certain again details and I think
it's<00:01:30.990> important<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.920> off<00:01:32.070> doing<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it's important to start off doing the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's important to start off doing the
basic<00:01:33.000> research<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
basic research you need to do to get the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
basic research you need to do to get the
play<00:01:35.549> started<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> try<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> do

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
play started because if you try to do

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
play started because if you try to do
every<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> research<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> whole<00:01:38.700> play

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
every bit of research in the whole play

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960 
every bit of research in the whole play
you<00:01:39.990> might<00:01:40.500> burn<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.950> before<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> even<00:01:41.430> start

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you might burn out before you even start

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.760 
you might burn out before you even start
so<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.420> something<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.259> one

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so that's something to think about one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
so that's something to think about one
example<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.430> dividing<00:01:44.939> research<00:01:45.570> into<00:01:45.840> two

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
example of dividing research into two

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
example of dividing research into two
parts<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.310> play<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.790> wrote<00:01:47.880> Potter's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
parts is the play that I wrote Potter's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.740 
parts is the play that I wrote Potter's
point<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.320> setting<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.600> monument<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
point the setting was a monument on the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
point the setting was a monument on the
top<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.259> hill<00:01:52.409> overlooking<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> ocean

top of the hill overlooking the ocean
that<00:01:53.490> had<00:01:53.640> been<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> hundred<00:01:54.210> years

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that had been there for a hundred years

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649 
that had been there for a hundred years
it<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.680> important<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> research<00:01:56.729> different

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it was important to research different

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.709 
it was important to research different
monuments<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.770> coastlines<00:01:59.759> especially<00:02:00.479> and

monuments on coastlines especially and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
see what what there was there what sort

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
see what what there was there what sort
of<00:02:03.509> maybe<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:04.049> had<00:02:04.200> plaques<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:04.890> had<00:02:05.040> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
fence in the front just physically what

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.220

was there and and then backgrounds of
them

them
how<00:02:13.500> long<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.860> lasted<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.550> happened<00:02:14.970> why

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
how long they lasted what happened why

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.900 
how long they lasted what happened why
some<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:16.020> closed<00:02:16.380> down<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.890> type<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.580> thing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
some got closed down that type of thing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.120 
some got closed down that type of thing
and<00:02:18.090> those<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.810> needed<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.350> before<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.740> really

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and those I needed to do before I really

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.770 
and those I needed to do before I really
knew<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.580> wanted<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.910> proceed<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.630> the

knew that I wanted to proceed with the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.490 
knew that I wanted to proceed with the
play<00:02:22.100> now<00:02:23.100> later<00:02:23.540> came<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.810> other<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.410> of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
play now later came the other kind of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.960 
play now later came the other kind of
research<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.430> more<00:02:26.610> detailed

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
research which is the more detailed

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.890 
research which is the more detailed
researched<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.810> had<00:02:28.260> two<00:02:28.440> characters<00:02:28.920> who

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
researched I had two characters who

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.120 
researched I had two characters who
started<00:02:30.900> meeting<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.560> historical

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
started meeting up at this historical

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340 
started meeting up at this historical
potters<00:02:32.490> point<00:02:32.850> right<00:02:33.450> after<00:02:33.600> World<00:02:33.930> War<00:02:34.020> two

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
potters point right after World War two

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.980 
potters point right after World War two
and<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:35.160> met<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:35.670> every<00:02:36.120> single<00:02:36.390> week<00:02:36.630> so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and they met there every single week so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.720 
and they met there every single week so
some<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.890> things<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.460> talk<00:02:38.700> about

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
some of the things they would talk about

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.060 
some of the things they would talk about
regarding<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> war<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.320> regarding<00:02:40.950> that

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
regarding the war and regarding that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.730 
regarding the war and regarding that
time<00:02:41.310> period<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.810> could<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.290> along<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
time period so that I could do along the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.530 
time period so that I could do along the
way<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.100> didn't<00:02:44.400> bog<00:02:44.700> myself<00:02:45.150> down<00:02:45.330> at<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
way so I didn't bog myself down at the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
way so I didn't bog myself down at the
very<00:02:45.750> beginning<00:02:45.930> also<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.190> writing<00:02:47.490> process

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
very beginning also the writing process

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.550 
very beginning also the writing process
itself<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.840> broken<00:02:49.260> into<00:02:49.590> two<00:02:50.250> parts<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:51.480> part

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
itself is broken into two parts one part

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.690 
itself is broken into two parts one part
which<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.590> probably<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> most<00:02:53.250> important

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
which is probably the most important

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.210 
which is probably the most important
part<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.940> writing<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.590> creative<00:02:56.190> part

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
part of writing is the creative part

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.900 
part of writing is the creative part
which<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.790> not<00:02:57.560> necessarily<00:02:58.580> typing<00:02:59.580> into<00:02:59.880> the

which is not necessarily typing into the

which is not necessarily typing into the
computer<00:03:00.510> but<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.320> thinking<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> idea

you're sitting in front of your computer

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.630 
you're sitting in front of your computer
just<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.420> whole<00:03:21.660> creative<00:03:22.260> writing<00:03:22.860> process

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
just that whole creative writing process

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.729 
just that whole creative writing process
and<00:03:23.670> figuring<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.989> characters<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> what

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
and figuring out the characters and what

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
and figuring out the characters and what
kind<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.100> conflict<00:03:26.670> they're<00:03:27.120> going<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.330> be

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
kind of conflict they're going to be

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
kind of conflict they're going to be
going<00:03:27.660> through<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.200> then<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.830> other<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.280> of

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
going through and then the other part of

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.600 
going through and then the other part of
writing<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.060> simply<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.900> input<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.550> the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
writing is simply the input one of the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.250 
writing is simply the input one of the
reasons<00:03:32.910> for<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.300> dividing<00:03:33.810> these<00:03:33.930> four

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
reasons for really dividing these four

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.860 
reasons for really dividing these four
points<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.360> trouble<00:03:36.690> if

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
points is that you can get in trouble if

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
points is that you can get in trouble if
you<00:03:37.050> start<00:03:37.410> doing<00:03:37.650> all<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.040> these<00:03:38.550> together

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
you start doing all of these together

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.880 
you start doing all of these together
you're<00:03:39.750> doing<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.050> little<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.530> research

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
you're doing a little bit of research

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.410 
you're doing a little bit of research
you're<00:03:41.190> thinking<00:03:41.550> up<00:03:41.700> some<00:03:41.880> ideas<00:03:42.239> you're

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
you're thinking up some ideas you're

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.390 
you're thinking up some ideas you're
inputting<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:43.080> you're<00:03:43.680> doing<00:03:43.890> some<00:03:44.220> editing

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
inputting it you're doing some editing

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.490 
inputting it you're doing some editing
while<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.910> go<00:03:45.060> along<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.660> kind<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.989> rewriting

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
while you go along and kind of rewriting

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.850 
while you go along and kind of rewriting
in<00:03:46.800> your<00:03:47.400> mind<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.140> then<00:03:49.140> you'll<00:03:49.410> start<00:03:49.800> to

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
in your mind and then you'll start to

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.150 
in your mind and then you'll start to
get<00:03:50.100> bogged<00:03:50.430> down<00:03:50.640> possibly<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.410> again

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
get bogged down possibly so again

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.470 
get bogged down possibly so again
whatever<00:03:53.489> works<00:03:53.820> for<00:03:53.970> you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
whatever works for you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.610 
whatever works for you
is<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.080> process<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:56.040> go<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.780> think<00:03:58.440> a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
is the process to go with but I think a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500 
is the process to go with but I think a
good<00:03:58.920> rule<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.160> thumb<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.550> when<00:04:00.000> you're<00:04:00.209> doing

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
good rule of thumb is when you're doing

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.229 
good rule of thumb is when you're doing
writing<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.260> especially<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:02.040> putting<00:04:02.459> you're

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
writing and especially in putting you're

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.270 
writing and especially in putting you're
finally<00:04:03.660> ready<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.200> put<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.860> down<00:04:05.100> on

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
finally ready to put all this down on

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.220 
finally ready to put all this down on
paper<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:06.209> don't<00:04:06.239> want<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.570> stop<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.110> do

and a word there that can all come in

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.220 
and a word there that can all come in
editing<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.790> get<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.269> laid<00:04:15.630> out<00:04:15.870> there

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
editing so just get it laid out there

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.720 
editing so just get it laid out there
and<00:04:16.440> then<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.919> might<00:04:17.100> want<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.400> jump<00:04:17.669> right

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
and then you might want to jump right

and then you might want to jump right
into<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.359> edit<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.230> might<00:04:19.380> want<00:04:19.590> to

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
into it and edit it you might want to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.680 
into it and edit it you might want to

put it away for a couple days and think

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.480 
put it away for a couple days and think
about<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.049> before<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.470> edit<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.220> whatever

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
about it before you edit it but whatever

about it before you edit it but whatever
you<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.910> those<00:04:24.660> steps<00:04:24.690> are<00:04:25.169> often

good<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.740> separate<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> little<00:04:27.460> bit<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:27.940> then

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
good to separate a little bit and then

now<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.740> know<00:04:42.040> these<00:04:42.250> steps<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.150> they

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
now you know these steps and that they
