hi this is Dan Moskowitz in this video
will<00:00:16.029> show<00:00:16.059> off<00:00:16.359> our<00:00:16.510> new<00:00:16.689> simulation<00:00:17.320> engine

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
will show off our new simulation engine

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.499 
will show off our new simulation engine
glass<00:00:17.980> box<00:00:18.279> and<00:00:18.580> how<00:00:18.759> we're<00:00:18.939> using<00:00:18.970> it<00:00:19.360> to

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
glass box and how we're using it to

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.510 
glass box and how we're using it to
simulate<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.110> basic<00:00:20.470> economic<00:00:21.009> loop<00:00:21.220> between

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
simulate the basic economic loop between

residential industrial and commercial

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.109 
residential industrial and commercial
buildings<00:00:23.829> keep<00:00:24.460> in<00:00:24.610> mind<00:00:24.640> that<00:00:25.000> this

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
buildings keep in mind that this

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.089 
buildings keep in mind that this
demonstration<00:00:25.660> is<00:00:25.900> showing<00:00:26.230> off<00:00:26.380> simulation

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
demonstration is showing off simulation

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.760 
demonstration is showing off simulation
behavior<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.730> not<00:00:27.939> graphics<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.529> here<00:00:29.680> I've

behavior and not graphics so here I've
got<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:29.980> small<00:00:30.340> town<00:00:30.579> that<00:00:30.790> I<00:00:30.880> built<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:32.529> has<00:00:32.710> a

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
got a small town that I built it has a

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.560 
got a small town that I built it has a
pretty<00:00:33.370> small<00:00:33.610> residential<00:00:34.059> neighborhood

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
pretty small residential neighborhood

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.350 
pretty small residential neighborhood
and<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.829> block<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.280> industrial<00:00:36.760> buildings<00:00:37.120> over

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
and a block of industrial buildings over

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.869 
and a block of industrial buildings over
here<00:00:37.629> it's<00:00:38.350> almost<00:00:38.620> 6am<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.280> my<00:00:39.399> city<00:00:39.640> and

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
here it's almost 6am in my city and

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.310 
here it's almost 6am in my city and
that's<00:00:40.270> when<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.480> industrial<00:00:40.989> buildings

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
that's when the industrial buildings

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.200 
that's when the industrial buildings
turn<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:41.950> for<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.219> day<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.850> first<00:00:43.059> thing

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
turn on for the day the first thing

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.819 
turn on for the day the first thing
their<00:00:43.360> rules<00:00:43.570> do<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.140> tell<00:00:44.469> them<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.739> they

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
their rules do is tell them that they

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.110 
their rules do is tell them that they
don't<00:00:44.980> have<00:00:45.039> any<00:00:45.219> workers<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:45.760> they<00:00:45.789> need<00:00:45.999> to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
don't have any workers so they need to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720 
don't have any workers so they need to
send<00:00:46.239> out<00:00:46.449> some<00:00:46.690> help<00:00:46.929> wanted<00:00:47.289> requests<00:00:47.949> these

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
send out some help wanted requests these

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.220 
send out some help wanted requests these
are<00:00:48.940> agents<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.510> are<00:00:49.570> invisible<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:50.079> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
goods

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.749 

the<00:01:20.990> rules<00:01:21.259> that<00:01:21.350> produce<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.100> goods<00:01:22.220> are<00:01:22.579> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
the rules that produce the goods are the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.190 
the rules that produce the goods are the
same<00:01:22.939> rules<00:01:23.149> that<00:01:23.329> produce<00:01:23.689> air<00:01:24.049> pollution

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
same rules that produce air pollution

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.480 
same rules that produce air pollution
the<00:01:27.200> simulation<00:01:27.710> rules<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.130> create<00:01:28.369> the

the simulation rules that create the
goods<00:01:28.700> are<00:01:28.909> also<00:01:29.060> creating<00:01:29.509> air<00:01:29.630> pollution

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
goods are also creating air pollution

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.910 
goods are also creating air pollution
here<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:32.330> see<00:01:32.539> buildings<00:01:33.200> writing<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.799> air

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
here we see buildings writing to the air

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.130 
here we see buildings writing to the air
pollution<00:01:34.340> map<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.780> same<00:01:35.930> rule

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
pollution map and it's the same rule

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.289 
pollution map and it's the same rule
that<00:01:36.320> triggers<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.830> smoke<00:01:37.039> effect<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.610> here

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
that triggers the smoke effect and here

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.889 
that triggers the smoke effect and here
we<00:01:38.390> see<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.570> debug<00:01:38.899> visualization<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.679> that<00:01:39.860> map
