juggling these fields around out there

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.550 
juggling these fields around out there
so<00:01:55.000> poised<00:01:55.240> sometimes<00:01:55.750> use<00:01:56.049> these<00:01:56.229> they<00:01:56.380> keep

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
so poised sometimes use these they keep

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.749 
so poised sometimes use these they keep
one<00:01:56.770> out<00:01:56.979> they<00:01:57.130> because<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:57.429> generally

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
one out they because that's generally

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.120 
one out they because that's generally
where<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.539> can<00:01:58.689> take<00:01:58.840> your<00:01:58.869> catch<00:01:59.200> about

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
where you can take your catch about

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.320 
where you can take your catch about
there<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.490> I'll<00:02:00.580> probably<00:02:00.700> tied<00:02:01.030> at<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
there and I'll probably tied at that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.910 
there and I'll probably tied at that
area<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.990> they<00:02:02.080> leave<00:02:02.229> someone<00:02:02.530> out<00:02:02.619> they<00:02:02.770> just

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
area so they leave someone out they just
