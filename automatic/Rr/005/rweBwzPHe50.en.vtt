00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
as I say you talk about making there's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
as I say you talk about making there's
1%<00:00:18.779> differences<00:00:19.560> as<00:00:19.710> 5%<00:00:19.980> difference<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
1% differences as 5% difference it's a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
1% differences as 5% difference it's a
team<00:00:21.119> performance<00:00:21.689> well<00:00:21.990> that's<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> type<00:00:23.039> of

you've got to prepare properly off the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.020 
you've got to prepare properly off the
pitch<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.810> by<00:00:31.529> using<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.040> product<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.940> get

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
every little gain that we can whether

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.770 
every little gain that we can whether
that<00:00:34.560> be<00:00:34.680> hydration<00:00:35.310> or<00:00:35.550> strength<00:00:36.330> support

before a session then they just get us

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
before a session then they just get us
in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> best<00:00:41.910> possible<00:00:42.270> place<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.630> don't

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
in the best possible place to don't

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
in the best possible place to don't
before<00:00:43.410> my<00:00:43.560> skills<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.220> what<00:00:44.400> it's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
before my skills which is what it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.200 
before my skills which is what it's
about<00:00:45.740> we<00:00:46.740> train<00:00:46.980> harder<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:47.610> now<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:48.090> we

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
about we train harder as well now so we

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
about we train harder as well now so we
need<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> recover<00:00:49.590> better<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.340> need

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
need we need to recover better we need

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
need we need to recover better we need
to<00:00:50.580> be<00:00:50.670> better<00:00:50.880> hydrated<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.540> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> middle

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to be better hydrated out in the middle

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.270 
to be better hydrated out in the middle
I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.620> products<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.040> shown<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I think the products have shown a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
I think the products have shown a
massive<00:00:53.850> increase<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.450> for<00:00:54.660> us<00:00:54.720> getting

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
massive increase in that for us getting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.050 
massive increase in that for us getting
the<00:00:55.440> right<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.160> sports<00:00:56.490> nutrition<00:00:56.910> at

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
the right the right sports nutrition at

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.640 
the right the right sports nutrition at
the<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> having<00:00:58.050> access<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.470> the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
the right time and having access to the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.170 
the right time and having access to the
right<00:00:58.710> nutrients<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.970> improve

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
right nutrients is going to improve

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.390 
right nutrients is going to improve
recovery<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.080> terms<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> field

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
recovery and in terms of on the field

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.160 
recovery and in terms of on the field
that's<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.870> physics

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that's that's what we're in the physics

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's that's what we're in the physics
world<00:01:04.320> we're<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> business<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.979> winning

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
world we're in the business of winning

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.069 
world we're in the business of winning
so<00:01:05.549> having<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.149> right<00:01:06.179> nutrients<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> right

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
so having the right nutrients and right

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.469 
so having the right nutrients and right
balance<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.590> crucial<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.969> as<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
balance is crucial when you as well and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
balance is crucial when you as well and
I<00:01:09.600> find<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> effects<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.520> absolutely

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
I find the effects you know absolutely

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
I find the effects you know absolutely
brilliant<00:01:12.329> for<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:12.899> from<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.259> recovery<00:01:13.530> point

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
brilliant for me from a recovery point

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.169 
brilliant for me from a recovery point
of<00:01:14.009> view<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.219> well<00:01:14.399> I'm<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.609> fortunately<00:01:15.000> at

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
of view as well I'm now fortunately at

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.999 
of view as well I'm now fortunately at
that<00:01:15.270> age<00:01:15.420> where<00:01:15.719> it's<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.380> about<00:01:16.590> recovery

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that age where it's more about recovery

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.670 
that age where it's more about recovery
than<00:01:17.219> anything<00:01:17.429> else

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.350 

it's<00:01:25.100> mainly<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.670> recovery<00:01:26.120> after

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
it's mainly for the recovery after

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.730 
it's mainly for the recovery after
you've<00:01:26.510> done<00:01:26.630> session<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.260> can<00:01:27.410> go<00:01:27.560> back

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
you've done session so you can go back

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.800 
you've done session so you can go back
connect<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.640> carry<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.060> I'll<00:01:29.300> increase

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
connect in and carry on I'll increase

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.810 
connect in and carry on I'll increase
what<00:01:30.200> you're<00:01:30.290> doing<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.680> gym<00:01:30.920> or<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.640> work

up the next day I'm not a saw that's
that's<00:01:39.620> key<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.130> don't<00:01:40.220> want<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.460> be

that's key really you don't want to be

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
that's key really you don't want to be
