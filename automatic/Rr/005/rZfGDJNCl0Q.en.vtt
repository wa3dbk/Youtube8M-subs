oh<00:00:00.060> the<00:00:01.050> HD<00:00:01.410> 7850<00:00:02.100> can't<00:00:02.669> run<00:00:02.879> crysis<00:00:03.360> 3<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.659> max

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
oh the HD 7850 can't run crysis 3 on max

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.470 
oh the HD 7850 can't run crysis 3 on max
settings<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.730> rises<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> equivalent<00:00:06.390> of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
settings and rises the equivalent of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.459 
settings and rises the equivalent of
that<00:00:07.010> so<00:00:08.120> therefore<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.269> actually<00:00:09.750> can't<00:00:10.080> run

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
that so therefore you actually can't run

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.289

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.650 
that's insane and of course you're going
to<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.609> physics<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.210> almost<00:01:00.359> every

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

have no doubt that the blood and gore

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.340 
have no doubt that the blood and gore
will<00:01:05.309> look<00:01:05.400> amazing<00:01:05.519> too<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> actually

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
will look amazing too this is actually

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
will look amazing too this is actually
being<00:01:07.470> downgraded<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> original<00:01:09.540> specs<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
being downgraded the original specs of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
being downgraded the original specs of
the<00:01:10.200> characters<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.590> models<00:01:10.979> liver<00:01:11.159> promised

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the characters and models liver promised

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.840 
the characters and models liver promised
also<00:01:12.030> we're<00:01:12.210> supposed<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.780> 1080p

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
also we're supposed to be in 1080p

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
also we're supposed to be in 1080p
because<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> Xbox<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.930> running<00:01:16.320> for

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
because the Xbox one is not running for

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
because the Xbox one is not running for
Titans<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.460> sli<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> machines<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:19.080> e3

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
Titans in sli like the machines at e3

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.570 
Titans in sli like the machines at e3
were<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.700> rise<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.380> have

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
were the rise is actually going to have

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.649 
were the rise is actually going to have
85,000<00:01:23.580> triangles<00:01:24.000> per<00:01:24.150> character<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
85,000 triangles per character and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.510 
85,000 triangles per character and
they're<00:01:24.750> probably<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
they're probably going to have to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
they're probably going to have to
downgrade<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> joints<00:01:27.720> downgrade

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
downgrade you know the joints downgrade

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
downgrade you know the joints downgrade
a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> blend<00:01:28.890> shapes<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a little bit of the blend shapes and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.330 
a little bit of the blend shapes and
maybe<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.470> scale<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> physics<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
maybe you know scale back the physics a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
maybe you know scale back the physics a
bit<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:33.000> saying<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> look

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
bit I'm not saying it's going to look

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
bit I'm not saying it's going to look
bad<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.829> saying<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.189> trying<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> run<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bad I'm just saying that trying to run a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
bad I'm just saying that trying to run a
game<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> equivalent<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.200> Crysis<00:01:37.619> 3

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
game that is the equivalent of Crysis 3

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.700

on<00:01:37.920> max<00:01:38.189> settings<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.840> what<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> basically<00:01:40.560> in

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
a 10 APU is a little bit ambitious

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.679 
a 10 APU is a little bit ambitious
unless<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> were<00:01:44.610> doing<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:44.909> APU<00:01:45.149> crossfire

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
unless you were doing an APU crossfire

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
unless you were doing an APU crossfire
but<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.290> they're<00:01:46.380> doing<00:01:46.710> not

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
but that's not what they're doing not

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
but that's not what they're doing not
only<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.030> APU<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> doesn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
only that it's an APU that doesn't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
only that it's an APU that doesn't
really<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.110> super<00:01:49.439> fast<00:01:49.680> memory<00:01:49.950> backing<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
really have super fast memory backing it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
really have super fast memory backing it
up<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.240> know<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> could<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> giving<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
up you know I could see giving that a

1600<00:03:38.970> 900<00:03:39.150> image<00:03:39.540> breaks<00:03:39.840> down<00:03:40.050> right<00:03:40.350> about

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
1600 900 image breaks down right about

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.410 
1600 900 image breaks down right about
there<00:03:40.800> when<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.640> zoom<00:03:41.790> all<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.000> way<00:03:42.090> out<00:03:42.180> it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
there when you zoom all the way out it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.540 
there when you zoom all the way out it
looks<00:03:42.570> ok<00:03:42.870> now<00:03:43.380> here<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.830> canvas<00:03:44.340> that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
looks ok now here we have a canvas that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.370 
looks ok now here we have a canvas that
is<00:03:44.610> 1920<00:03:45.330> x<00:03:45.450> 1080<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> if<00:03:46.800> i<00:03:46.920> grab<00:03:47.250> our<00:03:47.519> little

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
is 1920 x 1080 so if i grab our little

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.060 
is 1920 x 1080 so if i grab our little
native<00:03:49.380> rise<00:03:49.890> image<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.910> copy<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.050> over<00:03:52.200> to

native rise image and copy it over to

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.720 
native rise image and copy it over to
our<00:03:53.100> 1920<00:03:53.760> x<00:03:53.880> 1080<00:03:54.030> canvas<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.400> put<00:03:56.640> it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
our 1920 x 1080 canvas and we put it

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.240 
our 1920 x 1080 canvas and we put it
down<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.090> corner<00:03:57.480> here<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.019> we<00:03:58.980> stretch

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
down on this corner here and we stretch

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.850 
down on this corner here and we stretch
it<00:03:59.280> out<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.989> doesn't<00:04:01.380> make<00:04:01.440> as<00:04:01.590> big<00:04:01.620> a

it out it doesn't make as big a

it out it doesn't make as big a
difference<00:04:02.040> as<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.430> upscaling<00:04:02.880> from<00:04:03.120> 720p

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
difference as the upscaling from 720p

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.810 
difference as the upscaling from 720p
that<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.110> consoles<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:04.830> doing<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:05.700> as

that the consoles now are doing but as

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.030 
that the consoles now are doing but as
you<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.090> see<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.660> know<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> pixelation

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
you can see you know the pixelation

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.199 
you can see you know the pixelation
happens<00:04:08.810> quite<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> bit<00:04:09.989> earlier<00:04:10.519> granted<00:04:11.519> not

a<00:04:12.269> huge<00:04:12.810> difference<00:04:13.049> your<00:04:13.920> game<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.160> still

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
a huge difference your game is still

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.969 
a huge difference your game is still
going<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.700> look<00:04:14.880> fine<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.410> breakdown<00:04:16.890> you

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
going to look fine but the breakdown you

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.340 
going to look fine but the breakdown you
know<00:04:17.070> if<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.250> one<00:04:17.549> wheel<00:04:17.760> click<00:04:18.060> two<00:04:18.299> three<00:04:18.900> four

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
know if I one wheel click two three four

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.969 
know if I one wheel click two three four
five<00:04:19.830> six<00:04:20.340> seven<00:04:20.760> eight<00:04:21.180> nine<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:22.590> know<00:04:22.710> like

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
five six seven eight nine you know like

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.980 
five six seven eight nine you know like
seven<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.520> nine<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:24.000> how<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.240> takes<00:04:24.419> here<00:04:24.810> and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
seven to nine is how it takes here and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.320 
seven to nine is how it takes here and
here<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.400> canvas<00:04:26.640> it's

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.200 

123456789<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.770> 10<00:04:32.159> 11<00:04:32.550> 12<00:04:32.819> it's<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:33.090> that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
123456789 you know 10 11 12 it's in that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.679 
123456789 you know 10 11 12 it's in that
range<00:04:33.449> so<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.259> does<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.610> detract<00:04:36.120> sab<00:04:36.389> it<00:04:36.539> from

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
range so it does it detract sab it from

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:37.939 
range so it does it detract sab it from
the<00:04:36.780> quality<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.289> what<00:04:37.469> I'm<00:04:37.560> trying<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.889> say

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
the quality is what I'm trying to say

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.450 
the quality is what I'm trying to say
that's<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.879> impact<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.449> rises<00:04:40.020> up<00:04:40.560> scaling

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
that's the impact that rises up scaling

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.730 
that's the impact that rises up scaling
is<00:04:41.699> having<00:04:42.060> granted<00:04:42.689> upscaling<00:04:43.229> from<00:04:43.500> you

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
is having granted upscaling from you

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.439 
is having granted upscaling from you
know<00:04:43.830> 900p<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.729> going<00:04:44.879> to<00:04:44.939> have<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> lot<00:04:45.300> less

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
know 900p is going to have a lot less

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.649 
know 900p is going to have a lot less
impact<00:04:45.840> from<00:04:45.990> upscaling<00:04:46.379> from<00:04:46.590> 720p<00:04:47.219> so<00:04:48.030> it's

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
impact from upscaling from 720p so it's

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.779 
impact from upscaling from 720p so it's
going<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:48.960> look<00:04:49.020> fine<00:04:49.409> I'm<00:04:49.620> just<00:04:49.680> saying<00:04:50.490> I'm

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
going to look fine I'm just saying I'm

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.779 
going to look fine I'm just saying I'm
just<00:04:50.849> saying<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:52.319> not<00:04:53.039> going<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.400> be<00:04:53.490> native

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
just saying it's not going to be native

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.369 
just saying it's not going to be native
1080p<00:04:53.939> and<00:04:54.509> that's<00:04:54.689> the<00:04:54.810> difference<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.259> it

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
1080p and that's the difference that it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.699 
1080p and that's the difference that it
makes<00:04:55.409> have<00:04:56.219> a<00:04:56.250> nice<00:04:56.460> dang
