00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.000
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.000
 never 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.519
 we are here in the kitchen today we are going to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.769
 show them what a deep fryer is like 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.010
 when you hear something fried it 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.080
 imagine full of fat and full of fats 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.570
 especially saturated that are the bad 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 for our body because today 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.770
 I will show you the technique very 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.160
 important for all those who love 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.510
 the writings were deep reading frame 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.120
 deep frying means that the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 product must be submerged 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 completely in oil the temperature 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.929
 It must be right for frying 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 which are approximately 180 degrees and 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.969
 knows that we are going to fry in oil 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.579
 olive although you do not clarify it 7 olive 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.370
 It is excellent for frying as long as 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 you do not pass the 180 degrees because it starts 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 to lose its properties I 'm going to say 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 Arcalia do not have a thermometer not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.239
 average temperature matter after 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 the 3 minutes to 4 is already temperature 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.430
 perfect nothing else up everything 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 because then we will start to lose 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 the properties of olive oil and it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 burning 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 we must consume no oil that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.720
 nothing or make a delicious filling of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.150

 If you do not have your hands , I 'm going to 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.370

 here I have this 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.860
 clear look with the palm they begin to 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.860
 distribute your dough until you have a 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.030
 disc about 10 centimeters 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.010

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.630
 it comes off super easy from the table like this 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.690
 they do not have any problems very well 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.050
 here we have no tortillita and I 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.480
 I have the cold filling is very important 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.490
 a spoonful 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.849
 a little less so we can 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.639
 close it easily 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.520
 there it is and a little bit of that that 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.060
 like cheese 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.060
 to me 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.440
 the quesito the truth is a great 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.230
 surprise when we approach our 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.360
 delicious pie and we're going to close it 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.790

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.060
 let's close our pie let's go 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.060
 all right 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.880
 Well here I have a list and it is already 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.070
 180 degree hot oil that I insist 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.160
 do not worry about the temperature 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.090
 just have it already hot about 3 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.690
 or 4 minutes at medium heat 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:16.200
 and with that it will be good more than enough 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.290
 I'm going to put the second one and to accompany 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.960
 our delicious empanada I have 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.350
 guacamole guacamole is very easy to 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.140
 do 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.440
 ripe avocado a little bit of tomato 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.400
 chile serrano lemon salt cilantro and remains 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.250
 wonderful 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.950
 We are talking today about how 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.290
 take care of our planet in the kitchen 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.620
 We can make many mistakes like 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.590
 throw the oil in the tap in our 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.340
 dishwasher is not really due that 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.190
 do not 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.100
 they know that a liter of oil contaminates 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.990
 a thousand liters of water in the sea 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.840
 horrible for our planet is very 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.480
 bad so please when it gets cold 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.510
 the oil tries to get a bottle 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.610
 also recycled and here we are going to put 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.650
 our oil is going to cover it and that's how it goes 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.040
 help a little there are many programs 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.380
 In Mexico, there are many dramas in 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.390
 mexico that are trying to use the 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.310
 oil reuse it either the 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.440
 fuel as you see so internet 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.380
 You can research on the internet too 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.270
 You can research how to make soap though 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.400
 you do not believe it with the soap that 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.700
 we use good every day to 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.010
 you can do it in the house 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:35.090
 here I have a little soap that can 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:38.260
 make some water with caustic soda 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:41.260
 and simply the oil that you already 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
 smells 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.229
 for me in the house and good if you can or 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:52.080
 it's done and what's left over 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.580
 Justica is that everything can be recycled and 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.770
 think about the amount of things that 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.660
 can recycle can also not aggravate 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.349
 the pollution that already sports network 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:03.530
 tasty cinnamon the most open television 

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:03.530
 never
