example here I'm connected to the numark

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
example here I'm connected to the numark
idj<00:01:09.119> pro<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> shows<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> could

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
idj pro and it shows up here I could

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.399 
idj pro and it shows up here I could
send<00:01:12.479> channels<00:01:13.380> 1<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> 2<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> USB<00:01:15.409> now

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
send channels 1 and 2 to the USB now

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.460 
send channels 1 and 2 to the USB now
that<00:01:16.590> means<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.700> my<00:01:18.150> master<00:01:18.600> signal<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.439> be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that means that my master signal will be

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
that means that my master signal will be
output<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> numark<00:01:20.729> idj<00:01:20.909> pro<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:22.140> would

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
output on the numark idj pro and i would

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380 
output on the numark idj pro and i would
need<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> use<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> headphone<00:01:23.580> jack<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.180> my

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
need to use the headphone jack of my

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.249 
need to use the headphone jack of my
ipad<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.290> queuing<00:01:25.970> now<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.630> products<00:01:28.080> such

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ipad for queuing now for products such

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.420 
ipad for queuing now for products such
as<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.740> vestax<00:01:29.159> vci<00:01:29.630> 400<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:31.320> has<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:32.250> than

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
as the vestax vci 400 that has more than

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.740 
as the vestax vci 400 that has more than
two<00:01:32.640> channels<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.390> has<00:01:33.479> four

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
two channels I think it has four

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.630 
two channels I think it has four
channels<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.710> you'd<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.070> extra<00:01:35.430> gray

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
channels so you'd have an extra gray

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.170 
channels so you'd have an extra gray
button<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:39.560> use<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.189> send

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
button here and you can use that to send

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
button here and you can use that to send
your<00:01:42.390> master<00:01:42.720> signal<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.590> Q<00:01:43.890> signal

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
your master signal and your Q signal

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.870 
your master signal and your Q signal
based<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.700> stereo<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.399> else<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.820> have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
based in stereo so what else do we have

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.560

transport<00:02:25.050> control<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:25.980> could<00:02:26.190> use<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.670> nice

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
transport control you could use a nice

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.650 
transport control you could use a nice
little<00:02:27.450> pad<00:02:27.750> controller<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> acai<00:02:29.660> LPD

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
little pad controller like the acai LPD

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.830 
little pad controller like the acai LPD
8<00:02:31.610> controller<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.819> your<00:02:32.940> loops<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.480> cue

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
8 controller for your loops or cue

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.869 
8 controller for your loops or cue
points<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.069> could<00:02:35.220> use<00:02:35.400> something<00:02:35.640> else

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
points and you could use something else

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.640 
points and you could use something else
as<00:02:36.120> well<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.269> really<00:02:39.750> flexible<00:02:40.200> way

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
as well so that is a really flexible way

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
as well so that is a really flexible way
of<00:02:40.860> connecting<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:42.019> multitude<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.170> midi

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
of connecting a multitude of midi

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.420 
of connecting a multitude of midi
devices<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.730> iOS<00:02:45.150> device<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> let's<00:02:47.250> take<00:02:47.370> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
devices to iOS device so let's take a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.500 
devices to iOS device so let's take a
look<00:02:47.870> we<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.049> edit<00:02:49.470> midi<00:02:49.739> maps<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.090> see

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
look we go to edit midi maps you can see

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.500 
look we go to edit midi maps you can see
I've<00:02:52.079> started<00:02:52.410> creating<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.099> few<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> idj

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I've started creating a few but the idj

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.319 
I've started creating a few but the idj
to<00:02:54.569> go<00:02:54.870> one<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.349> pretty<00:02:55.560> good<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:57.180> ID

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
to go one is pretty good because the ID

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.800 
to go one is pretty good because the ID
day<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.630> go<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.200> budget<00:02:58.739> controller<00:02:59.810> but

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
day to go is a budget controller but

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.369 
day to go is a budget controller but
through<00:03:01.440> use<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:02.010> I've<00:03:02.310> been<00:03:02.819> able<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
through use of this I've been able to

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.020 
through use of this I've been able to
implement<00:03:04.379> things<00:03:04.739> like<00:03:05.010> low-pass<00:03:05.549> high-pass

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
implement things like low-pass high-pass

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.500 
implement things like low-pass high-pass
filter<00:03:06.810> some<00:03:07.799> rudimentary<00:03:08.160> affect<00:03:09.000> mappings

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
filter some rudimentary affect mappings

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.470 
filter some rudimentary affect mappings
as<00:03:09.690> well<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.950> been<00:03:11.190> pretty<00:03:11.430> good<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
as well so it's been pretty good and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.050 
as well so it's been pretty good and
bringing<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.319> bringing<00:03:13.860> cheaper<00:03:14.549> smaller

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
bringing in bringing cheaper smaller

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.340 
bringing in bringing cheaper smaller
controllers<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.870> life<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.109> let's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
controllers to life so for this let's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.250 
controllers to life so for this let's
have<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> look<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.920> idj<00:03:20.310> pro<00:03:20.609> mappings<00:03:21.510> so

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
have a look at the idj pro mappings so

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.580 
have a look at the idj pro mappings so
this<00:03:22.410> first<00:03:22.709> page<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:24.090> basically<00:03:24.750> allowing

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this first page is basically allowing

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.930 
this first page is basically allowing
you<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:26.010> set<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.760> sequence<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.540> MIDI<00:03:27.780> actions

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
you to set up a sequence of MIDI actions

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.610 
you to set up a sequence of MIDI actions
when<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.060> first<00:03:30.329> connect<00:03:30.720> your<00:03:30.989> controller

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
when you first connect your controller

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.949 
when you first connect your controller
to<00:03:31.920> your<00:03:32.069> iOS<00:03:32.670> device<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.389> could<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.810> it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
to your iOS device so you could get it

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
to your iOS device so you could get it
to<00:03:34.079> light<00:03:34.290> up<00:03:34.530> some<00:03:35.090> buttons<00:03:36.090> or<00:03:37.099> do<00:03:38.099> something

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
to light up some buttons or do something

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.159 
to light up some buttons or do something
as<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.230> um<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:41.220> connect<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.750> as<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.079> can

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
as you um you connect it so as you can

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.309 
as you um you connect it so as you can
see<00:03:43.349> at<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.470> bottom<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.889> screen<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.810> MIDI

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
see at the bottom of the screen the MIDI

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.240 
see at the bottom of the screen the MIDI
monitor<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.010> sending<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.090> sorts<00:03:48.450> of

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
monitor is sending all sorts of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.559 
monitor is sending all sorts of
committee<00:03:50.250> change<00:03:50.639> things<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.329> press

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
committee change things as I press

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.250 
committee change things as I press
buttons<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:53.970> helps<00:03:54.329> helps<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.109> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
buttons and that helps helps you to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.559 
buttons and that helps helps you to
identify<00:03:55.290> exactly<00:03:56.160> what<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.940> controller<00:03:57.359> is

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
identify exactly what the controller is

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.490 
identify exactly what the controller is
doing<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.049> then<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:59.130> will<00:03:59.340> allow<00:03:59.910> you<00:03:59.970> to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
doing and then that will allow you to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.599 
doing and then that will allow you to
map<00:04:02.000> those<00:04:03.000> actions<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:04.349> give<00:04:04.980> them<00:04:05.130> features

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
map those actions to give them features

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.140 
map those actions to give them features
of<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.000> DJ<00:04:06.329> player<00:04:06.660> application<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:09.000> let's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
of the DJ player application so let's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.309 
of the DJ player application so let's
take<00:04:09.329> an<00:04:09.450> example<00:04:09.510> let's<00:04:10.019> take<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
take an example let's take the

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.000 
take an example let's take the
play/pause<00:04:10.560> button<00:04:10.799> okay<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.359> press<00:04:12.690> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
play/pause button okay if I press that

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.670 
play/pause button okay if I press that
it<00:04:14.010> says<00:04:14.310> right<00:04:14.519> I'm<00:04:14.849> going<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.090> learn<00:04:15.680> what

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
it says right I'm going to learn what

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680 
it says right I'm going to learn what
you're<00:04:16.950> going<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.789> controller<00:04:18.180> so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
you're going to do on the controller so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.330 
you're going to do on the controller so
basically<00:04:19.049> I've<00:04:19.139> press<00:04:19.349> that<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.739> now

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
basically I've press that is now

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.550 
basically I've press that is now
listening<00:04:20.820> for<00:04:21.030> MIDI<00:04:21.180> messages<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:22.320> if<00:04:22.440> i

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
listening for MIDI messages so if i

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.219

queues<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.310> loops<00:04:54.290> so<00:04:55.290> there's<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.530> whole

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
queues and loops so there's a whole

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.830 
queues and loops so there's a whole

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
bunch of stuff and that's just for one

deck<00:04:58.110> ok<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.460> you'd<00:04:59.580> have<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.820> same<00:05:00.060> for<00:05:00.300> deck

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
deck ok so you'd have the same for deck

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.969 
deck ok so you'd have the same for deck
be<00:05:00.720> as<00:05:00.930> well<00:05:01.340> then<00:05:02.340> with<00:05:02.580> at<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> bottom<00:05:03.979> you

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
be as well then with at the bottom you

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.110 
be as well then with at the bottom you
can<00:05:05.389> set<00:05:06.389> a<00:05:06.539> whole<00:05:06.810> bunch<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.320> MIDI<00:05:07.560> actions

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
can set a whole bunch of MIDI actions

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.860 
can set a whole bunch of MIDI actions
for<00:05:09.120> your<00:05:09.380> effect<00:05:10.380> settings<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.720> also<00:05:12.720> for

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
for your effect settings and also for

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.550 
for your effect settings and also for
the<00:05:12.960> mixer<00:05:13.320> as<00:05:13.500> well<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.850> look<00:05:18.000> at<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.270> that's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
the mixer as well so look at that that's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.770 
the mixer as well so look at that that's
pretty<00:05:19.560> much<00:05:19.830> all<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:21.000> would<00:05:21.150> ever<00:05:21.270> want<00:05:21.389> to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
pretty much all you would ever want to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.050 
pretty much all you would ever want to
do<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.889> only<00:05:23.070> things<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.430> missing<00:05:23.610> are

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
do and the only things that missing are

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.510 
do and the only things that missing are
things<00:05:24.270> like<00:05:24.389> track<00:05:24.720> load<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.830> that's

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
things like track load but that's

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.409 
things like track load but that's
probably<00:05:27.330> not<00:05:27.630> sent<00:05:27.960> as<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.199> midi<00:05:28.440> message

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
probably not sent as a midi message

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.950 
probably not sent as a midi message
that's<00:05:30.419> more<00:05:30.690> app<00:05:30.930> specific<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.770> expect<00:05:32.960> but

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
that's more app specific I expect but

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.029 
that's more app specific I expect but
all<00:05:34.260> in<00:05:34.560> all<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.979> very<00:05:35.370> very<00:05:36.270> cool<00:05:36.570> way<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:37.080> map

enough power then it will work now the
other<00:06:27.750> cool<00:06:28.020> thing<00:06:28.050> here<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:29.370> can

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
other cool thing here is that you can

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.550 
other cool thing here is that you can
share<00:06:29.910> your<00:06:29.940> maps<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:31.139> djtechtools<00:06:31.919> and

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
share your maps to djtechtools and

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.560 
share your maps to djtechtools and
that's<00:06:34.560> a<00:06:34.830> another<00:06:35.490> neat<00:06:35.760> way<00:06:35.969> of<00:06:36.000> getting<00:06:36.419> bit

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
that's a another neat way of getting bit

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.360 
that's a another neat way of getting bit
collaborative<00:06:37.140> with<00:06:37.289> your<00:06:37.409> Maps<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:38.219> could

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
collaborative with your Maps you could

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.410 
collaborative with your Maps you could
upload<00:06:38.580> a<00:06:38.700> map

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
upload a map

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.570 
upload a map
with<00:06:39.960> all<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.260> MIDI<00:06:40.620> functionality<00:06:41.280> someone

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
with all the MIDI functionality someone

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.340 
with all the MIDI functionality someone
else<00:06:41.730> could<00:06:41.910> take<00:06:42.630> a<00:06:42.660> look<00:06:42.930> at<00:06:43.050> it<00:06:43.080> and

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
else could take a look at it and

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.200 
else could take a look at it and
actually<00:06:43.500> go<00:06:43.800> well<00:06:44.010> hold<00:06:44.580> on<00:06:44.730> it<00:06:44.850> will<00:06:44.940> be<00:06:45.030> so

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
actually go well hold on it will be so

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.210 
actually go well hold on it will be so
much<00:06:45.240> better<00:06:45.570> if<00:06:45.810> you<00:06:46.110> could<00:06:46.290> tweak<00:06:46.530> this<00:06:46.770> and

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
much better if you could tweak this and

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.400 
much better if you could tweak this and
make<00:06:48.180> a<00:06:48.210> change<00:06:48.600> and<00:06:48.870> it'd<00:06:48.960> be<00:06:49.050> much<00:06:49.200> more

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
make a change and it'd be much more

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.430 
make a change and it'd be much more
useful<00:06:49.910> so<00:06:50.910> there<00:06:51.090> you<00:06:51.210> have<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.360> that's<00:06:51.660> DJ

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
useful so there you have it that's DJ

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.060 
useful so there you have it that's DJ
