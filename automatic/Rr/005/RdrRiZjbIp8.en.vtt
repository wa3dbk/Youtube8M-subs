00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.170
 hello to all here today we 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.050
 found for this twelfth tutorial 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.770
 of my ps3 operations whose theme 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.630
 will be a camouflage military controller 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.970
 So we had asked but I had 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.280
 already planned so that's good 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.890
 so for that so of course you have to have a 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.500
 joystick one has is a standard or white 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.860
 it does not matter that after we go 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.170
 so work on acrylic paint 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 that's the question, but then 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.829
 are finished we will apply varnish 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.750
 so as expected as you can the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.489
 see pardon it's a new polish so 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.840
 a last triple boss worry 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.100
 I do not put you links to buy this 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.230
 varnish in description 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.730
 So here is a myth that will happen 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.520
 with a brush or just like a 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.770
 simple painting a very ground 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.540
 complicated so you apply it in one 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.090
 layer is enough so here it is a 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.850
 bright transparent basketry here and 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 then to finish pimples 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.659
 of which x fang x buttons during cross 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.820
 square round and triangle will be andouille 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.729
 and the rest is white so after 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990
 each one his tastes I think it will be 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.490
 earlier it would have been nice too 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.960
 take khaki or beige buttons 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.450
 I white three years that I 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.210
 find it nice here and well I hope 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.070
 that the customization will please you and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.649
 will help you to make your own 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.799
 joystick of course for those who do not have 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.899
 of courage we will say to do 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.960
 launch in this customization the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.200

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.280
