00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
 the trachycarpus fortunei that one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.840
 also calls pale nor to chamber because 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.280
 fibers that covers his trunk or 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.110
 palm trees of china simply because 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 that he was born there is one of the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.629
 best known baskets and most 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.459
 used 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.869
 and for good reason this is one of the baskets that 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.340
 are the most resistant to cold 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.650
 indeed he can bear 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.080
 temperatures down to minus 15 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 at minus 18 degrees the secret is time 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.760
 that the soil is very well drained the soil 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.250
 or the bottom of the pot another 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.420
 peculiarity of trachycarpus 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 compared to other palms that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.499
 ask all of the full sun is that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.269
 will ask him instead of half-shade 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.769
 especially in the most 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.719
 sunny as the south of France 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.059
 it will be even more beautiful if you 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.039
 planting in the shade is a landing at 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.199
 relatively fast growth 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.760
 he will be able to measure 8 to 10 meters of 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.909
 top and crown all the time at 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 measures at between 70 cm up to two 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.079
 meters wide well push 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.929
 trachycarpus needs a soil rather 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 rich deep well drained so this is a 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.229
 tree that needs especially if it is in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 skin to be much watered 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.880
 I chose to plant this specimen 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.619
 pot it's going to allow me to put it to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.090
 winter shelter even though I had the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.310
 planted in the ground wondering about the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 loire he could have resisted but there I 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.790
 want to put several potted and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.649
 to make a terrace rather 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.649
 Mediterranean was in front of the house 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.789
 a good layer of clay balls from 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.789
 less than 10 cm 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.010
 i may need roland 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.850
 there to lift it because all alone 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.850
 he is already a little heavy 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:54.450
 I put the rest of the land around and we 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 complete with potting soil trachycarpus 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 requires very little maintenance 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.940
 it will be enough to cut the palms once 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.770
 that they are faded and then 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.500
 regularly you will bring the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.330
 special nutrients pamiers a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.770
 Another important point is that these 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.899
 failures are quite sensitive to large 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.420
 winds that quickly rip them apart 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.590
 give them a pretty city ​​look so 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.690
 it is not bad the power to plant it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 in a situation rather harboring 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.130
 high winds and one recognizes in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 especially trachycarpus thanks to its 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.640
 beautiful palmate leaves already with the petioles 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.410
 flattened end with very small teeth 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.810
 but who does not sting so no danger 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 we can not hurt ourselves and it's the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.680
 old petioles once they have been 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.230
 cut that gives that hemp that goes 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.980
 completely cover the trunk 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.780
 call a this guy you water him 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.370
 abundantly you should not be surprised 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.130
 start having a little bit of trouble 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.570
 restart and then it will be gone for 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.570
 a rather fast growth
