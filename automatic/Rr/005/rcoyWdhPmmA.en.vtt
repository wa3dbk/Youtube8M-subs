blocks<00:02:14.250> quite<00:02:15.030> separately<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.930> keep<00:02:16.590> them

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
blocks quite separately and keep them

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.930 
blocks quite separately and keep them
separated<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> winery<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> it's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
separated in the in the winery so it's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120 
separated in the in the winery so it's
it's<00:02:21.270> all<00:02:21.510> about<00:02:21.930> quality<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:22.800> about

and you know the latest technology
allows<00:02:32.430> us<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.960> it's<00:02:34.500> quite<00:02:34.740> a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
allows us to do that if it's quite a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 
allows us to do that if it's quite a
unique<00:02:35.070> vineyard<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:36.570> from

behind there's it's actually planted
around<00:02:39.709> three<00:02:40.709> hills<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:42.240> those<00:02:42.390> hills<00:02:42.750> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
around three hills and those hills you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.430 
around three hills and those hills you
know<00:02:43.290> from<00:02:43.830> WA<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.490> actually<00:02:44.760> quite<00:02:44.880> hired

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
know from WA are actually quite hired

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.310 
know from WA are actually quite hired
360<00:02:46.440> odd<00:02:46.560> metres<00:02:46.920> above<00:02:47.390> above<00:02:48.390> sea<00:02:48.810> level<00:02:49.200> and

360 odd metres above above sea level and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.860 
360 odd metres above above sea level and
you<00:02:49.770> know<00:02:49.890> bummer<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.310> only<00:02:50.459> 20<00:02:50.870> kilometers

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you know bummer is only 20 kilometers

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.930 
you know bummer is only 20 kilometers
away<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.190> nice<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:54.510> maritime

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
away so we do get this nice the maritime

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.490 
away so we do get this nice the maritime
influence<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.090> see<00:02:57.330> breezes<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
influence we see breezes in the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.810 
influence we see breezes in the
afternoons<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.520> what<00:02:59.670> we're

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
afternoons and I think what we're

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.310 
afternoons and I think what we're
getting<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.620> great<00:03:01.890> expression<00:03:02.400> of

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
getting is is just a great expression of

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.340 
getting is is just a great expression of
natural<00:03:04.320> fruit<00:03:04.680> flavors<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.050> what<00:03:07.230> we

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
natural fruit flavors and and what we

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.220 
natural fruit flavors and and what we
can<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.459> our<00:03:09.150> blending<00:03:09.720> options

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
can do then is is our blending options

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.560 
can do then is is our blending options
due<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.100> different<00:03:11.550> aspects<00:03:12.060> within<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
due to the different aspects within the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
due to the different aspects within the
vineyard<00:03:12.959> give<00:03:13.620> us<00:03:13.770> some<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.459> good

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
vineyard give us some really good

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.170 
vineyard give us some really good
options<00:03:15.060> from<00:03:15.330> blending<00:03:16.400> well<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.790> soil

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
options from blending well that the soil

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.990 
options from blending well that the soil
at<00:03:18.420> Willow<00:03:18.660> bridge<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.890> quite<00:03:20.220> consistent

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
at Willow bridge is is quite consistent

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.810 
at Willow bridge is is quite consistent
um<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.140> can<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.500> see<00:03:23.070> down<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.519> we

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
um you know we can see see down here we

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.610 
um you know we can see see down here we
there's<00:03:24.330> nice<00:03:24.720> gravely<00:03:25.500> limes<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:27.420> deep<00:03:28.140> sort

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
there's nice gravely limes the deep sort

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.449 
there's nice gravely limes the deep sort
of<00:03:28.709> soil<00:03:29.900> hence<00:03:30.900> we've<00:03:31.470> actually<00:03:31.650> planted<00:03:32.310> our

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
of soil hence we've actually planted our

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.170 
of soil hence we've actually planted our
vines<00:03:32.730> four<00:03:33.600> meters<00:03:33.989> apart<00:03:34.320> just<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.340> make

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
vines four meters apart just to make

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.970 
vines four meters apart just to make
sure<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.959> actually<00:03:37.110> make<00:03:37.530> them<00:03:37.739> work

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
sure that we do actually make them work

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.160 
sure that we do actually make them work
a<00:03:38.190> little<00:03:38.370> bit<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> strong

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
a little bit because it is a strong

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.520 
a little bit because it is a strong
vigorous<00:03:40.500> site<00:03:41.299> but<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.450> saying<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.080> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
vigorous site but in saying that the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.100 
vigorous site but in saying that the
work<00:03:44.070> we've<00:03:44.310> done<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> vineyard<00:03:45.120> we're

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
work we've done in the vineyard we're

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.280 
work we've done in the vineyard we're
now<00:03:46.730> got<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.760> vineyard<00:03:48.239> practices<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.019> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
now got the vineyard practices and the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
now got the vineyard practices and the
actual<00:03:49.470> canopies<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:51.600> cope<00:03:51.870> with<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.970> so

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
actual canopies to to cope with that so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.000 
actual canopies to to cope with that so
that's<00:03:54.209> yeah<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:55.140> think<00:03:55.410> that's<00:03:55.739> quite<00:03:55.980> unique

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that's yeah I think that's quite unique

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.380 
that's yeah I think that's quite unique
to<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.090> region<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.830> how

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
to this to this region is just how

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
to this to this region is just how
consistent<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.420> soil<00:04:00.750> type<00:04:01.080> far<00:04:01.380> hear<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
consistent the soil type far hear it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.479 
consistent the soil type far hear it
geograph<00:04:03.330> been<00:04:03.570> such<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> big<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.160> diverse

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
geograph been such a big and diverse

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.930 
geograph been such a big and diverse
region<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.540> think<00:04:06.840> what<00:04:07.380> we've<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:07.769> got<00:04:08.160> in

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
region but I think what we've all got in

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.030 
region but I think what we've all got in
common<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.630> what<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.959> all<00:04:10.140> actually<00:04:10.380> try<00:04:10.829> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
common and what we all actually try and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.660 
common and what we all actually try and
do<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.519> produce<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:13.230> best<00:04:13.260> quality<00:04:13.670> fruit

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
do is produce the best quality fruit

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.349 
do is produce the best quality fruit
from<00:04:15.660> our<00:04:16.260> own<00:04:16.560> vineyards<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.269> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
from our own vineyards a lot of the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.449 
from our own vineyards a lot of the
