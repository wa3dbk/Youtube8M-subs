that you can strike a spark now this big

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.630 
that you can strike a spark now this big
bag<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:24.820> what<00:00:25.360> this<00:00:26.020> bag<00:00:26.290> is<00:00:26.500> linen<00:00:26.919> toe<00:00:27.250> or<00:00:27.579> toe

thing in kind of a hemp rope right you

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.250 
thing in kind of a hemp rope right you
can<00:00:34.120> pull<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.360> hemp<00:00:34.510> rope<00:00:34.660> apart<00:00:34.960> into<00:00:35.079> its

can pull the hemp rope apart into its

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.360 
can pull the hemp rope apart into its
fibers<00:00:35.590> now<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.910> this<00:00:37.059> case<00:00:37.329> typically<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.530> in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
fibers now in this case typically I in

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.020 
fibers now in this case typically I in
the<00:00:39.489> 1700s<00:00:40.239> 1800s<00:00:40.690> they<00:00:41.320> would<00:00:41.500> have<00:00:41.590> carried

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the 1700s 1800s they would have carried

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.130 
the 1700s 1800s they would have carried
this<00:00:43.030> this<00:00:43.390> tin<00:00:43.570> would<00:00:43.690> have<00:00:43.780> had<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.899> small

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
this this tin would have had a small

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.369 
this this tin would have had a small
hole<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.850> inside<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.910> this<00:00:46.059> tin<00:00:46.449> would

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
hole in it and inside of this tin would

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.360 
hole in it and inside of this tin would
be<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.760> cloth<00:00:49.480> or<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:49.809> bag<00:00:50.109> with<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.190> steel<00:00:52.000> striker

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
be a cloth or a bag with a steel striker

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.369 
be a cloth or a bag with a steel striker
and<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:55.300> Flintstone<00:00:56.370> okay<00:00:58.109> inside<00:00:59.109> of<00:00:59.260> that

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
and a Flintstone okay inside of that

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.119 
and a Flintstone okay inside of that
would<00:00:59.589> be<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.739> smaller<00:01:00.039> container<00:01:02.010> inside<00:01:03.010> of

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
would be a smaller container inside of

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.170 
would be a smaller container inside of
this<00:01:03.219> container<00:01:03.609> is<00:01:04.650> char<00:01:05.650> cloth<00:01:06.000> okay

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
this container is char cloth okay

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.710 
this container is char cloth okay
so<00:01:07.770> essentially<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:09.010> you<00:01:09.159> have<00:01:09.940> how<00:01:10.360> this<00:01:10.570> is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
so essentially what you have how this is

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.749 
so essentially what you have how this is
done<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.800> take<00:01:12.159> a<00:01:12.210> square<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:17.610> cotton<00:01:18.610> or

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
done is you take a square of cotton or

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.889 
done is you take a square of cotton or
linen<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:20.880> you'll<00:01:21.880> put<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.540> larger

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
linen and you'll put it in this larger

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.959 
linen and you'll put it in this larger
container<00:01:23.280> several<00:01:24.280> squares<00:01:24.579> all<00:01:24.790> together

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
container several squares all together

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.719 
container several squares all together
and<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.990> put<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.259> lid<00:01:26.409> on<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.729> you've

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
and you put the lid on and you've

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.450 
and you put the lid on and you've
punched<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.210> small<00:01:28.390> hole<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.170> top<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.040> you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
punched a small hole in the top and you

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.230 
punched a small hole in the top and you
would<00:01:30.579> put<00:01:30.759> this<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.149> fire<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.210> smoke

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
would put this in the fire and the smoke

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.200 
would put this in the fire and the smoke
you<00:01:34.689> know<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.649> linen<00:01:36.250> fibers<00:01:36.670> would<00:01:37.000> turn

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
you know the the linen fibers would turn

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.999 
you know the the linen fibers would turn
to<00:01:37.360> charcoal<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.380> smoke<00:01:38.619> would<00:01:38.770> come<00:01:38.979> out

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
to charcoal and the smoke would come out

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.830 
to charcoal and the smoke would come out
the<00:01:39.250> small<00:01:39.579> hole<00:01:39.759> oh<00:01:40.000> that's<00:01:40.270> very<00:01:40.509> good
