to take a look at that I want to talk

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.900 
to take a look at that I want to talk
about<00:00:08.410> speaker<00:00:09.100> placement<00:00:09.340> right<00:00:09.700> now

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
about speaker placement right now

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.340 
about speaker placement right now
because<00:00:10.120> a<00:00:10.240> lot<00:00:10.330> of<00:00:10.570> people<00:00:10.870> make<00:00:11.050> a<00:00:11.080> lot<00:00:11.320> of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
because a lot of people make a lot of

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.970 
because a lot of people make a lot of
mistakes<00:00:11.560> when<00:00:12.040> placing<00:00:12.370> their<00:00:12.670> speakers

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
mistakes when placing their speakers

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.560 
mistakes when placing their speakers
typically<00:00:14.980> what<00:00:15.130> people<00:00:15.160> do<00:00:15.580> is<00:00:16.209> they<00:00:16.240> take<00:00:16.510> a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
typically what people do is they take a

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.870 
typically what people do is they take a
subwoofer<00:00:16.990> they<00:00:17.950> put<00:00:18.160> it<00:00:18.220> on<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.400> floor<00:00:18.640> and

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
subwoofer they put it on the floor and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.970 
subwoofer they put it on the floor and
then<00:00:19.750> they<00:00:19.869> put<00:00:20.020> a<00:00:20.050> pull<00:00:20.289> off<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.530> subwoofer

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
then they put a pull off the subwoofer

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.029 
then they put a pull off the subwoofer
and<00:00:21.910> then<00:00:22.240> they<00:00:22.330> put<00:00:22.510> them<00:00:22.630> in<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:23.110> then<00:00:23.949> they

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
and then they put them in and then they

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.740 
and then they put them in and then they
do<00:00:24.100> that<00:00:24.340> on<00:00:24.490> each<00:00:24.610> side<00:00:24.850> of<00:00:24.970> stage<00:00:25.210> well

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
do that on each side of stage well

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.810 
do that on each side of stage well
actually<00:00:26.140> you're<00:00:26.560> better<00:00:26.770> off<00:00:27.010> to<00:00:27.310> have<00:00:27.340> two

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
actually you're better off to have two

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.120 
actually you're better off to have two
separate<00:00:28.270> speaker<00:00:28.630> stands<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:29.260> put<00:00:29.949> your

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
separate speaker stands and put your

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.099 
separate speaker stands and put your
subs<00:00:30.400> together<00:00:30.850> because<00:00:31.270> what<00:00:31.449> you<00:00:31.600> get<00:00:31.869> when

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
subs together because what you get when

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.549 
subs together because what you get when
you<00:00:32.229> get<00:00:32.379> your<00:00:32.589> subwoofers<00:00:33.239> far<00:00:34.239> apart<00:00:34.749> is<00:00:35.409> the

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
you get your subwoofers far apart is the

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.559 
you get your subwoofers far apart is the
areas<00:00:35.949> in<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> middle<00:00:36.489> as<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.969> sound<00:00:37.390> waves

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:37.569 
areas in the middle as the sound waves

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.479 
areas in the middle as the sound waves
are<00:00:37.690> traveling<00:00:38.139> out<00:00:38.319> ended<00:00:38.679> up<00:00:38.829> end<00:00:39.339> up

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
are traveling out ended up end up

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.000 
are traveling out ended up end up
getting<00:00:39.789> cancelled<00:00:40.329> bass<00:00:40.659> out<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.109> them<00:00:41.289> so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
getting cancelled bass out of them so

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.259 
getting cancelled bass out of them so
what<00:00:42.159> you<00:00:42.280> need<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.579> do<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.850> you<00:00:42.940> need<00:00:43.089> to<00:00:43.120> get

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
what you need to do is you need to get

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.270 
what you need to do is you need to get
your<00:00:43.420> speakers<00:00:43.870> together<00:00:44.170> your<00:00:44.679> subwoofers

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
your speakers together your subwoofers

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.239 
your speakers together your subwoofers
together<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.809> bass<00:00:47.049> is<00:00:47.350> flowing<00:00:47.769> out<00:00:47.949> and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
together so the bass is flowing out and

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.099 
together so the bass is flowing out and
you<00:00:48.789> also<00:00:48.819> need<00:00:49.269> to<00:00:49.359> make<00:00:49.539> sure<00:00:49.569> that<00:00:49.899> your

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
you also need to make sure that your

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.439 
you also need to make sure that your
subwoofers<00:00:50.769> are<00:00:50.979> the<00:00:51.609> relatively<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.299> same

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
subwoofers are the relatively the same

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.829 
subwoofers are the relatively the same
distance<00:00:53.229> away<00:00:53.499> from<00:00:54.249> your<00:00:54.850> target<00:00:55.209> audience

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
distance away from your target audience

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.109 
distance away from your target audience
as<00:00:56.079> your<00:00:56.499> main<00:00:56.769> speakers<00:00:57.339> because<00:00:57.729> once<00:00:57.940> again

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
as your main speakers because once again

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.270 
as your main speakers because once again
you<00:00:58.929> start<00:00:59.199> talking<00:00:59.649> about<00:00:59.709> phase

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
you start talking about phase

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.549 
you start talking about phase
discrepancies<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.389> the<00:01:01.780> human<00:01:02.079> ear<00:01:02.229> does<00:01:02.440> an

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
discrepancies and the human ear does an

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.450 
discrepancies and the human ear does an
amazing<00:01:02.859> thing<00:01:03.210> trying<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.449> muddle<00:01:04.960> through

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
amazing thing trying to muddle through

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.160 
amazing thing trying to muddle through
why<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.880> can't<00:01:07.150> hear<00:01:07.450> things<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.050> will

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
why it can't hear things and it will

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.620 
why it can't hear things and it will
actually<00:01:08.380> sit<00:01:08.830> there<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.220> start<00:01:10.210> blocking

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
actually sit there and start blocking

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.630 
actually sit there and start blocking
out<00:01:10.930> sound<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.710> people<00:01:12.070> wonder<00:01:12.310> why<00:01:12.460> their

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
out sound and people wonder why their

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.820 
out sound and people wonder why their
base<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.150> always<00:01:13.330> muddy<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.170> they<00:01:14.410> can't<00:01:14.680> get

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
base is always muddy and they can't get

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.830 
base is always muddy and they can't get
the<00:01:14.950> right<00:01:15.100> sound<00:01:15.310> from<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> room<00:01:15.940> but<00:01:16.630> part

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
the right sound from the room but part

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.790 
the right sound from the room but part
of<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> problem<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.320> you've<00:01:17.440> got<00:01:17.590> multiple

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
of the problem is you've got multiple

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.880 
of the problem is you've got multiple
points<00:01:18.520> creating<00:01:19.180> bass<00:01:19.450> signals<00:01:19.930> basic<00:01:20.740> those

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
points creating bass signals basic those

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.400 
points creating bass signals basic those
are<00:01:21.040> long<00:01:21.370> waveforms<00:01:22.180> they<00:01:22.300> travel<00:01:22.720> 10<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:23.020> 15

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
are long waveforms they travel 10 to 15

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.010 
are long waveforms they travel 10 to 15
feet<00:01:23.440> before<00:01:23.920> forming<00:01:24.610> if<00:01:24.730> you<00:01:25.270> can<00:01:25.510> get<00:01:25.780> your

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
feet before forming if you can get your

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.830 
feet before forming if you can get your
subwoofers<00:01:26.860> further<00:01:27.790> from<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.240> stage<00:01:28.540> get

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
subwoofers further from the stage get

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.810 
subwoofers further from the stage get
your<00:01:29.020> speakers<00:01:29.410> back<00:01:29.800> from<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.220> stage<00:01:30.520> a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
your speakers back from the stage a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.300 
your speakers back from the stage a
little<00:01:31.540> bit<00:01:31.810> where<00:01:32.380> people<00:01:32.800> are<00:01:32.890> going<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.070> be

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
little bit where people are going to be

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.490 
little bit where people are going to be
you're<00:01:34.060> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.390> better<00:01:34.720> off<00:01:35.110> at

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
you're going to do better off at

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920 
you're going to do better off at
actually<00:01:36.130> hearing<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.790> bass<00:01:37.000> be<00:01:37.630> able<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.810> run

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
actually hearing the bass be able to run

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.410 
actually hearing the bass be able to run
a<00:01:37.960> lower<00:01:38.320> volume<00:01:38.740> getting<00:01:39.730> your<00:01:39.910> speakers

a lower volume getting your speakers

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.010 
a lower volume getting your speakers
together<00:01:40.900> will<00:01:41.410> double<00:01:42.130> your<00:01:42.340> volume<00:01:43.300> by<00:01:43.659> 6

the volume 10 decibels is double the
perceived<00:01:50.290> volume<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.070> will<00:01:51.220> actually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
perceived volume so it will actually

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.750 
perceived volume so it will actually
double<00:01:52.390> your<00:01:52.840> volume<00:01:53.290> by<00:01:53.560> six<00:01:53.980> decibels<00:01:54.370> with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
double your volume by six decibels with

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.270

the<00:01:54.880> same<00:01:55.210> amount<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.600> power<00:01:55.780> by<00:01:56.470> getting<00:01:56.979> your

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the same amount of power by getting your

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.420 
the same amount of power by getting your

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
subwoofers together so anyway that is my

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.350 
subwoofers together so anyway that is my
big<00:02:00.670> tip<00:02:00.850> for<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.120> day<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.510> hope<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.170> pull
