00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.450
 I do not know what is happening 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.150
 because if I have width 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.560
 let's see the vale vale 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.120

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.120
 missiles you know no no 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:59.460

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:03.190
 come and racing this is the race me 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.280
 leave and let me an anti-tank mine is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.409
 it's not worth it with the pumps, there's 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.540
 when it bursts 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.080
 if I'm still alive 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.480
 it seems that it does not pass 2.6 kilometers 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480
 over 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.110
 let's see I have to always go 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.770
 slowly because if I do not get caught is that my 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770
 car runs so much 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:57.280
 to me because I make the post this bad and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 is exploited 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 they are misfortunes 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.010
 but this seriously 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.560
 25 seconds is what it takes to 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.280
 load after a mine inside a 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.280
 misplaced parking 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.069

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 in the mine parking 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:12.230
