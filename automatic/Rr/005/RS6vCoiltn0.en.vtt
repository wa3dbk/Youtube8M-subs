00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.860 
to let the chickens pretend to be
free-range<00:01:00.280> why<00:01:00.700> don't<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.120> just<00:01:01.360> let<00:01:01.630> them

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
free-range why don't you just let them

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.090 
free-range why don't you just let them
be<00:01:01.900> free-range

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
be free-range

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.189 
be free-range
well<00:01:03.280> there<00:01:03.580> are<00:01:03.760> supposedly<00:01:04.449> too<00:01:04.930> many

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
well there are supposedly too many

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.900 
well there are supposedly too many
chickens<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> United<00:01:06.310> States<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.760> let

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
chickens in the United States to let

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.820 
chickens in the United States to let
them<00:01:07.060> all<00:01:07.270> be<00:01:07.300> free-range<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.680> where

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
them all be free-range and this is where

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.890 
them all be free-range and this is where
Stuart<00:01:09.220> got<00:01:09.400> his<00:01:09.580> idea<00:01:09.880> from<00:01:10.060> he<00:01:10.540> wanted<00:01:10.810> to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
Stuart got his idea from he wanted to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.540 
Stuart got his idea from he wanted to
create<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.380> technology<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.130> raise<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
create the technology to raise the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.910 
create the technology to raise the
question<00:01:12.970> how<00:01:13.240> do<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.510> know<00:01:13.660> what<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.230> best<00:01:14.560> or

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
question how do we know what is best or

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.010 
question how do we know what is best or
humane<00:01:15.340> treatment<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.090> also<00:01:16.420> how<00:01:16.660> we<00:01:16.690> treat

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
humane treatment and also how we treat

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.690 
humane treatment and also how we treat
ourselves<00:01:17.140> we<00:01:17.800> live<00:01:18.010> in<00:01:18.100> these<00:01:18.220> little<00:01:18.520> boxes

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
ourselves we live in these little boxes

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.370 
ourselves we live in these little boxes
just<00:01:19.390> like<00:01:19.540> chickens

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
just like chickens

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.110 
just like chickens
even<00:01:20.800> though<00:01:20.950> would<00:01:21.310> be<00:01:21.340> far<00:01:21.700> too<00:01:21.730> expensive

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
even though would be far too expensive

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120 
even though would be far too expensive
to<00:01:22.540> implement<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.080> full<00:01:23.260> system<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:23.830> order

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
to implement the full system in order

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.250 
to implement the full system in order
for<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.400> question<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:24.850> seem<00:01:25.150> real<00:01:25.450> he<00:01:25.840> needed

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
for the question to seem real he needed

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.660 
for the question to seem real he needed
to<00:01:26.380> prove<00:01:26.620> that<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.950> technology<00:01:27.550> was

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
to prove that the technology was

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.060 
to prove that the technology was
possible<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.450> real<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.930> question<00:01:29.320> seems<00:01:29.620> sir

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
possible and real the question seems sir

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.130 
possible and real the question seems sir
so<00:01:30.490> tell<00:01:30.700> me<00:01:30.730> you<00:01:30.909> guys<00:01:31.030> how<00:01:31.480> do<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:31.780> know<00:01:31.930> what

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
so tell me you guys how do we know what

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.440 
so tell me you guys how do we know what
is<00:01:32.260> best<00:01:32.530> or<00:01:32.800> humane<00:01:33.220> treatment<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.240> think

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
is best or humane treatment do you think

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.000 
is best or humane treatment do you think
that<00:01:34.600> chickens<00:01:34.930> deserve<00:01:35.230> to<00:01:35.380> be<00:01:35.470> cooped<00:01:35.650> up<00:01:35.800> in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
that chickens deserve to be cooped up in
