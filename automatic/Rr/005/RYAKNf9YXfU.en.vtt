00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 Car manufacturers actually a hydrogen powered vehicle 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.600
 presents that have undergone serial development process 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.689
 as long as a nationwide hydrogen supply is not 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.889
 guaranteed is the bivalent designed mother that the individuals 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.019
 the 7 by simply switching the mode on conventional 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 Resort to premium gasoline 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.210
 With a customer-friendly hydrogen coupling, the vehicle is fueled after 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.609
 locking the tango plumper team line for refueling 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.609
 Approved 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 deep cold hydrogen dip in the sand 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.600
 There is always a layer on the liquid hydrogen in the tank 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 gaseous hydrogen 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.100
 after completion of the refueling process, the tan clutch is reversed again 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.520
 Order is popular 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.760
 When starting the vehicle, the engine is using gaseous hydrogen 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
 supplies the gaseous hydrogen flows at ambient temperature in the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.310
 Haag 2 engine 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.749
 In the suction system, the gaseous hydrogen is mixed with atmospheric oxygen 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.630
 In the h2 combustion engine, this mixture is burned and burned directly into 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630
 converted mechanical energy 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.200
 The engine can easily be switched between Hardt 2 and petrol mode 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.820
 the combustion of hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen produces water vapor 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 the water vapor flows through the exhaust system 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.390
 the BMW Hydrogen 7 accelerates from zero to one hundred in 9 com from 5 seconds 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.030
 reaches an electronically limited top speed of 230 these 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870
 Values ​​become both with hydrogen soon also in gasoline
