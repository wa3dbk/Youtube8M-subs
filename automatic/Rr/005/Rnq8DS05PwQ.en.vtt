00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
couple of different ways based on this

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.400 
couple of different ways based on this
it<00:03:56.040> will<00:03:56.300> decide<00:03:57.300> on<00:03:57.480> how<00:03:57.690> much<00:03:57.840> memory<00:03:58.260> to

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
it will decide on how much memory to

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.180 
it will decide on how much memory to
allocate<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.220> MySQL<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.740> either<00:04:01.890> choose

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
because we don't need to do that all

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.900 
because we don't need to do that all
right<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.290> now<00:04:25.650> we<00:04:25.710> need<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.950> go<00:04:26.190> ahead<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.610> set

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
current password should be blank so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.620 
current password should be blank so
we'll<00:04:33.690> go<00:04:33.900> ahead<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.200> skip<00:04:34.440> that
