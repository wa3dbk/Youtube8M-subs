00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 today is a fundamental day in the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.210
 Every boy's life today is the day 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.340
 of the state exams we are at the institute 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.990
 commercial technician cecilia deganutti ed 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 today is an important day also for 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.639
 a cardholder and the Udinese for simone 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 scudett friulana doc which he supported 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.010
 he, too, the first proof of the theme 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.199
 we interviewed him here 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.859
 what he told us, I think it's gone 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 quite well the first test today 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.410
 wrote what because I knew what 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.960
 I felt in the technical field 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
 scientific I hope it went well 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 why did you choose that one? 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.300
 trace there but it is a topic anyway 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.420
 interesting that speaks 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.220
 What is the new communication systems 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.010
 however in young enough 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.350
 known I had something to write is 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.660
 lived your night before the exams e 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.329
 38 here with a little anxiety a little 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.409
 shaking a quiet night at home 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.839
 obviously a little anxiety before the exam 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.690
 they all have it is normal now 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.970
 there is a bit like saying a sense of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.670
 tranquility or whatever you know tomorrow 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.820
 you told me it is perhaps the hardest test 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.300
 the second is the economy one 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.479
 second 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.710
 I think it's the hardest not just for 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.170
 me, however, to do better as possible 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.490
 in short, a bit like a bit like in football 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.789
 is also committing itself 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.190
 at school it's a personal thing of mine 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.100
 I always try to do the best in me 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.619
 everything I do and then point to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.780
 do well this too we also succeed in 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.450
 maybe give a small preview of a 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 final grade to what points precisely 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 certainly much higher than 69 everything 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.770
 what comes 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.479
 I take it positively though obviously 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 just vote that it is the highest 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.560
 You can then have time after the exams 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.689
 for a while he is already planning 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.270
 something there is a few days off 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.200
 to disconnect then ready to start again 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 for next year
