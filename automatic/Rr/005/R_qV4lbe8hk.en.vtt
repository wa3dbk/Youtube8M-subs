whole body is curved there's no fenders
there's<00:00:24.660> very<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> measure<00:00:25.500> off<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.010> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
there's very little to measure off of so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
straightedge extended that with a chalk
line<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.980> he's<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.340> himself<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.759> nice

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
line and now he's got himself a nice

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.200 
line and now he's got himself a nice
straight<00:00:33.270> line<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.719> he<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> measure<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
straight line that he can measure the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
straight line that he can measure the
caster<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.649> caster<00:00:37.649> measurement<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
caster off of caster measurement is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
caster off of caster measurement is
taken<00:00:38.600> when<00:00:39.600> turning<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> wheel<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.620> start

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
taken when turning the wheel you start

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.220 
taken when turning the wheel you start
the<00:00:41.460> base<00:00:41.640> measurement<00:00:42.059> when<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> turn<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the base measurement when you turn the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
the base measurement when you turn the
wheel<00:00:43.350> 15<00:00:43.950> degrees<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.809> we've<00:00:45.960> made<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
wheel 15 degrees out so we've made this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959 
wheel 15 degrees out so we've made this
template<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> cardboard<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
template here out of cardboard so that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
template here out of cardboard so that
we<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.180> where<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> line<00:00:49.680> up

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
we know where to you know how to line up

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
we know where to you know how to line up
the<00:00:49.920> tire<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.149> line<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> tire<00:00:51.719> 15

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the tire so we line up the tire 15

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.709 
the tire so we line up the tire 15
degrees<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.000> side<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.420> measuring

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
degrees out on the side you're measuring

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.740 
degrees out on the side you're measuring
the<00:00:54.870> caster<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.910> then<00:00:56.910> mark<00:00:57.239> will<00:00:57.390> install

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the caster with then mark will install

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
the caster with then mark will install
the<00:00:57.960> gauge<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> wheel

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 

and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.320> using<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.469> level<00:01:10.829> again<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.219> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and then using that level again at the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.169 
and then using that level again at the
front<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> side<00:01:13.759> hill<00:01:14.759> level

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
front there the side to side hill level

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.080 
front there the side to side hill level
that<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.689> then<00:01:18.689> zero<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.920> bubble<00:01:20.579> for

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that and then zero the bubble for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.630 
that and then zero the bubble for
adjusting<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> caster<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.950> here's<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:23.399> zero

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
adjusting the caster so here's the zero

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.919 
adjusting the caster so here's the zero
mark<00:01:23.850> he's<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> line<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.539> bubble<00:01:24.810> up

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
mark he's going to line the bubble up

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.440 
mark he's going to line the bubble up
with<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:27.979> then<00:01:28.979> we'll<00:01:29.189> move<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.939> cardboard

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
with and then we'll move the cardboard

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
with and then we'll move the cardboard
template<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.090> turn<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.630> wheel

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
template so that we can turn the wheel

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:46.270 
template so that we can turn the wheel
15<00:01:36.240> degrees<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.079> other<00:01:37.380> direction

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.840 

so<00:01:46.850> if<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.060> take<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.300> look<00:01:47.540> at<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.870> bubble<00:01:48.850> on

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
so if you take a look at the bubble on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.270 
so if you take a look at the bubble on
the<00:01:49.910> castor<00:01:50.540> by<00:01:51.380> measuring<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.950> mark<00:01:52.160> just

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the castor by measuring this mark just

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560 
the castor by measuring this mark just
made<00:01:52.460> himself<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.820> bunch<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.120> work<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.420> himself

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
made himself a bunch of work for himself

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.820 
made himself a bunch of work for himself
we've<00:01:54.530> got<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.430> degree<00:01:55.850> or<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.030> degree<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
we've got like a degree or a degree in a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.670 
we've got like a degree or a degree in a
quarter-<00:01:58.270> castor<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.420> remember<00:02:00.140> negative<00:02:00.320> is

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
quarter- castor and remember negative is

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.650 
quarter- castor and remember negative is
bad<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.190> like<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.370> shopping<00:02:01.640> cart<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.420> turns

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
bad it's like a shopping cart it turns

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.000 
bad it's like a shopping cart it turns
real<00:02:02.869> well<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.290> won't<00:02:03.440> go<00:02:03.560> fast<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:03.979> a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
real well but it won't go fast in a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.250 
real well but it won't go fast in a
straight<00:02:04.040> line
