00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.400
 good accompaniment does not have anything that 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.139
 watch 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.469
 hello youtube friends I'm retired and 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.120
 joins bencinero a tutorial of how 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:22.080
 make milk for your happy baby 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.080
 olivÃ¡n 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.580
 and well let's start with the bananas 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.810
 a painting of which you want to 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.860
 yellow color 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.080
 I had veron with water and a lotion or a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 cream as liquid that is to say of your 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.100
 preference that is white and extra water 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.950
 but now I'm going to tell you why not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.130
 I have it in mind, that's the only thing 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.800
 what we need are we going to start doing 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.230
 the tutorial 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.630
 good to me thank you first house do is 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.630
 take you 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.250
 your yellow paint and with the extra water 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.490
 when advancing so much you have to stay 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 almost yellowish valuation is not 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.070
 so much because I bottle yellow but 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.790
 it seems that the bottle that will occupy 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.540
 so that you keep them not not 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.000
 worry do not occupy it do not occupy it and 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.240
 Well you're going to take your bottle with water 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.830
 and you're going to remove the lid and well you're going to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.350
 put the light and that you want 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.370
 depending on the sensations I had 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.880
 verÃ³n and already streets 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.880
 i 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.050
 all right 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.509
 if I tell you very pale 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.050
 then a little more leisure no 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.280
 you want to say and there will be more scenario going to 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.280
 start shaking again 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:41.650
 free you are going to put the painting with 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 water because it's like it's coloring 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.970
 but it is much less strong 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.460
 the mind is stronger I'm going to 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 put up the yellowish one that you 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.960
 you want and good the yellow the milk of 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.960
 true 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.710
 it's yellow it deserves a little less 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.099
 it already takes away the color that you 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.260
 Y 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.370
 and the time being fine 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.360
 as the color you want 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 you will see a little more because I do not 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.090
 nothing colored 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.480
 and good if this you have to be to me 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 I keep the yellowish color there 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.030
 you can see good you can notice a little 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.390
 and it seems 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.879
 there 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.610
 ay it seems a real 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.920
 if you want to discard more yellow because 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.970
 some milk the night I had was 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.430
 very yellow 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.600
 and well you can take more to the ring 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.460
 as you want 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.940
 and well I milk because you can not take 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.320
 in the painting directly because that's how 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.900
 you're going to stain all this all this 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.390
 have a lot of paint and do not want 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.760
 be its truth and it will not last either 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.460
 so obvious this because also if I 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.530
 you leave a month with this painting also you 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.070
 is going to fill you up so you will not have 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.070
 I recommend so much but you just 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.050
