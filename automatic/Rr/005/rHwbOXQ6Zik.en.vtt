having a blast with the 18 scale
problems<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.560> was<00:00:24.680> talking<00:00:24.920> about<00:00:26.350> well<00:00:27.350> this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
problems I was talking about well this

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.139 
problems I was talking about well this
just<00:00:27.800> plain<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:28.480> got<00:00:29.480> all<00:00:29.630> boats<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:31.550> rear

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
just plain it got all boats the rear

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.270 
just plain it got all boats the rear
this<00:00:33.250> was<00:00:34.250> like<00:00:34.929> walked<00:00:35.929> up<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.530> don't

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
this was like walked up I don't

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.139 
this was like walked up I don't
understand<00:00:37.670> it<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:37.999> walked<00:00:38.359> up<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:38.809> I<00:00:40.149> guess

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
understand it it walked up and I guess

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.669 
understand it it walked up and I guess
the<00:00:41.389> ring<00:00:41.600> gear<00:00:41.780> had<00:00:41.899> broken<00:00:42.139> loose<00:00:42.289> from<00:00:42.409> the

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
the ring gear had broken loose from the

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.279 
the ring gear had broken loose from the
sand<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.389> would<00:00:44.510> just<00:00:44.539> slip<00:00:44.899> they

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
sand and it would just slip they

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.319 
sand and it would just slip they
wouldn't<00:00:45.559> pull<00:00:45.739> half<00:00:46.370> time<00:00:46.609> it<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:46.879> walk<00:00:47.089> up

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
wouldn't pull half time it just walk up

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.719 
wouldn't pull half time it just walk up
and<00:00:47.629> then<00:00:48.049> you<00:00:48.139> know<00:00:48.319> just<00:00:48.350> drag<00:00:48.769> itself<00:00:49.069> so

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
and then you know just drag itself so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.340 
and then you know just drag itself so
the<00:00:50.059> front<00:00:50.329> would<00:00:50.479> always<00:00:50.659> pull<00:00:51.109> really

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the front would always pull really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.809 
the front would always pull really
really<00:00:51.649> hard<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:52.069> then<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.370> would<00:00:52.549> just<00:00:52.579> kind

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
really hard and then we would just kind

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.250 
really hard and then we would just kind
of<00:00:52.909> tag<00:00:53.089> along<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:56.809> thought<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.079> would<00:00:57.170> be

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
of tag along and I thought it would be

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.689 
of tag along and I thought it would be
we<00:00:57.409> probably<00:00:57.709> do<00:00:57.949> it<00:00:58.010> all<00:00:58.100> part<00:00:58.429> but<00:00:58.549> it's

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
we probably do it all part but it's

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.910 
we probably do it all part but it's
actually<00:00:58.999> really<00:00:59.149> easy<00:00:59.319> and<00:01:00.319> I<00:01:00.440> got<00:01:00.619> the<00:01:00.739> rear

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
actually really easy and I got the rear

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.430 
actually really easy and I got the rear
disc<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.819> I<00:01:02.449> mean<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.899> front<00:01:03.079> gets<00:01:03.350> in

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
disc and the I mean the front gets in

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.550 
disc and the I mean the front gets in
the<00:01:03.559> rear<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.390> I'm<00:01:05.390> sure<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.720> naysayers<00:01:06.350> up

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the rear and I'm sure the naysayers up

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.350 
the rear and I'm sure the naysayers up
and<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:06.890> off<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.280> ever<00:01:07.430> go<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:07.760> full<00:01:08.030> right

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
and so off you ever go like full right

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.570 
and so off you ever go like full right
well<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.870> give<00:01:09.200> toasts<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:09.950> I<00:01:10.010> actually<00:01:10.160> try<00:01:10.550> to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
well I give toasts and I actually try to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.000 
well I give toasts and I actually try to
I<00:01:11.000> might<00:01:11.420> go<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:11.930> see<00:01:12.110> what's<00:01:12.290> wrong<00:01:12.620> with<00:01:12.860> it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
I might go and see what's wrong with it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.300 
I might go and see what's wrong with it
right<00:01:13.100> now

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
right now

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.120 
right now
it's<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.300> JD<00:01:15.200> welded<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.740> hole<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:16.070> the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
it's the JD welded the hole for the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.470 
it's the JD welded the hole for the
locking<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.760> didn't<00:01:16.910> stick<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.300> ring

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
locking so I didn't stick it in the ring

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.140 
locking so I didn't stick it in the ring
use<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.900> till<00:01:18.050> i<00:01:18.080> get<00:01:18.230> a<00:01:18.260> good<00:01:18.320> new<00:01:18.770> set<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.400> both

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
use it till i get a good new set of both

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.210 
use it till i get a good new set of both
this<00:01:20.420> may<00:01:20.720> be<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:20.960> an<00:01:21.050> RCA<00:01:21.380> continue<00:01:21.980> that<00:01:22.100> way

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
this may be for an RCA continue that way

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.060 
this may be for an RCA continue that way
it's<00:01:22.370> actually<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.730> little<00:01:22.880> bit<00:01:22.970> tougher

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
it's actually a little bit tougher

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.440 
it's actually a little bit tougher
anyway<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.100> haven't<00:01:25.280> cruise<00:01:25.610> around<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:26.090> arrive

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
anyway I haven't cruise around to arrive

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
anyway I haven't cruise around to arrive
on<00:01:27.140> these<00:01:28.030> Hardy<00:01:29.030> ran<00:01:29.180> one<00:01:29.420> pack<00:01:34.000> but<00:01:35.000> they're

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
on these Hardy ran one pack but they're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.630 
on these Hardy ran one pack but they're
seven<00:01:35.690> point<00:01:35.870> two<00:01:35.900> twenty<00:01:36.620> million<00:01:37.190> bar<00:01:37.400> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
seven point two twenty million bar and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.940 
seven point two twenty million bar and
the<00:01:38.630> propolis<00:01:39.020> charger<00:01:39.530> they're<00:01:39.680> supposed<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the propolis charger they're supposed to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.460 
the propolis charger they're supposed to
know<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.430> trash<00:01:40.730> so<00:01:41.120> I<00:01:41.360> just<00:01:41.810> rigged<00:01:42.050> up<00:01:42.200> a

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
know is trash so I just rigged up a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.290 
know is trash so I just rigged up a
little<00:01:42.650> set<00:01:42.890> up<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.190> two<00:01:43.340> wires<00:01:43.580> running

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
little set up with two wires running

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.090 
little set up with two wires running
from<00:01:44.450> my<00:01:44.870> tamiya<00:01:45.200> connector<00:01:45.290> all<00:01:45.740> my<00:01:45.890> few

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
from my tamiya connector all my few

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100 
from my tamiya connector all my few
charger<00:01:46.520> through<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.300> Dean<00:01:47.480> Specter<00:01:47.810> on

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
charger through the Dean Specter on

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.250 
charger through the Dean Specter on
these<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:50.409> they<00:01:51.409> charge<00:01:51.680> twice<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:51.980> fast<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.659> I

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
these and they charge twice as fast so I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.020 
these and they charge twice as fast so I
guess<00:01:55.190> I'll<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:55.430> get<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.730> some<00:01:55.820> lines

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
guess I'll just get you some lines

00:01:56.030 --> 00:03:40.089 
guess I'll just get you some lines
there's<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.659> much

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.830
