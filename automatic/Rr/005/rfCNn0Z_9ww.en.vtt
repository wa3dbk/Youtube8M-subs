00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
slice a lemon and a lime we're going to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.880 
slice a lemon and a lime we're going to
fold<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.759> over<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:11.110> important<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.709> go

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
fold this over and it's important to go

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.339 
fold this over and it's important to go
around<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.610> heart<00:02:12.910> down<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.629> end<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
around the heart down to the end of the

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.180 
around the heart down to the end of the
heart<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.890> you're<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.549> fold<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:16.150> over

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
heart and you're going to fold it over

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:35.009 
heart and you're going to fold it over
tightly<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.790> when<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> get<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> end<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
tightly then when you get to the end you

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.350 
tightly then when you get to the end you
really<00:02:35.590> want<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.890> make<00:02:36.010> sure<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:37.090> take<00:02:37.299> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
really want to make sure you take the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
really want to make sure you take the
tip<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.110> fold<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> under<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:41.019> holds

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
tip and fold it under and that holds

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.750 
tip and fold it under and that holds
this<00:02:41.890> pocket<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.680> keeps<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.250> steam<00:02:45.519> in

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
this pocket so it keeps the steam in

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.430 
this pocket so it keeps the steam in
there<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.239> then<00:02:46.660> I'm<00:02:46.780> also<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> show

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
there and then I'm also going to show

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.650

you<00:02:47.500> how<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.739> do<00:02:47.950> how<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.700> when<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.510> the
