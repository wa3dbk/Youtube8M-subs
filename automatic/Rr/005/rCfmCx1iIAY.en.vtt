zone and closed above that level so that

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.350 
zone and closed above that level so that

support that nice strong level there it

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.300 
support that nice strong level there it
held<00:01:21.730> above<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.150> level<00:01:22.360> now<00:01:23.200> based<00:01:24.010> on<00:01:24.190> our

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310

uptrend resuming itself and that could
present<00:01:51.280> some<00:01:51.670> really<00:01:52.030> good<00:01:52.120> opportunities

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
present some really good opportunities

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.410 
present some really good opportunities
either<00:01:53.830> on<00:01:53.980> this<00:01:54.190> timeframe<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.910> drilling

final session of the week is that I'm
going<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.240> be<00:02:01.300> looking<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.750> breaks<00:02:01.990> at<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
going to be looking for breaks at the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.500

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
top of this bar and then trying to drill

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.940 
top of this bar and then trying to drill
down<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.720> lower<00:02:04.930> time<00:02:05.170> frames<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.560> find<00:02:05.770> good

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
down to lower time frames to find good

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.980 
down to lower time frames to find good
trading<00:02:06.280> opportunities<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.690> that's<00:02:07.840> my

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
trading opportunities so that's my

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.509 
trading opportunities so that's my

thoughts of silver and I think you know

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.160 
thoughts of silver and I think you know
there's<00:02:09.759> no<00:02:09.879> reason<00:02:10.179> why<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.330> can't<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.840> these

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
there's no reason why we can't see these

we're no longer an uptrend are we've got

lower low so we've got no trend there on

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.130 
lower low so we've got no trend there on

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
give me any clear direction yes I can

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.000 
give me any clear direction yes I can
drill<00:03:11.570> down<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.900> lower<00:03:12.080> timeframes<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.770> maybe

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
drill down to lower timeframes and maybe

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.840 
drill down to lower timeframes and maybe
go<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.489> look<00:03:13.550> at<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:15.640> four<00:03:16.640> hour

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
go and have a look at the the four hour

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.150 
go and have a look at the the four hour
or<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.060> one<00:03:17.300> hour<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:18.020> those<00:03:18.140> two<00:03:18.530> now

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
or the one hour but those two now

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.190 
or the one hour but those two now
they're<00:03:19.670> inbound<00:03:19.970> trends<00:03:20.420> as<00:03:20.540> opposed<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.080> the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
they're inbound trends as opposed to the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.590 
they're inbound trends as opposed to the
up<00:03:21.290> trends<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.549> don't<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.180> clear

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
up trends so I don't have that clear

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.110 
up trends so I don't have that clear
