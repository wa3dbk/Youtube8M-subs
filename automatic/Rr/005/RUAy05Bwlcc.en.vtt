00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
objects i get a massive speed boost

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.529 
objects i get a massive speed boost
which<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.280> helps<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> getting<00:00:45.090> getting

through the kind of boring spots on the
roofs<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> hopefully<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.340> fix<00:00:50.550> that

density but as you can see I kind of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
density but as you can see I kind of
melt<00:00:55.980> through<00:00:56.570> everything<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.989> comes

have the bracer the Reapers racers and I
would<00:01:29.250> replace<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> blood<00:01:30.030> vengeance

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
would replace the blood vengeance

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
would replace the blood vengeance
passive<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:30.930> something<00:01:31.229> different<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.130> the

speed boost that you get through these

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
speed boost that you get through these
is<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.930> incredible<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
given they were both garbage it would

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.429 
given they were both garbage it would
still<00:01:43.020> need<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> happen<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:44.369> damage<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.909> about

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439

850 something thousand while I'm moving

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
850 something thousand while I'm moving
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.290> whenever<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> know

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

luda chest or anything like that the
waist<00:01:52.680> guard<00:01:52.890> gives<00:01:53.070> me<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.399> 1.6<00:01:54.119> million

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
waist guard gives me about 1.6 million
damage<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.710> long<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.100> constantly

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
damage so as long as I'm constantly

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.920 
damage so as long as I'm constantly
leading<00:01:56.909> chests<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.329> stuff<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.689> my

leading chests and stuff like that my

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
leading chests and stuff like that my
dam<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.649> high<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.369> are

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
dam is just really high but there are

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.920 
dam is just really high but there are
some<00:01:59.670> areas<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.060> there's<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.509> much<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
some areas but there's not very much the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
some areas but there's not very much the
same<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.259> thing's<00:02:01.770> dilute<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.939> does<00:02:03.090> go

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
same this thing's dilute and it does go

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.999 
same this thing's dilute and it does go
kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> low<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.649> bit<00:02:04.740> take<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
kind of low and it's a little bit take a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
kind of low and it's a little bit take a
little<00:02:05.100> bit<00:02:05.219> longer<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> kill<00:02:05.700> things

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
little bit longer to kill things

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.480 
little bit longer to kill things
with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> coup<00:02:07.620> that<00:02:07.770> i'm<00:02:07.860> using<00:02:07.890> right<00:02:08.220> now<00:02:08.399> i

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
with the coup that i'm using right now i

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.699 
with the coup that i'm using right now i
think<00:02:08.640> i<00:02:08.880> have<00:02:08.990> about<00:02:09.990> fifty<00:02:10.470> five<00:02:10.679> percent

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
think i have about fifty five percent

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.660 
think i have about fifty five percent
increased<00:02:11.580> damage<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.600> strafe<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.980> between

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
increased damage to strafe with between

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.290 
increased damage to strafe with between
my<00:02:14.819> boots<00:02:15.090> my<00:02:15.420> home<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.400> my<00:02:17.400> bracers<00:02:18.120> give

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
my boots my home and my bracers give

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.120 
my boots my home and my bracers give
nineteen<00:02:18.750> percent<00:02:18.959> fire<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.620> i<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.770> i<00:02:19.830> think

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
nineteen percent fire so i have i think

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
nineteen percent fire so i have i think
around<00:02:20.220> fifty<00:02:20.670> five<00:02:20.819> percent<00:02:20.850> which<00:02:21.780> i<00:02:21.870> could

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
around fifty five percent which i could

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.290 
around fifty five percent which i could
be<00:02:22.200> getting<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> lot<00:02:22.740> more<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.489> quiver<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
be getting a lot more with a quiver and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.150 
be getting a lot more with a quiver and
like<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> sender<00:02:25.410> coat<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.800> things<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.100> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
like a sender coat and things like that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.979 
like a sender coat and things like that
our<00:02:26.580> mage<00:02:26.940> fist<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
our mage fist I think there are the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.260 
our mage fist I think there are the
gloves<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:29.100> right<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.850> still<00:02:30.060> need<00:02:30.209> to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
gloves but right now I still need to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.080 
gloves but right now I still need to
replace<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:30.750> those<00:02:30.989> items<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.940> have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
replace all those items so I still have

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.460 
replace all those items so I still have
a<00:02:33.120> lot<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> work<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.050> bill<00:02:34.230> but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
a lot to work for with the bill but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.620 
a lot to work for with the bill but
right<00:02:34.739> now<00:02:34.890> I'm<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:35.940> doing<00:02:36.180> pretty<00:02:36.330> good

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
right now I'm actually doing pretty good

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.449 
right now I'm actually doing pretty good
clear<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.050> torment<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> could<00:02:38.130> probably<00:02:38.280> do

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
clear in torment one I could probably do

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.110 
clear in torment one I could probably do
torm<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.239> pretty<00:02:39.540> easily<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.970> only

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
torm up to pretty easily but the only

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.030 
torm up to pretty easily but the only
thing<00:02:42.239> that's<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> bad<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.800> build

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
thing that's kind of bad with this build

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.740 
thing that's kind of bad with this build
is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.459> lot<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> time<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> be

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
is a lot of the time you have to be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.780 
is a lot of the time you have to be
right<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> action<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.430> there's<00:02:47.610> been<00:02:47.760> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
right in the action so there's been a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.820 
right in the action so there's been a
few<00:02:48.030> times<00:02:48.090> where<00:02:48.570> I've<00:02:48.750> got<00:02:49.260> stuck<00:02:49.680> with

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
few times where I've got stuck with

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.610 
few times where I've got stuck with
Wohlers<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.420> rooted<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.930> place<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
Wohlers or just rooted in place and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.550 
Wohlers or just rooted in place and
after<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.370> kill<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> mob<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.660> explosion<00:02:55.320> blasts

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
after I kill a mob the explosion blasts

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620 
after I kill a mob the explosion blasts
will<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:55.950> nearly<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.730> shot<00:02:57.030> me<00:02:57.209> then<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.450> just

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
will just nearly one shot me then I just

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.390 
will just nearly one shot me then I just
died<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.830> thing<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.100> need<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> work

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
died so that's one thing I need to work

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
died so that's one thing I need to work
on<00:02:59.489> my<00:02:59.550> toughness<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.180> little<00:03:00.450> bit<00:03:00.540> more<00:03:00.720> but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
on my toughness a little bit more but

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.580 
on my toughness a little bit more but
sometimes<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.489> hard<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.380> replace<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
sometimes it's it's hard to replace the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.970 
sometimes it's it's hard to replace the
toughness<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:06.290> sacrifice<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> damage<00:03:07.800> for

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
toughness or sacrifice the damage for

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.520 
toughness or sacrifice the damage for
more<00:03:08.130> timeless<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.239> hate<00:03:09.870> doing<00:03:10.080> I

more timeless you just I hate doing I
know<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> need<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.239> need<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> kind<00:03:12.510> of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
know you need to but you need to kind of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.530 
know you need to but you need to kind of
find<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.840> good<00:03:12.989> balance<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.769> build

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540

much<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.590> face<00:03:22.920> tank<00:03:23.190> everything<00:03:23.549> about

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
much just face tank everything about

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.430 
much just face tank everything about
this<00:03:23.850> build<00:03:24.090> which<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.570> think<00:03:24.900> would<00:03:24.989> be<00:03:25.140> okay

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
this build which I think would be okay

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680 
this build which I think would be okay
on<00:03:25.650> softcore<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.880> I'm<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.450> sure<00:03:27.480> about

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
on softcore but I'm not sure about

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.030 
on softcore but I'm not sure about
hardcore<00:03:28.140> i<00:03:28.290> don't<00:03:28.470> think<00:03:28.650> i've<00:03:28.739> been<00:03:28.769> using

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
hardcore i don't think i've been using

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.800 
hardcore i don't think i've been using
this<00:03:29.310> build<00:03:29.579> if<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.239> did<00:03:30.510> I'd<00:03:30.780> probably

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
this build if I did I'd probably

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.259 
this build if I did I'd probably
stacking<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> lot<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.519> lot<00:03:32.610> more<00:03:32.850> toughness

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
stacking a lot more a lot more toughness

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
stacking a lot more a lot more toughness
because<00:03:34.230> there's<00:03:34.410> been<00:03:34.500> quite<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.769> few<00:03:34.860> times

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
because there's been quite a few times

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.190 
because there's been quite a few times
where<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.549> get<00:03:35.910> where<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.140> could

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
where I just get where I think I could

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.870 
where I just get where I think I could
take<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.650> damage<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.280> I'm<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.579> kind<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
take the damage and I'm just kind of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.850 
take the damage and I'm just kind of
risk<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.440> die<00:03:40.560> too<00:03:41.220> stupid<00:03:41.430> things

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.910 

oh<00:03:45.300> right<00:03:46.300> up<00:03:46.480> here<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.960> a<00:03:46.990> channeling<00:03:47.650> pile

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
oh right up here I get a channeling pile

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.250 
oh right up here I get a channeling pile
on<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.490> I'm<00:03:48.610> able<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:49.000> spam<00:03:49.360> my<00:03:49.600> shadow<00:03:49.990> power

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
on so I'm able to spam my shadow power

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.050 
on so I'm able to spam my shadow power
and<00:03:50.500> get<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> constant<00:03:51.160> thirty<00:03:51.340> percent<00:03:51.670> moving

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and get a constant thirty percent moving

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.780 
and get a constant thirty percent moving
speed<00:03:52.300> boost<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.440> very<00:03:53.800> nice<00:03:54.310> also<00:03:54.760> I

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
speed boost this is very nice also I

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.030 
speed boost this is very nice also I
think<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.120> reduces<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.600> coulombs<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.860> i<00:03:56.890> can

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
think it reduces the coulombs so i can

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
think it reduces the coulombs so i can
have<00:03:57.220> vengeance<00:03:57.460> up<00:03:57.790> more<00:03:58.030> but<00:03:58.900> i<00:03:58.960> could<00:03:59.140> be

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
have vengeance up more but i could be

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.000 
have vengeance up more but i could be
wrong<00:03:59.290> with<00:03:59.530> me<00:03:59.620> but<00:04:00.930> i<00:04:01.930> think<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.410> little<00:04:02.620> like

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
wrong with me but i think a little like

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.370 
wrong with me but i think a little like
very<00:04:03.370> soon<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:05.010> get<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.040> movement<00:04:06.790> speed<00:04:07.380> shrine

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
very soon I get a movement speed shrine

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.860 
very soon I get a movement speed shrine
to<00:04:08.680> or<00:04:08.980> pylon<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.610> then<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.210> just<00:04:10.360> going<00:04:10.570> just
