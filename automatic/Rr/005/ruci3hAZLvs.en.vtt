00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 this time if you stay with me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.589
 I want to show you how to make this candle 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 or sand sailor stay with me 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.840
 come with me, I'll show you how 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.840
 makes 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.910
 paraffin sand scraped and pulverized a 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.790
 the empty container or a mold of your 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.790
 preference and petrolatum or petroleum jelly 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.250
 commonly known and ready 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.550
 let's take then as a first step 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 the mold and the petrolatum the best mind 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.690
 known as Vaseline 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 the function of the toilet is not going to be 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.290
 only 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.000
 as a demolded NHK 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.130
 in such a way that we're going to have to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.410
 treat it or we will have to apply 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.310
 in the entire inner face of our 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.530
 mold 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.870
 in this way in a uniform way 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.570
 until we leave it well covered this we 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.450
 will obviously allow the end to unmold 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.860
 our candle without being able to adhere to 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.290
 our container 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.930
 does not make the next step easy 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.270
 then it will take the flour and the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.290
 paraffin our wick also by 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.810
 supposed 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.810
 what we will do is very simple we are going to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 take the paraffin scraped or powdered 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.370
 depending on the case if you can 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 getting pulverized is perfect but 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.990
 In case it is not possible you can 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.460
 drag a candle that you have or that already 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.140
 do not use the ones that usually 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.150
 We use at home when the light goes out 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.400
 well what we are going to do then it will be 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.680
 take this container and then do not get 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.200
 to the microwave with a few seconds if 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.330
 it is necessary we put it back not you 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 I give an exact amount of time because 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.190
 it really is very relative but already with 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.830
 the process until you see completely 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.479
 the liquid will then suffice 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.220
 time this is liquid what we are going to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.440
 do is the following once hot 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.840
 to remove the paraffin it will be necessary to go 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.400
 mixing the flour little by little to go 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 forming a mixture that I recommend that 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.790
 protect your hands at the moment of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.250
 remove the paraffin from the microwave 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.340
 melted because it tends to get very 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.440
 hot and you can burn yourself once 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.510
 let's have all the paraffin mixed with 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.489
 all the flour will need to be left 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.720
 a uniform mixture that we realize 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.670
 that the area 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.220
 has been completely wet we are going to 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.830
 go squeezing a bit so it's done 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.350
 a smooth or even surface of this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.080
 way with the help of another container in 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.030
 this case is the lid of an aerosol what 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.440
 let's also grease some of this 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.050
 way you can use any 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.470
 The idea is good, so be it 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 schilling lico in this way the circle 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.120
 to be able to introduce it under pressure and that 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 we have a small depth in the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 center well let's leave then that 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.270
 set or solidify and subsequently 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.610
 let's unmold and well once you have 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.280
 solidified then it will be necessary to 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.990
 welding is a very simple thing this 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.630
 unmold because good as we already apply 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.790
 Vaseline or petrolatum before or 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.440
 previously it is at the time of dismantling not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.540
 it will cost you a lot of work what I have 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.570
 done finally to give it over 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.730
 more rustic is that scraped all the 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.770
 you see it with a knife with 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.330
 tooth I've done it good to give it 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.000
 a little more rustic finish for 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.220
 piedrecillas keys that stick out and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.990
 so that it is finished more future and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.390
 well finally what we are looking for 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.640
 is that of that appearance of sand 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.200
 grainy mind and web place then 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.020
 the surface 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.150
 or our little world of flour for 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.220
 turn it into a candle by putting the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.959
 foot and those for that we will use a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.060
 hairpin and that of doubled I have 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.340
 said completely straight so that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.349
 cover the entire width of the sail or 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.840
 We will place the surface in the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.510
 center for this let's take the wick 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.069
 as you see and we will hold another form 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.160
 to do it and also that we also 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.110
 will save time is to place the family and 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.720
 of the same access that we have already subtracted 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.849
 paraffin that we have already scraped put 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.650
 a little bit around this way and what 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.660
 we will tighten this could be another way and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.269
 it would also help us to save the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.280
 paraffin because you could have given yourself 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.959
 account if you reached this point that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.340
 melt the slope a little bit of work 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.870
 and it takes a bit if you put it in 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.510
 microwave will need to be 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.160
 withdrawing and moving constantly to 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.579
 that your mold or container where it is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.410
 melting, do not go to that once 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.420
 subject the wick in this way we go 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.080
 so now I can put a little bit of 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.080
 melted 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.540
 find out enough 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.370
 up there is perfect just fine 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.370
 subtract then wait for 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.470
 solidify again issue of 20 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.560
 minutes more or less and good finally 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.540
 this is the end result the part 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.540
 outside and inside
