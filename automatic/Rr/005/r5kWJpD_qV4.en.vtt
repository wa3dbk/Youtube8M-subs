signals for my main hand weapon so I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.030 
signals for my main hand weapon so I
needed<00:00:32.640> only<00:00:32.940> 2<00:00:33.329> mod<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.050> happened<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
needed only 2 mod so what happened is I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.780 
needed only 2 mod so what happened is I
I<00:00:35.579> used<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.239> sexta<00:00:36.750> scheme<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:38.070> got<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I used a sexta scheme and I got a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
I used a sexta scheme and I got a
sexless<00:00:39.510> signet<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.860> means<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> point

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
sexless signet which means at this point

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
sexless signet which means at this point
I<00:00:41.910> only<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.719> signet<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.770> make<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.129> first

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
I only need one signet to make my first

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
I only need one signet to make my first
ascension<00:00:45.090> crossbow<00:00:45.510> while<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.170> main<00:00:46.350> hand

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
ascension crossbow while my main hand

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.880 
ascension crossbow while my main hand
ascension<00:00:47.309> crossbow<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.809> only<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
ascension crossbow now not only that but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
ascension crossbow now not only that but
after<00:00:50.129> camping<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.840> more

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
after camping for a little bit more

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.979 
after camping for a little bit more
because<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.710> more<00:00:52.949> sex<00:00:53.370> keys<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.690> fact

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
because I had more sex keys I in fact

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.639 
because I had more sex keys I in fact
got<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.379> second<00:00:56.000> sexless<00:00:57.140> signet<00:00:58.140> which<00:00:58.350> means

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
got a second sexless signet which means

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.849 
got a second sexless signet which means
at<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.920> point<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.579> need<00:01:00.000> 2<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.140> signals<00:01:01.680> for

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
at this point I need 2 more signals for

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
at this point I need 2 more signals for
my<00:01:02.070> often<00:01:02.489> version<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:03.780> close<00:01:04.019> for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
my often version some very close for

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
my often version some very close for
both<00:01:04.619> main<00:01:04.979> hand<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> often<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.240> point

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
both main hand and often at this point

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.219 
both main hand and often at this point
and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.799> also<00:01:08.010> used<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> keys<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.080> too

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and I also used all of the keys but too

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
and I also used all of the keys but too
much<00:01:10.380> except<00:01:10.890> Quinta's<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:11.820> are

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
much except Quinta's because those are

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
much except Quinta's because those are
very<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.630> annoying<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.350> those<00:01:13.560> were

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
very very annoying you know those were

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
very very annoying you know those were
the<00:01:13.920> lasers<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> ground<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.110> don't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the lasers on the ground I kind of don't

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
the lasers on the ground I kind of don't
like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.400> did<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> mainly

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like that but I did use all of it mainly

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
like that but I did use all of it mainly
for<00:01:20.000> snapdragon<00:01:21.000> seeds<00:01:21.270> wait<00:01:21.930> actually<00:01:22.110> those

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
for snapdragon seeds wait actually those

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.249 
for snapdragon seeds wait actually those
had<00:01:22.920> helps<00:01:23.310> nut<00:01:23.549> seeds<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.030> would<00:01:24.299> say<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
had helps nut seeds I would say it was a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.830 
had helps nut seeds I would say it was a
big<00:01:25.680> success<00:01:25.920> even<00:01:26.490> though<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> camped<00:01:27.479> pretty

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
big success even though I camped pretty

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
big success even though I camped pretty
much<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> week<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.430> only<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
much for like a week and I only got one

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.109 
much for like a week and I only got one
signal<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.380> signet<00:01:31.920> meant<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.939> lot

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
signal but that one signet meant a lot

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.760 
signal but that one signet meant a lot
because<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.689> much<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.140> point<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.619> only

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because pretty much at this point I only

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.730 
because pretty much at this point I only
need<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.670> I'll<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.180> done<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> way

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
need one and I'll be done and by the way

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.240 
need one and I'll be done and by the way
I<00:01:37.770> destroyed<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.579> chaotic<00:01:39.140> crossbow<00:01:40.250> because

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I destroyed my chaotic crossbow because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
I destroyed my chaotic crossbow because
I<00:01:41.369> wanted<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.180> tokens<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
I wanted to get some tokens back and I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
I wanted to get some tokens back and I
never<00:01:43.799> use<00:01:44.070> chaotix<00:01:44.549> anyway<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.060> used<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.479> role

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
never use chaotix anyway I used my role

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800 
never use chaotix anyway I used my role
crossbow<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.860> did<00:01:47.220> keep<00:01:47.460> offhand<00:01:48.090> er<00:01:48.689> the

crossbow but I did keep offhand er the
crossbow<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.829> case<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.640> main<00:01:50.909> hand

then finally I got to 91 hell-blood

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.850 
then finally I got to 91 hell-blood
which<00:02:15.090> means<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.629> make<00:02:15.750> overloads<00:02:16.379> if<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
which means I can make overloads if I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.240 
which means I can make overloads if I
use<00:02:17.040> spices<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.090> boost<00:02:18.300> +5<00:02:19.050> hair<00:02:19.379> blood<00:02:19.620> in

total<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.910> made<00:02:21.060> 97<00:02:21.690> overloads<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.920> combine

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
total I made 97 overloads then I combine

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.809 
total I made 97 overloads then I combine
them<00:02:23.550> into<00:02:23.760> flasks<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.629> was<00:02:24.900> 48<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:26.220> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
them into flasks which was 48 I think so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.630 
them into flasks which was 48 I think so
I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.239> I'm<00:02:28.019> put<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.620> set<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.160> overloads

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
I think I'm put it is set for overloads

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.990 
I think I'm put it is set for overloads
that's<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:31.319> 100<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.190> oxy<00:02:32.580> kills<00:02:32.790> or

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that's what I think 100 are oxy kills or

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.570 
that's what I think 100 are oxy kills or
something<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.630> use<00:02:33.870> 3<00:02:34.410> dose<00:02:34.650> per<00:02:34.890> kills<00:02:35.250> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
something if I use 3 dose per kills I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.180 
something if I use 3 dose per kills I
have<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:36.360> said<00:02:36.660> anybody<00:02:37.110> which<00:02:37.500> provides<00:02:37.950> way

minute cooldown and for 10 seconds once

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.170 
minute cooldown and for 10 seconds once
you<00:03:04.170> activate<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.650> pretty<00:03:05.400> much<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.940> say

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you activate it pretty much we could say

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.990 
you activate it pretty much we could say
you<00:03:06.239> are<00:03:06.690> immune<00:03:07.079> from<00:03:07.110> damage<00:03:07.799> from<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.400> toxin

so let's say the whole fight takes 11
minutes<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:13.230> means<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.709> use<00:03:13.739> this

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
