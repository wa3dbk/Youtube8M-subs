just talk to you about some anatomy and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
just talk to you about some anatomy and
basically<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.580> Anatomy<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.150> got<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
basically with your Anatomy you got you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.080 
basically with your Anatomy you got you
you<00:00:28.050> need<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.859> inside<00:00:29.279> you've<00:00:29.460> got<00:00:29.699> your

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you need on the inside you've got your

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
you need on the inside you've got your
quite<00:00:30.900> wicked<00:00:31.289> type<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.830> muscles<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.309> VMO

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
quite wicked type of muscles your VMO

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.209 
quite wicked type of muscles your VMO
muscles<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> outside<00:00:34.620> you've

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
muscles and then on the outside you've

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.580 
muscles and then on the outside you've
got<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> stronger<00:00:36.149> bestest<00:00:36.570> lateralis<00:00:37.200> muscle

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
got a stronger bestest lateralis muscle

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.369 
got a stronger bestest lateralis muscle
and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.309> people<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.480> about<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.780> IT<00:00:39.960> band

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and then people think about the IT band

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040 
and then people think about the IT band
being<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> line<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.239> connective<00:00:42.629> tissue<00:00:42.809> up

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
being a line of connective tissue up

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.549 
being a line of connective tissue up
like<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> except<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
like this and it is like that except I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
like this and it is like that except I
like<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> picture<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> almost<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.329> collagen

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
like the picture it almost like collagen

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
like the picture it almost like collagen
fibers<00:00:49.230> around<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.070> leg<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.059> imagine

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
fibers around the leg and if you imagine

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
fibers around the leg and if you imagine
that<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.440> collagen<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.250> turns<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that the the collagen just turns at a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.080 
that the the collagen just turns at a
right<00:00:54.390> angle<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.680> inserts<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
right angle and then inserts in on the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
right angle and then inserts in on the
Linea<00:00:57.390> aspera<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> bone<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> side<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
Linea aspera that bone on the side of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.869 
Linea aspera that bone on the side of
your<00:00:59.280> your<00:01:00.030> leg<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:02.219> important

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
your your leg so are really important

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
your your leg so are really important
because<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.899> start<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> drag<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
because they will start to drag the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.090 
because they will start to drag the
kneecap<00:01:05.489> towards<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.390> outside<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
kneecap towards this outside and that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
kneecap towards this outside and that
can<00:01:08.340> end<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.299> patella<00:01:09.689> femoral

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
can end up with your patella femoral

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.010 
can end up with your patella femoral
pain<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:11.010> runners<00:01:11.310> knees<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.020> your

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pain that your runners knees and your

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
pain that your runners knees and your
your<00:01:13.680> jumpers<00:01:14.460> knees<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> those

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
your jumpers knees and all of those

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
your jumpers knees and all of those
types<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> overuse<00:01:16.530> injuries<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.060> we're<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
types of overuse injuries so we're just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
types of overuse injuries so we're just
going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.020> ang<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:23.189> can

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
going to get ang down and you can

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to get ang down and you can
basically<00:01:23.490> use<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> foam<00:01:24.090> roller<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
basically use the foam roller in a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
basically use the foam roller in a
couple<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> different<00:01:25.229> ways<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.799> use<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
couple of different ways you can use it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
couple of different ways you can use it
in<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.000> trigger<00:01:27.270> point<00:01:27.330> type<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> release<00:01:28.170> style

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
in a trigger point type of release style

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
in a trigger point type of release style
and<00:01:28.890> enters<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.729> showing<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and enters just showing you that now so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.690 
and enters just showing you that now so
she's<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> high<00:01:31.500> point<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.520> quite

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
she's got the high point so it's quite

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
she's got the high point so it's quite
high<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> hip<00:01:33.960> she's<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> sit<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
high up in the hip she's going to sit on

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
high up in the hip she's going to sit on
that<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.369> say<00:01:35.490> twenty<00:01:35.549> seconds<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.509> and

Angie is going to do three points and
that<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> main<00:01:44.250> trigger<00:01:44.520> points<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.210> IT

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that the main trigger points in your IT

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
that the main trigger points in your IT
band<00:01:45.770> are<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> high<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.450> little

band are the high one the one the little
little<00:01:49.470> nest<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.920> trigger<00:01:50.100> points<00:01:50.399> halfway

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
little nest of trigger points halfway

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.840 
little nest of trigger points halfway
down<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.770> she's<00:01:52.770> doing<00:01:52.920> those<00:01:53.130> right<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
down and she's doing those right now and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.230 
down and she's doing those right now and
then<00:01:54.270> she's<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> slide<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
then she's just going to slide it up and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
then she's just going to slide it up and
sit<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.299> those<00:01:57.600> little<00:01:58.020> distal<00:01:58.500> points<00:01:58.799> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
sit on those little distal points so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
sit on those little distal points so
that<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.430> above<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.299> knee<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.680> she'll<00:02:01.890> sit

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that just above the knee so she'll sit

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.690 
that just above the knee so she'll sit
on<00:02:02.219> those<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.850> 20<00:02:03.240> seconds

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
on those for about 20 seconds

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.480 
on those for about 20 seconds
age<00:02:04.289> then<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.560> other<00:02:05.710> way<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> use<00:02:06.159> your<00:02:06.280> foam

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
age then the other way to use your foam

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.969 
age then the other way to use your foam
roller<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.030> its<00:02:07.210> really<00:02:07.479> good<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.769> use<00:02:08.950> it

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
roller and its really good is to use it

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.559 
roller and its really good is to use it
in<00:02:09.190> almost<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.640> connected<00:02:10.119> tissue<00:02:10.239> type

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
in almost like a connected tissue type

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.479 
in almost like a connected tissue type
of<00:02:10.660> release<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.410> what<00:02:11.800> ang<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.099> going<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> do

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
of release so what ang is going to do

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.420 
of release so what ang is going to do
here<00:02:12.760> just<00:02:13.510> show<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.860> she's<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
here just show you and she's going to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.160 
here just show you and she's going to
sit<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.879> spot<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.330> she's<00:02:16.510> high<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.989> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
sit on that spot so she's high up and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
sit on that spot so she's high up and
she's<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.010> sustain<00:02:18.790> pressure

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
she's just going to sustain pressure

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.110 
she's just going to sustain pressure
roll<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.470> out<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:21.430> she's<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.670> going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> go

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
roll that out so she's just going to go

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.710 
roll that out so she's just going to go
slowly<00:02:22.480> through<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:25.150> she'll<00:02:25.390> feel<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
slowly through and what she'll feel it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.240 
slowly through and what she'll feel it
she'll<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.530> trigger<00:02:26.769> point<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.040> trigger

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
she'll go from trigger point to trigger

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.640 
she'll go from trigger point to trigger
point<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:28.209> can't<00:02:28.599> see<00:02:28.780> her<00:02:28.930> face<00:02:28.959> you'd<00:02:29.470> know

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
point you can't see her face you'd know

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.490 
point you can't see her face you'd know
and<00:02:30.390> she'll<00:02:31.390> take<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.750> right<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.230> down

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
and she'll take that right the way down

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.710 
and she'll take that right the way down
so<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.400> lateral<00:02:33.910> fibers<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.540> like

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
so that's the lateral fibers that's like

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.039 
so that's the lateral fibers that's like
the<00:02:34.840> outside<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.500> her<00:02:35.860> leg<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.750> now<00:02:37.750> what

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
the outside of her leg and now what

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.680 
the outside of her leg and now what
she's<00:02:38.260> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:40.030> roll<00:02:40.510> forward

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
she's going to do is just roll forward

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.770 
she's going to do is just roll forward
slightly<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.700> start<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.060> pick<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
slightly and just start to pick up that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.309 
slightly and just start to pick up that
sort<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.829> front<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.730> towards<00:02:46.720> aside<00:02:47.049> so

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
sort of front and towards aside so

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.789 
sort of front and towards aside so
anterolateral<00:02:47.739> sort<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.549> edge<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:49.180> fibers<00:02:50.140> so

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
anterolateral sort of edge of fibers so

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.780 
anterolateral sort of edge of fibers so
again<00:02:51.250> she's<00:02:52.030> picking<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:52.980> ITB<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> tear<00:02:54.549> fell

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
again she's picking up ITB and tear fell

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.000 
again she's picking up ITB and tear fell
but<00:02:55.599> she'll<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.840> picking<00:02:56.440> up<00:02:56.560> some<00:02:56.829> of<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
but she'll be picking up some of the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.270 
but she'll be picking up some of the
lateral<00:02:57.430> quad<00:02:57.940> muscles<00:02:58.450> there<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.989> well<00:02:59.470> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
lateral quad muscles there as well so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580 
lateral quad muscles there as well so
connective<00:03:00.970> tissue<00:03:01.269> type<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.750> release<00:03:02.019> firm

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
connective tissue type of release firm

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.190 
connective tissue type of release firm
pressure<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:04.060> slow<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:06.900> she's<00:03:07.900> rolled

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
pressure and really slow so she's rolled

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
pressure and really slow so she's rolled
that<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.950> now<00:03:09.100> she's<00:03:09.340> going<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.670> do<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
that out and now she's going to do the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.309 
that out and now she's going to do the
back<00:03:10.299> section<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.170> she's<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.930> arching

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
back section so she's so just arching

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.670 
back section so she's so just arching
the<00:03:14.709> other<00:03:15.100> way<00:03:15.359> so<00:03:16.359> pressure<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.530> go

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
the other way so pressure is going to go

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.199 
the other way so pressure is going to go
on<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.040> post<00:03:18.940> road<00:03:19.120> lateral<00:03:19.600> edge<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:21.209> she's

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
on that post road lateral edge and she's

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.699 
on that post road lateral edge and she's
going<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.569> firm<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.859> slow<00:03:24.549> through<00:03:25.090> and

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
going to go firm and slow through and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.199 
going to go firm and slow through and
then<00:03:26.709> she<00:03:26.829> might<00:03:27.010> even<00:03:27.040> drag<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.700> through<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
then she might even drag it through the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.599 
then she might even drag it through the
other<00:03:28.329> way<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.660> well<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.859> remember<00:03:30.069> guys<00:03:30.400> when

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
other way as well so remember guys when

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.890 
other way as well so remember guys when
you're<00:03:30.730> lengthening<00:03:30.910> at<00:03:31.239> your<00:03:31.420> connective

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
you're lengthening at your connective

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.930 
you're lengthening at your connective
tissue<00:03:32.109> or<00:03:32.319> your<00:03:32.500> collagen<00:03:33.040> fibers<00:03:33.489> it's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
tissue or your collagen fibers it's

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.620 
tissue or your collagen fibers it's
always<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.180> function<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.750> pressure<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.500> time

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
always a function of pressure and time

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.080 
always a function of pressure and time
so<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.840> really<00:03:38.260> good<00:03:38.799> way<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.100> start<00:03:39.760> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
so it's a really good way to start to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.910 
so it's a really good way to start to
really<00:03:40.810> release<00:03:41.139> that<00:03:41.350> outside<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.799> leg

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
really release that outside of the leg

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.569 
really release that outside of the leg
so<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.160> your<00:03:42.430> kneecap<00:03:42.970> tracks<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.959> lot<00:03:44.829> nicer

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
so that your kneecap tracks a lot nicer

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:53.400 
so that your kneecap tracks a lot nicer
has<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.209> feeling<00:03:50.340> okay<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.849> start<00:03:52.660> using<00:03:53.200> that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
has a feeling okay so start using that

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.170 
has a feeling okay so start using that
type<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.769> strategy<00:03:54.040> guys<00:03:54.400> as<00:03:54.579> foam<00:03:54.819> rollers

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
type of strategy guys as foam rollers

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.750 
type of strategy guys as foam rollers
are<00:03:55.329> really<00:03:55.690> awesome<00:03:55.930> little<00:03:56.319> tools<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
are really awesome little tools and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.539 
are really awesome little tools and
start<00:03:58.389> thinking<00:03:58.630> about<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.230> lateral<00:03:59.950> fibers

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
start thinking about the lateral fibers

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.280 
start thinking about the lateral fibers
sort<00:04:00.819> of<00:04:00.880> outside<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.450> league<00:04:01.599> start

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
sort of outside of the league start

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.550 
sort of outside of the league start
think<00:04:02.530> about<00:04:02.739> those<00:04:03.010> anterolateral

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
think about those anterolateral

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.280 
think about those anterolateral
so<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.370> outside<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.420> towards<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.750> front<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
so just outside up towards the front and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.460 
so just outside up towards the front and
then<00:04:07.739> get<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.069> back<00:04:08.430> ones<00:04:08.730> as<00:04:09.000> well<00:04:09.200> if<00:04:10.200> you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
then get the back ones as well if you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.370 
then get the back ones as well if you
start<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:10.860> use<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:12.150> couple<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.989> times<00:04:13.200> a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
start to use that a couple of times a

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.250 
start to use that a couple of times a
week<00:04:13.620> you'll<00:04:14.160> find<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:14.940> your<00:04:15.180> knee<00:04:15.420> start<00:04:16.079> to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
week you'll find that your knee start to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.560 
week you'll find that your knee start to
become<00:04:16.440> more<00:04:16.889> free<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.430> you'll<00:04:18.299> really

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
become more free and you'll really

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.000 
become more free and you'll really
prevent<00:04:19.049> those<00:04:19.230> overuse<00:04:19.829> injuries<00:04:20.340> long<00:04:20.700> term
