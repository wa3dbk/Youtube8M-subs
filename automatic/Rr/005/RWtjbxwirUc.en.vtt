00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:16.934
SNK Playmore exhibited "The King of Fighters XII", the latest installment in the King of Fighters series that is due to be released in April 2009, at the AOU2009 Amusement Expo.

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:39.133
This latest installment features a commemorative title that marks the 15th year since the birth of the King of Fighters series and was developed with incredibly detailed 2D graphics. All character animations were created as raster images rather than cel-shading, and took a lot of work to develop because 3D models were created and then rendered into raster images.

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.601
We're moving forward with developments
for an arcade game release in April,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:52.601
which is soon approaching, and we're actually
close to the reaching completed version.

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:57.968
Currently, we're right in the middle
of making the final adjustments.

00:00:57.968 --> 00:01:02.434
As you can see in a comparison
with the previous version,

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:10.067
we're readjusting the number of gages and
the game system, and in the rendering of graphics,

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:18.734
we've reinforced graphic representations of the knock-out
for example and of the portrayal of special moves.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.367
This game features a lineup of 20 characters including
classic characters from previous versions

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:35.834
as well as popular characters from the past
that were brought back with new graphics.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:45.100
For this installment, the developers were focused
on creating the ultimate fighting game,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.534
so this installment was developed with a complete
overhaul of the King of Fighters series

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:57.434
thus far and was developed with entirely
new graphics and game system features.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:02:03.801
Soon everyone will be able to enjoy the new
game at arcades throughout Japan and 

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.500
we're confident that it will be loads of fun.
