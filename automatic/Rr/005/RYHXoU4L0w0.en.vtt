way<00:02:37.490> I'd<00:02:37.610> we've<00:02:38.180> considered<00:02:38.830> traveling<00:02:39.830> with

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
way I'd we've considered traveling with

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
way I'd we've considered traveling with
pets<00:02:40.190> by<00:02:40.430> hair<00:02:40.700> but<00:02:40.910> I'd<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.360> very<00:02:41.540> nervous

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
pets by hair but I'd be very nervous

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.900 
pets by hair but I'd be very nervous
because<00:02:41.990> he<00:02:42.260> he's<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.740> little<00:02:42.890> too<00:02:43.070> big<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.760> fit

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
because he he's a little too big to fit

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.000 
because he he's a little too big to fit
underneath<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.390> seat<00:02:44.750> he<00:02:45.350> may<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.830> fly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
underneath the seat he may have to fly

underneath the seat he may have to fly
in<00:02:46.070> cargo<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.900> don't<00:02:48.050> know<00:02:48.110> how<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.290> gets

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
in cargo and I don't know how that gets

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.010 
in cargo and I don't know how that gets
handled<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.520> I'm<00:02:49.730> nervous<00:02:50.120> enough<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.720> planes

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
handled but I'm nervous enough on planes

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.370 
handled but I'm nervous enough on planes
I'd<00:02:51.920> hate<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.340> I'd<00:02:53.090> hate<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:54.170> what

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
I'd hate to I'd hate to think of what

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.620 
I'd hate to I'd hate to think of what
this<00:02:54.800> little<00:02:55.010> boy<00:02:55.220> would<00:02:55.430> think<00:02:55.700> down<00:02:56.390> there

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
this little boy would think down there

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.400 
this little boy would think down there
ok<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:57.770> anyway<00:02:58.010> moving<00:02:58.520> along<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.570> know<00:03:00.020> this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
ok so anyway moving along I know this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.140 
ok so anyway moving along I know this
may<00:03:00.560> sound<00:03:00.710> silly<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.100> research<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.790> type<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
may sound silly but research the type of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.390 
may sound silly but research the type of
