00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 today I bring you a network of same that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 we did my niece and I when he gave me 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.849
 for good the same high in sensors like 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.910
 I told them in previous lives can 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.730
 be psoe-to videos and he is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 helping good this time we did the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.760
 treasure that is thus bleached from below and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.570
 from above up in the same sun color 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.120
 good the materials that I like are 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.180
 chlorine or they also say it bleach in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.180
 other countries bleach mine that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 you this one that is sold here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.490
 in the store they sell us to clean or 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.160
 to wash clothes is called like that 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.680
 and then 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.680
 you may need a container 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.880
 well I say bucket I do not know how you 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 we throw their countries a container that is 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:12.090
 large enough for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 flowers and then wear gloves so that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.040
 protect in bloom or why not chlorine 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 it smells a bit more but then you 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.590
 this one is to knock down the chlorine and the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 water and good this depends on us 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.770
 We use 5 cups of this which is a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 third gas or 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.829
 and five of these and we put seven of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.829
 these chlorine depends on let's say when 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.409
 you want to have the plan that the sun will make 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.890
 so if you want to put some 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.170
 four glasses with six glasses of chlorine 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.170
 good saying that four glasses of water 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.570
 well let's start and the first thing that 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 I'm doing is good I forgot 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:14.460
 record the part where I put the water 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.610
 and now I'm putting the chlorine 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.690
 I put like 5 little glasses this is a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.620
 third 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.430
 of water and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 seven glasses right now is putting seven 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.950
 these glasses of chlorine 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.090
 he does not want to expose himself enough to 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.400
 cover the sun do not fill it up 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.290
 the recipient 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.780
 Well what I'm going to do right now is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.780
 put the sun little by little 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.620
 and as you can see I have a hand that is not 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.280
 touching the chlorine is because we do not want 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.970
 that the top is white 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.970
 as well 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 then I will continue like this putting a little 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.950
 bit 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.750
 well this I'm going to leave for about 30 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.200
 minutes and then I'll come back here you see 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.630
 like after 30 minutes and you see a 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.770
 little white already 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.770
 good I put him 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.880
 to hang it like that because it would not stop 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.910
 good but 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.910
 now here he knows after an hour 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.120
 the important thing is to rinse it in water 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.520
 First rinse it in cold water and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.020
 then hot or warm 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.020
 not very hot 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.820
 and then what I did is praise him and what 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.860
 I let it dry all night and dried 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.860
 the next day it was already dry 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.549
 washing it is important because we do not want to 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:49.349
 that the chlorine is dispersed everywhere 

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:53.459
 well that was all the video that 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:56.929
 like what I did with adults and I'm going to 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:00.079
 put more photos on the blog with the short 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:04.219
 and we will be perceived of achachicala 

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:04.219
 and you can also live
