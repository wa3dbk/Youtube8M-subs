think that about covers it people wanted

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.250 
think that about covers it people wanted
to<00:03:42.580> see<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.820> bunch<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.150> stats<00:03:43.390> inspects<00:03:44.080> so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
to see a bunch of stats inspects so

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.690 
to see a bunch of stats inspects so
there<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.190> have<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.400> hope<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.150> guys<00:03:46.300> enjoyed
