00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.520
 good as a last example of 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.010
 indications ep3 let's see the molecule 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.930
 of water we have studied the molecule 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.940
 of water from the repulsion model 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.910
 of the electronic pairs of the layer of 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.650
 valencia and we could easily reach 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.810
 the conclusion that the geometry of the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.970
 water has to be angular 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.310
 experimentally it is also known that the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.340
 link angle the water molecule is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 of 104 5 degrees nonetheless the one that 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.260
 we can deduce or predict this 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.570
 geometry from the model of 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.640
 percussion of electronic pairs if 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.249
 we want to go deeper into the link 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.710
 chemist we must resort to the evidence 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.629
 let's see why good first of all 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.290
 let's consider the configuration 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.720
 oxygen electronics 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.500
 oxygen as we know that the number 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.250
 atomic is equal to 8 and therefore its 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.320
 electronic configuration will be 1 s 2 2 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.170
 is 2 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.630
 2 p 4 that will be distributed from the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.140
 next way the students will be ice 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 the 2s orbital will also be full and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.310
 the 3 orbitals p 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 we will put the first three electrons 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.180
 of sap area two and a quarter paired of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.630
 this way what we see is that the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.549
 oxygen that has yes that matches the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.579
 number of covalent bonds that can 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.530
 form with those who in effect formed by 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.899
 what because it has two orbitals 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 seed beds with a single electron that go 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.039
 to be able to form covalent bond this is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 different from what happened in methane 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.470
 in which we should consider that one 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.299
 of the electrons passed or promoted 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.149
 an upper orbital to be able to form 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.740
 four links here this will not happen anymore 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.450
 we have explains the fact that the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.119
 oxygen can form two bonds 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.490
 covalent with two hydrogen atoms 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.319
 however if the oxygen forms in the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.200
 covalent bonds with the atoms of 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.409
 hydrogen using these orbitals 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 here this would be let's say the 2 of x2 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.790
 pz orders 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.990
 if you use these pure p orbitals such 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.730
 what are they like? 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.459
 remember that these orbitals between 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.459
 yes they form 90 degrees that is to say we would have 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 a 2x orbital arrives with a free pair of 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.760
 free electrons that we are going to clean 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 Y 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.730
 two others 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.940
 p2p orbitals and in two pesetas with a 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.620
 only electron that would be our could 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.680
 form link with hydrogens 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.349
 a link here by overlap and another 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.379
 link bring me if this was the way 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.299
 in which the water is forming the links 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.790
 covalent with the hydrogens since 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.920
 the orbitals have you among them 90 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.590
 degrees the angle of the water molecule 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.720
 it would also be 90 degrees but as 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.849
 we have said this is not so the angle of 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.940
 the water molecule is one hundred and 45 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.860
 degrees very similar or very close to 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.700
 angle of an irregular tetrahedron that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.670
 would be 109.5 then to be able 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.390
 explain the fact that the angle of the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.819
 water molecule is not 90 degrees but 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.970
 104.5 we have to resort again to 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.190
 the sp3 hybridization is going to happen as in 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.980
 the case of ammonia that are going to 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.020
 enable atomic orbitals that have 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.970
 couple 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.580
 they have electronic pairs that is 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.590
 that are already complete agree this 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.770
 can happen can hybrid and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.740
 atomic orbitals that are full only 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.450
 that then they will not form chemical bond 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.350
 therefore what we have now 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.780
 is that these orbitals here are going to 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.790
 forget to give an indication sp3 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.180
 because because it is formed by some 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.150
 vitals and three orbitals from this 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.450
 shape what we get will be the orbital 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.750
 9 stays the same 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.360
 and these four here are mixed because 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.370
 combine to result in four 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.799
 sp3 hybrid orbitals 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.319
 how did I solve starting darts 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.870
 like the peace orbitals and they had 6 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.090
 electrons in the hybrid orbitals that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.740
 we get we have to draw those 6 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.750
 electrons and therefore we will have 1 2 3 4 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.569
 5 and 6 as we see we have 4 hybrids two 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.120
 of them contain electronic pairs 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.710
 complete and two of them are semi 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.020
 filled with a single electron 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.389
 developed the four military 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.909
 sp3 hybrids as always they are going to 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.889
 dispose towards the vertices of a 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.389
 hypothetical will have inside what then 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.389
 we will have oxygen 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.900
 as oxygen 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.540
 surrounded by his hybrids of which only 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.080
 let's draw the largest lobe a thread 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.360
 sp3 another little book sp3 another one that will come 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.640
 will come out of the blackboard of fans 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.410
 a little bigger and another graffiti inside 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.520
 from the plane of the blackboard a little more 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.880
 small these four sp3 hybrids have 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.910
 one of them good two of them one for 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.280
 free 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.000
 and draw from here and two others 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.890
 of them have only one editor are 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.720
 these those who only have one 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.810
 electron those who will be able to form 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.590
 covalent bond with 1s orbitals 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.080
 of hydrogen then here we will have a 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.689
 link 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.360
 with a hydrogen 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:54.360
 and another link with others 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.200
 this would be the geometry of the molecule 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.940
 of water with the four sp3 Indians 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.700
 directed towards the vertices of 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.400
 tetrahedron as the links are a 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.660
 frontal overlap between a hybrid 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.040
 sp3 of oxygen and one is not hydrogen 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.040
 we'll say we have sigma links 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:21.819
 esp 3 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.159
 It's good and because the link angle does not 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.369
 is 109 as 5 degrees as it fits 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:31.950
 wait for a tetrahedron but this 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:37.529
 Link angle here is 104.5 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:40.619
 of the simplified molecule we have this 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.849
 I'll open another free pair this is an angle 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.099
 of 104 5 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.860
 because that good distortion of the 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.849
 same way that happened with the environment 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.610
 the free countries 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.709
 they exert a greater repulsion on 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.280
 parents that parents in the 

00:06:53.709 --> 00:07:00.970
 before us what we have 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.860
 is available to hybrids two 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.040
 of these hybrids for example these two 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.620
 they are hosting electronic pairs 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.080
 levels would be these two here are 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.910
 hosting free electronic pairs and 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.830
 these two are the ones that are linking 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.460
 to oxygen to hydrogen according to 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:22.419
 then these free pairs exert a 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.480
 greater repulsion over the couple bond 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:30.090
 test and this makes these parents in the 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:33.340
 arts because the free countries are 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:37.180
 contract they will contract to an angle 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.160
 of 104.5 degrees and this would be the 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:44.310
 geometry of the water molecule 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.310
 explained from the sp3 invitation
