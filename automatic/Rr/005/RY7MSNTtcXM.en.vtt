00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.510
 the snake 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 only born in the years 1905 1917 29 41 53 65 77 89 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.339
 2001 and 2003 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.429
 the serpent usually relies on his own judgment rather than on dicom advice 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 from outside and most often is that he is right 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.380
 the snake is a meat sign 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.400
 his life begins and ends in the triumph of the tragedy and although he denies it, it is very 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.390
 superstitious 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.790
 it is very unlikely that an asset of this century has money problems 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.630
 always get what you need 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.820
 in the case that suffered significant losses surely that situation 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.210
 it will not repeat itself since the snake learns easily 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.980
 can compensate for the losses at a surprising speed and in general 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.990
 business is very prudent 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.560
 it is possible that if a snake suffers extreme hardships in his youth 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.210
 I did not manage to overcome the dramas, which is why I can become a 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.040
 fanatized by greed 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.860
 by nature the snake is skeptical but try not to show it 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 When the snake is filled with anger and rage its hatred has no limits its 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.150
 disguised and silent enmity tends to stay deeply rooted 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.460
 his displeasure will manifest itself more in direct contempt than in an argument 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.990
 hot 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.290
 there is no way to anticipate the movements of the snake 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.440
 is always one step ahead of any premonition 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.760
 has the power to wait for the ideal and exact moment of revenge 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.890
 the snake woman of a classic and serene beauty 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.780
 with a calm and self-assured personality and although many times 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.300
 produces a totally different impression of indolence and laziness not 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.770
 has none of that 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 your brain is always working 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 the best companions for the snake will be the ox 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.490
 the rooster or the dragon 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.530
 you can also form good equipment with the rat the rabbit the goat and the dog 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 instead he must stay away from the tiger that may not appreciate his 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.789
 insight 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.929
 the horse will be a mediocre pair while the monkey's cunning will 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.349
 will face with the peculiar sagacity of the snake 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.629
 between two snakes prune a peaceful cohabitation but with the pig 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.569
 will not have much in common
