00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.610
 back to the channel we go with another of the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.470
 quick guides and as you asked me jce in 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.110
 comments from another guide 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 let's go with pantheon jungle and good 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.489
 we go there the first thing that we 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.350
 we will buy will be the hunter's machete 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.559
 three portions of life and the trinquet 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.930
 red and the vii that we are going to do is going to 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.420
 do in this order we're going to like the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.550
 machete to the stone we are not going to buy 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.750
 also boots as fast as possible 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.880
 to have a little more speed 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.989
 movement and arrive before the 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.239
 lines we're going to finish the object of 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.940
 jungle in the damage and here we will go to 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.890
 damage we will also finish the boots 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.350
 of jungle and let's start with a 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.860
 brutalizing later we will make a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 day more 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.070
 and when we can we will finish it in the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.590
 our brutalizing terminals and the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.430
 black blade and last few last 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.370
 words as part or deflates a lot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.130
 in law we're going to do something that we 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.500
 forgot to hold on and we are going to make a 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.870
 guardian angel the runes we're going to 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.760
 carry are going to be the one you are seeing in 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.560
 screen are the same as the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.200
 follow the name that I have placed on 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.810
 vice tower and it is the red of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.900
 penetration of armor the yellow 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.780
 of armor and the blue of resistance 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.960
 magical flat and the blue ones I carry three 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 of cooling reduction the fifths 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.600
 are of damage the material used are a 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.470
 21 90 taking advantage of the damage equal if 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.470
 you want you can remove 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.780
 dots four points of defense and 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.450
 you can put the if you want in reduction 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.970
 Cooling of the attack branch 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.040
 to still have a little more 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.040
 cooling reduction but as 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.660
 you are seeing on the moon we already have a 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.250
 2.5 percent reduction of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 cooling I think it is not necessary 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.070
 but let's shoot the video and 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.460
 Dancing matter I mention the pantheon is 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.100
 a meet that is very good in early and 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.770
 smith game but as I said in late 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.530
 it deflates a lot but one 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.810
 outrageous then when you go to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.209
 whiten if you can take both 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.709
 first great casualties and then when 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.870
 you're going to bleach if you can leave the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.880
 low to the perfect line normally 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.130
 with the wii that we are going to be able to 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.050
 kill one of carry to an application a 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.030
 support whenever they tie us that like 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.800
 can be a lioness a three of a single 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 combo that if we send a nose by 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.750
 there we are going to do this to him 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 and when you 're moving away from games by 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.650
 Of course we are going to try to give you 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.349
 all the basics we can 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.000
 and we are going to burst the completely 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.579
 because also if we lack a little bit 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.409
 Damage game like that I have to say 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.959

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.370
