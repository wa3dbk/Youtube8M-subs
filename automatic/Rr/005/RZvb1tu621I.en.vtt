00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
what will be probably the most more more

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.529

expensive<00:00:26.220> cards<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> abyss<00:00:26.939> rising<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
expensive cards out of abyss rising and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
expensive cards out of abyss rising and
some<00:00:27.990> people<00:00:28.230> were<00:00:28.320> talking<00:00:28.500> about<00:00:28.680> maybe<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
some people were talking about maybe a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.479 
some people were talking about maybe a
number<00:00:29.609> 19<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:30.599> abyss<00:00:30.810> rising<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.489> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
number 19 will be an abyss rising and it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.780 
number 19 will be an abyss rising and it
would<00:00:32.759> hopefully<00:00:33.059> make<00:00:33.600> sense<00:00:34.640> I've<00:00:35.640> been

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
would hopefully make sense I've been

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.010 
would hopefully make sense I've been
wondering<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> long<00:00:36.600> time<00:00:36.660> though

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
wondering this for a long time though

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
wondering this for a long time though
when<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.860> number<00:00:38.190> 19<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
when are we going to get number 19 and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
when are we going to get number 19 and
number<00:00:39.210> 61<00:00:39.840> had<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:40.829> were<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> course<00:00:41.399> in

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
number 61 had these were of course in

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
number 61 had these were of course in
the<00:00:41.730> Yuma<00:00:42.000> pack<00:00:42.180> had<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.960> has<00:00:43.200> probably<00:00:43.800> been

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the Yuma pack had this has probably been

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
the Yuma pack had this has probably been
at<00:00:44.280> least<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.940> year<00:00:45.390> they've<00:00:45.570> been<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.870> in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
source I guess out of the two but they
both<00:00:55.710> need<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.070> printed<00:00:56.430> over<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.820> as

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.260 
both need to get printed over here as
you<00:00:58.020> may<00:00:58.680> remember<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.129> didn't<00:00:59.460> opening<00:00:59.820> even<00:01:00.180> a

long time ago and I got these two and i
just<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:05.880> understand<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.510> have

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just don't understand what we don't have

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
just don't understand what we don't have
them<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.780> English<00:01:07.140> yet<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:07.920> they're<00:01:08.070> both

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
them in English yet I mean they're both

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.149 
them in English yet I mean they're both
awesome<00:01:08.630> my<00:01:09.630> theory<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.650> hoping<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
awesome my theory and I'm hoping that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
awesome my theory and I'm hoping that
I'm<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.909> since<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.200> water

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
I'm right about this since one is water

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.910 
I'm right about this since one is water
attribute<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> other<00:01:14.520> words<00:01:14.670> fire<00:01:14.970> maybe

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
attribute and the other words fire maybe

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
attribute and the other words fire maybe
number<00:01:16.920> 19<00:01:17.250> featured<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.090> come<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
number 19 featured on will come out and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.310 
number 19 featured on will come out and
abyss<00:01:18.900> rising<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> no<00:01:19.799> cgt<00:01:20.240> import<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> then

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
abyss rising as a no cgt import and then

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.370 
abyss rising as a no cgt import and then
and<00:01:22.920> cosmo<00:01:23.280> blazer<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.180> number<00:01:24.479> 61<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and cosmo blazer will get number 61 of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609 
and cosmo blazer will get number 61 of
all<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> source<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:27.119> an<00:01:27.450> OC<00:01:27.930> g<00:01:28.110> import

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
all kind of source and as an OC g import

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.920 
all kind of source and as an OC g import
as<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:28.950> i<00:01:29.270> really<00:01:30.270> hope<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> case

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
as well i really hope this is the case

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.840 
as well i really hope this is the case
it<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.470> guess<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.159> doesn't<00:01:32.340> look<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.610> we're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it I guess it doesn't look like we're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
it I guess it doesn't look like we're
gonna<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.210> getting<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.630> Yuma<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
gonna be getting the Yuma back which is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.859 
gonna be getting the Yuma back which is
a<00:01:35.280> real<00:01:35.579> downer<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.299> i<00:01:36.329> mean<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a real downer really i mean because that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.149
