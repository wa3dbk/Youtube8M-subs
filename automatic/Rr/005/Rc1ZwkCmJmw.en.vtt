halfway<00:04:20.530> up<00:04:20.709> with<00:04:20.920> water<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.459> make<00:04:21.489> sure<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.240> get

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
halfway up with water to make sure I get

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.230 
halfway up with water to make sure I get
it<00:04:22.450> nice<00:04:22.900> you're<00:04:23.170> shooting<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:24.310> looks<00:04:24.520> messy

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it nice you're shooting this looks messy

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.320 
it nice you're shooting this looks messy
I<00:04:25.530> mean<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.620> mud<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.100> it's<00:04:27.250> messy<00:04:27.580> okay<00:04:28.270> so

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
I mean it's mud so it's messy okay so

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.380 
I mean it's mud so it's messy okay so
basically<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:30.730> reason<00:04:30.880> I'm<00:04:31.090> going<00:04:31.180> is

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
basically the reason I'm going is

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.000 
basically the reason I'm going is
applicator<00:04:31.900> bottle<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.530> just<00:04:32.590> cuz<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.980> makes

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
applicator bottle is just cuz it makes

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.520 
applicator bottle is just cuz it makes
it<00:04:33.250> really<00:04:33.430> easy<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.970> apply<00:04:34.450> directly<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.170> my

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
it really easy to apply directly to my

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.130 
it really easy to apply directly to my
scalp<00:04:35.800> which<00:04:36.760> is<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.150> I'm<00:04:37.270> going<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.660> do<00:04:40.140> now

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
scalp which is what I'm going to do now

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.780 
scalp which is what I'm going to do now
I<00:04:41.170> would<00:04:41.410> normally<00:04:41.560> be<00:04:41.950> doing<00:04:42.190> this<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
I would normally be doing this in the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.880 
I would normally be doing this in the
shower<00:04:43.090> then<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:43.960> would<00:04:44.080> print<00:04:44.320> some<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.680> my

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
shower then it would print some of my

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.300 
shower then it would print some of my
deep<00:04:45.070> conditioner<00:04:45.580> off<00:04:45.790> as<00:04:46.420> well<00:04:47.310> but

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
deep conditioner off as well but

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.370 
deep conditioner off as well but
basically<00:04:48.730> I'm<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.950> making<00:04:50.950> sure<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.220> get<00:04:52.380> all

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
basically I'm just making sure I get all

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:04.670 
basically I'm just making sure I get all
my<00:04:53.440> Scout<00:04:54.040> nice<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:59.200> know<00:05:00.180> clay<00:05:01.180> muddy

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.450 

and<00:05:05.790> then<00:05:06.790> once<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.510> have<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.200> think<00:05:08.460> buddy

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
and then once you have it I think buddy

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.790 
and then once you have it I think buddy
you<00:05:09.700> can<00:05:09.850> just<00:05:10.000> make<00:05:10.390> sure<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:10.780> use<00:05:11.140> just<00:05:11.680> the

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
you can just make sure you use just the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.640 
you can just make sure you use just the
tips<00:05:12.040> of<00:05:12.160> your<00:05:12.280> fingers<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.940> come<00:05:13.690> up<00:05:13.840> rub<00:05:14.530> it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
tips of your fingers to come up rub it

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
tips of your fingers to come up rub it
in<00:05:16.410> which<00:05:17.410> is<00:05:17.440> basically<00:05:17.920> what<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.190> did<00:05:18.280> when<00:05:18.580> I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
in which is basically what I did when I

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.650 
in which is basically what I did when I
shampoo<00:05:19.620> nothing<00:05:20.620> has<00:05:20.800> really<00:05:20.830> changed<00:05:24.660> and

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
shampoo nothing has really changed and

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.270 
shampoo nothing has really changed and
then<00:05:26.170> once<00:05:26.410> I'm<00:05:26.530> in<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.950> in<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.160> shower

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
then once I'm in this in the shower

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.090 
then once I'm in this in the shower
