00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 no 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.880
 I am gersois the cutter in the gers 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.440
 I am happy because Armagnac but 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.860
 this is the third year 70 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.320
 and you are sure all the communities 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.880
 of everyone being there it's true 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.560
 that there is notoriety of the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.280
 involvement of missions is called 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.020
 Love is in the meadow 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.060
 Besides, I met the woman who 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.310
 is not far from me and that's for sure 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.750
 it's a very strong authority 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.450
 friendly not stay above all the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.580
 farmers are trying to manage hi 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 very simple way and we have the advantage of 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.450
 live at the end of a path in a small 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.830
 town 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.200
 we also know go moment that his guests 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.040
 german another little boy 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.810
 the goal was really to show 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.840
 my job 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.400
 free before coming home 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.020
 sakho is uncomfortable and I thought 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.350
 if I am myself that I show my 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.299
 job 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.130
 I would not look like a redneck if 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.000
 I try to be someone else because 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.320
 that it's still pretty daunting 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 and finally I realized 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 that people will discover a terroir 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 production is not at all the goal 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.630
 what needed everything becomes the guide 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.820
 of gers 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.440
 it worked 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.440
 it's the break 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.920
 while a gers meets perigord 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.780
 it hurts so everyone in his area 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.370
 but here are gentlemen I could 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.410
 discover also to our terroir which is 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.840
 very interesting and even here but 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.520
 hello stone and fred and we invite all 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.520

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440
 or
