00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi guys is the panda touch welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.009
 another video of the veto is almost 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.540
 ending 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.280
 I'll catch up on the day. 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 Day 30 I promise 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.179
 Today's video to talk about five 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 books I wish they would turn 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.120
 movie still has to give a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 contextualization what I think of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.090
 adaptations there the adaptation 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 I always think that for 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 for a book to go green 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 film it needs or have a differential 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.000
 is for example of fantasies and dystopia 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.540
 world or he must have done it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 much success while the book is a theme 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 very strong to be debated from some 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 So you know I do not believe in much 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.050
 movies that are contemporary 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 contemporary subjects 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.199
 so between real 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.410
 This is how I do not see it because it turns into a movie and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.640
 and she was very disappointed with this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.160
 kind of movie because it's not funny 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.080
 I have what to expect from this movie is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.020
 really a few months 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.830
 of these books turns a movie sometimes makes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 success sometimes not so I looked it up 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.420
 pick up books that I really like that are 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 who has this world apart that has this 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.549
 that I spoke about a subject well 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 strong then let's go there the first book 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.509
 I wish it turned out film is ugly 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.600
 I know it 's scott westerfeld. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 bombing dystopia and turning movie more 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 it was one of the first books to have 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.470
 your rights bought and until today 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 has not been adapted and I think there is a lot 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 potential because it has several different types 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 different technology would be very 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 cool to see this movie and I think it 's a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 a cool topic to explore because 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.890
 despite being a fiction film 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 science would have a good theme 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 interesting to discuss with this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.290
 Beauty and the pursuit of beauty fight for 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 cause of this and this is finally there 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.049
 thing to do enough in this series and I 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.899
 I really wanted it to turn into a movie but it's 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.640
 difficult that it was no longer a great success 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.220
 literary another book that I would like 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 a lot that braz film is gone from michael 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.049
 blandy 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.870
 It would be much because they are children are 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.180
 young people and are trying to survive 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.189
 I love book love stories that perhaps 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.370
 talk about survival need 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:28.640
 survive a way and I found it very 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.780
 interesting this kind of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 discussion of how the young man 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.859
 survive without their parents and how they 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.569
 they will have to organize themselves 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.189
 I know that even planning more or less 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.920
 so it's yours 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.290
 are only young people in the career he 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.519
 already has to have some form to a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.739
 survival organization is from day to day. 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.170
 Not days like games that they will 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.209
 to the arena to kill himself but I think 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.819
 kony would look really cool I think 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.560
 they obviously would not use c 14 years 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.319
 here the maximum 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 probably they would have been older or 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.489
 the actors would be older but I 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.230
 I would love to think I turned movie 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.299
 that would be very nice to list 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.269
 Black obviously was not going to leave the talking 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.250
 not even because the team speaks 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.699
 always his goal but I think it's a theme 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.590
 important is that I turned film is 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.109
 I always defended this book to be looked at 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.329
 in schools if agreed you read 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.769
 all the possible people because I think 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.480
 which is an important theme is a theme that 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.949
 everyone needs to know know and discuss and 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.549
 I think it 's a movie that has a 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:41.449
 potential of leading many people to 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.879
 thinking about it is not expecting it 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:46.040
 that they read books in which they see 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.290
 The film begins to discuss 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.419
 I visual appeal of the film would be very 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.680
 Interesting because it found so much more 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.299
 I felt very strongly that he is not there to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.370
 turn film now more side 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.280
 fanciful wanted so much that they are spirited 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.139
 turn movie I think the movie here 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.919
 it's also very visual has all this 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:06.349
 thing of magic because here people are a 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.989
 society are in the monarchy 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.810
 only that there is a group of people who 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.709
 they have powers are the good trash they have 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.560
 a special skill so they just 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.289
 who are subordinate to the king and have or give 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.630
 klink's like the king of the animals he 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.080
 still subordinated to the king but all 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.689
 world 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.220
 It's my darkland, this is an appeal. 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.400
 very visual allows some disputes 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.159
 so one thing to stay are Bahia at last 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.370
 the presentations said that it would be very 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:41.240
 very very cool and visually speaking 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.330
 It's more like a movie for service, but 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.189
 has a political dispute that has this 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.650
 visual appeal I think to be very very 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.960
 very cool are gods too 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.599
 movie and finally I think 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.699
 would work fine for the movie until 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.190
 Even for the series, I remember it later. 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.210
 an ep your baby but he remembers that it is 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.430
 very good 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.889
 I need is the second this book is the 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.500
 incarcerated rose from the fornaci 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.870
 alexandre ropes a thousand and will talk about the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.449
 boy who was unjustly held there in the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.699
 England and all the adolescents who 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.620
 they get caught doing crime 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.680
 they are not sent to chairs 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.009
 but for a chain 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.620
 particular where someone cared about 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.180
 finally gives a correction for them but not 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.770
 letting the government know that they are 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.139
 sent to this chain only 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.180
 underground chain and there are many 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.889
 strange things in this chain and has 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.629
 a lot with this feeling of 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.580
 injustice because the boy was arrested 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.610
 unjustly he will try to escape 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.229
 no one can escape this chain 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.990
 You know I have a feeling means 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.289
 suffocated by the things that happen through 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.270
 book movie narrative is agonizing 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.610
 I think if it was movie stay 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.860
 very very cool to read these 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.729
 books you would like to see on the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.729
 Incarcerated cinema is spirited to the list 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.440
 good black and come tell me there in 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.419

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.620
