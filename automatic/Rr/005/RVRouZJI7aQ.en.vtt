to<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.740> leads<00:02:08.039> gives<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to that that this leads gives it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.449 
to that that this leads gives it
strength<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> keeps<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.929> keeps<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.530> animals

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
strength and keeps it keeps the animals

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.949 
strength and keeps it keeps the animals
for<00:02:11.670> me<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.890> one<00:02:16.890> area<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.280> another<00:02:17.959> so

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
for me like one one area to another so

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.369 
for me like one one area to another so
what<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.340> join<00:02:21.239> these<00:02:21.540> by<00:02:21.959> putting

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
what you do is you join these by putting

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.220 
what you do is you join these by putting
the<00:02:22.500> screws<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.310> from<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.299> pallet<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the screws in from this pallet in the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.479 
the screws in from this pallet in the
here<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.750> holds<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.829> pallet<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
here and that that holds this pallet to

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.360 
here and that that holds this pallet to
here<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.049> perpendicular<00:02:31.799> one<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> then

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
here to the perpendicular one and then

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.920 
here to the perpendicular one and then
you<00:02:32.519> use<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.239> next<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:35.370> next<00:02:35.400> slat<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.599> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
you use the next the next slat of this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.979 
you use the next the next slat of this
perpendicular<00:02:37.410> pallet<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.220> join<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.780> your

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
perpendicular pallet to join that your

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.430 
perpendicular pallet to join that your
next<00:02:40.200> two<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.420> follow<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.110> do

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
next two and so you just follow that do

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.720 
next two and so you just follow that do
that<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.769> way<00:02:43.890> around<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.670> said

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that all the way around and like I said

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.569 
that all the way around and like I said
usually<00:02:45.530> two<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.769> really<00:02:46.920> good

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
usually two is really good

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.000 
usually two is really good
two<00:02:47.849> for<00:02:48.390> every<00:02:48.540> perpendicular<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.769> can

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
two for every perpendicular but you can

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.400 
two for every perpendicular but you can
go<00:02:50.220> every<00:02:50.549> three<00:02:50.910> if<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.629> join<00:02:52.019> them<00:02:52.230> together

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
go every three if you join them together

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.530 
go every three if you join them together
really<00:02:52.920> well<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:54.420> suggest

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
really well but you I would suggest

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.220 
really well but you I would suggest
perking<00:02:55.530> straps<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.690> hinges<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.989> case

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
perking straps and hinges in that case

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.710 
perking straps and hinges in that case
and<00:02:58.769> other<00:02:58.980> than<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.579> just<00:02:59.609> joining<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
and other than that is just joining it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.949 
and other than that is just joining it
to<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:02.130> corners<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.000> buildings<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> need

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
to the corners of buildings if you need

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.220 
to the corners of buildings if you need
to<00:03:04.170> once<00:03:04.889> again<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.850> use<00:03:06.269> screws<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.139> in

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
to once again I just use screws and in

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.009 
to once again I just use screws and in
this<00:03:07.350> case<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.889> reclaim<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.090> as<00:03:09.359> Rosie<00:03:09.900> was

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
this case we reclaim this as Rosie was

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.360 
this case we reclaim this as Rosie was
saying<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.350> reclaimed<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.950> off<00:03:11.190> of

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
saying we reclaimed this off of

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.410 
saying we reclaimed this off of
Craigslist

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
Craigslist

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449

and<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:12.840> use<00:03:13.079> some<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.349> those<00:03:13.560> Habitat<00:03:14.430> for

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and I use some of those Habitat for

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.360 
and I use some of those Habitat for
Humanity<00:03:15.090> hinges<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.959> hang<00:03:16.139> it<00:03:16.290> right<00:03:17.099> here<00:03:17.340> on

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
Humanity hinges to hang it right here on

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.890 
Humanity hinges to hang it right here on
the<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:20.099> barn<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.060> goods<00:03:21.450> stay<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
the on the barn that the goods stay in

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.720 
the on the barn that the goods stay in
now<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.769> reason<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.099> put<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.310> one<00:03:23.459> together

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
now the reason we put this one together

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.309 
now the reason we put this one together
was<00:03:24.060> because<00:03:24.180> we<00:03:24.510> needed<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.780> separate<00:03:25.200> our

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
was because we needed to separate our

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.500 
was because we needed to separate our
females<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.430> gave<00:03:26.609> birth<00:03:26.910> these<00:03:27.090> are<00:03:27.269> two

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
in here because if you keep females who

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.430 
in here because if you keep females who
you're<00:03:32.819> milking<00:03:33.090> by<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.569> male's<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.230> mills

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
you're milking by the male's the mills

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.259 
you're milking by the male's the mills
make<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.799> goat<00:03:34.950> ate<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.400> goats<00:03:35.790> milk<00:03:35.970> tastes

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
make the goat ate the goats milk tastes

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.839 
make the goat ate the goats milk tastes
funny<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.620> we've<00:03:37.980> been<00:03:38.160> having<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.639> ever

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
funny so we've been having this ever

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.210 
funny so we've been having this ever
place<00:03:39.120> also<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.780> safety<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:41.040> baby

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
place also for the safety of the baby

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.720 
place also for the safety of the baby
goats<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.989> this<00:03:43.169> is<00:03:43.290> their<00:03:43.470> new<00:03:43.709> new<00:03:44.370> hangout

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.039 
goats so this is their new new hangout
what<00:03:44.940> another<00:03:45.359> thing<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.750> thought<00:03:45.989> I

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
what another thing that I thought I

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.309 
what another thing that I thought I
liked<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.530> those<00:03:47.099> interesting<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:48.319> when

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
liked about those interesting is when

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.740 
liked about those interesting is when
you're<00:03:49.440> on<00:03:49.470> when<00:03:49.859> you're<00:03:49.980> really<00:03:50.400> uneven

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you're on when you're really uneven

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.430 
you're on when you're really uneven
man<00:03:52.640> this<00:03:53.640> works<00:03:53.910> really<00:03:54.270> well<00:03:54.570> because<00:03:55.110> you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
man this works really well because you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.930 
man this works really well because you
can<00:03:57.830> section<00:03:58.830> at<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> time<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.520> then<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.790> don't

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
can section at a time and then you don't

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.220 
can section at a time and then you don't
have<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.210> worry<00:04:00.390> about<00:04:00.420> gaps<00:04:03.020> bottom<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
have to worry about gaps bottom of the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.470 
have to worry about gaps bottom of the
pallets<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.340> ground<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:05.970> it's<00:04:06.090> actually

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
pallets and the ground so it's actually

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.300 
pallets and the ground so it's actually
more<00:04:06.960> difficult<00:04:07.470> for<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.740> coats<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.100> get<00:04:08.190> out

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
more difficult for the coats to get out

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.610 
more difficult for the coats to get out
of<00:04:08.430> here<00:04:08.640> by<00:04:08.790> far<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.600> about<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.440> feel

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
of here by far than it is about the feel

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.470 
of here by far than it is about the feel
sense<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.220> they<00:04:11.340> will<00:04:11.820> dig<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.150> during<00:04:12.360> the
