00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 the most common bait snap 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
 for carp fishing is god 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.590
 literally translated from English word 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.810
 fight means cooked 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.849
 or boil that highlight technology 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.279
 cooking this bait boyle 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.989
 really cooked in Russia 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.619
 use boilies not only factory 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.850
 production 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 but also own cooking

 [music] 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.789
 boilies come in diameters of 6 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.480
 millimeters to 24 which determines 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.910
 diameter 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.160
 but usually six millimeter most 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 small boyle they are designed to catch 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 not even carp other white fish eat 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.129
 lovers of catching bream crucian with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.339
 the same 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 snap for this here are the smallest years 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.930
 starting from the 10 to the diameter is already 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.880
 boil carp though even at 14 16 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.460
 diameter quite often biting bream 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.149
 it is necessary to begin of course with small boiloff 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 there is an attempt to catch a diameter of 12-14 but 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.000
 if you are hampered by another white fish there in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.619
 including lie punished and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.159
 no carp bites it is better to go 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.590
 for larger diameters which are different 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.190
 the fish can no longer pay unlike 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.179
 carp about smells mean in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.030
 Mostly here all boilies and not their 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.640
 can be divided into two categories on 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.190
 the basis of which they are made is one 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.569
 the category it was with fruit 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 various flavors based on 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.959
 from semolina corn grits with different 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.979
 additives and the second category is boilies with 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.630
 such an animal smell the smell of fish with 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240
 the smell of shells 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.640
 motel which is usually 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.459
 made on the fish meal here this 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.739
 two options for what to use 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.989
 quite difficult to say it is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.569
 depends on the time of year and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.150
 water temperature and on what kind of water in 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.849
 what's the acidity of the pond what's her 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.160
 composition that is fish can 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.680
 prefer them even sometimes 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.300
 that in one reservoir fish prefers with 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.209
 in the morning some smells when the water gets warm 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.910
 others that's why here is such 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.870
 endless search process great 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 satisfaction 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.680
 find clues catch 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.260
 Cunning big fish besides boilov can 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.630
 use such traditional nozzles 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.880
 and on the same in the hair but I once again 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.500
 I will say that the advantage of hair is that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.920
 the hook remains open 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 that is, the fish during the bite are not afraid of it 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.520
 not scared leash she is not afraid of pulling in 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.080
 in itself the nozzle 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.110
 hook it just already automatically 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 flies in your mouth and when you try to jump 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.530
 he back to the cube the fish is caught then 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.960
 there is nothing worrying her therefore 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.410
 the same traditional nozzles as 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.250
 corn lupine even worms can 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.990
 put on hair well defined there 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.630
 make a stop so that they do not 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.790
 even the same worms slid over their hair 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.280
 they live much longer than on the hook and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.090
 plus again is that fish is like 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.610
 she is not frightened from the hook it to her 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.910
 does not interfere with ingestion 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.490
 minus these nozzles are quite soft here 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.470
 like corn worms it is of course good 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.850
 Naturally nozzles but minus them watts 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.520
 in the fact that they will eat any small 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.010
 fish that is very hard they do not 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.140
 will lie for hours such nozzles to wait 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.600
 approach your large carp 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.060
 most likely they will eat a trifle for it 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.160
 time boilies normal quality 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.160
 which there is a sufficient amount 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.790
 ingredients it remains attractive 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.250
 for fish 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.850
 somewhere for two days 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.410
 touches him working there to various 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.810
 external influences at the bottom of the reservoir 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.120
 he stays in such a solid state he 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.730
 a little swell of course in water but in 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.050
 so solid it remains well 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.500
 at least a week 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.690
 a week if you have water but also 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.670
 for two days 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.670
 retains its appeal to fish 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.750
 until it erodes the main ones 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.120
 Ingredients 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.460
 another effective method 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.160
 lure is use 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.850
 special soluble materials 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.030
 has a variety of packages that bags 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.830
 allow to deliver loose bait 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.410
 over fairly long distances and 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.790
 The advantage of this method is that 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.380
 bait will be in 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.040
 close proximity to your 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.040
 packs what presents itself in packages 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:16.260
 This bag is made of special material. 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.750
 in fact it is called maybe 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.340
 sex it is called erroneously in fact 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.720
 this field is vinyl alcohol that is 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.890
 special material which 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.410
 soluble in water 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.130
 the packages themselves are quite strong and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.850
 durable until they get wet and they 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.130
 allow 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.140
 in general, quite large loads to 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.250
 they apply when casting 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:42.630
 these casts but at the same time hitting the water 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.900
 such a package will dissolve according to 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.440
 from water temperature from 30 seconds there to 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.480
 one and a half minutes how to use such 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.090
 packages to make it more convenient 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.780
 fill a different bait 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.390
 used such a special funnel with 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.380
 notch and so or pack worn on 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:08.070
 this funnel after that into it 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.730
 placed leash sinker to not 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.430
 interfered we put here in this compartment 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.240
 especially for the sinker after that we 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.960
 starting to fill this funnel 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.960
 different dry pay attention dry 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.960
 bait 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.789
 prikormku in the package tamped 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:35.599
 the leash itself remains among 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:40.389
 bait after the package is full 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:42.919
 prikormkoy sinker falls from above already 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:49.659
 directly into the funnel and gets into 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:49.659
 the package through the slot we remove the funnel 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:57.259
 sinker with a leash with us 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:07:01.659
 end up inside the package after that 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:04.009
 package needed above quit to tie 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.930
 soluble fishing line and that's such a 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.810
 bait design along with 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.490
 a sinker with a leash with a nozzle she 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:14.439
 thrown after dissolving package 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:17.949
 it turns out that we have all the bait and 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:22.460
 nozzle it all lies in one place and 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:26.229
 review attract more fish than one 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.229
