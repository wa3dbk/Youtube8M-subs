hi I'm clay Olsen with the wicked edge
what<00:00:04.500> I've<00:00:04.589> gotten<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.859> sharpener<00:00:05.279> here<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.700> a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
what I've gotten the sharpener here is a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.350 
what I've gotten the sharpener here is a
beautiful<00:00:06.450> Strider<00:00:07.340> SMG<00:00:08.340> spearpoint<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
beautiful Strider SMG spearpoint and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.540 
beautiful Strider SMG spearpoint and
this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> rare<00:00:11.070> ones<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.460> was

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
this is one of the rare ones that was

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.200 
this is one of the rare ones that was
made<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.969> CPM<00:00:12.620> s110v<00:00:13.620> steel<00:00:14.400> which<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
made with CPM s110v steel which is a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.390 
made with CPM s110v steel which is a
it's<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.690> wonderful<00:00:15.839> steel<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.740> there's<00:00:17.250> not

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
it's a wonderful steel and there's not

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
it's a wonderful steel and there's not
too<00:00:17.640> many<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> these<00:00:17.970> knives<00:00:18.180> made<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
too many of these knives made and it's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.130 
too many of these knives made and it's
got<00:00:19.380> excellent<00:00:19.800> wear<00:00:20.070> resistance<00:00:20.810> very<00:00:21.810> very

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
got excellent wear resistance very very

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620 
got excellent wear resistance very very
evenly<00:00:22.890> distributed<00:00:23.430> carbide<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.210> takes<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
evenly distributed carbide so it takes a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
evenly distributed carbide so it takes a
super<00:00:24.810> refined<00:00:25.320> edge<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.400> been

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
super refined edge and it's been

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
super refined edge and it's been
hardened<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> sixty<00:00:27.599> Rockwell<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.289> it's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
hardened to sixty Rockwell so it's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
hardened to sixty Rockwell so it's
really<00:00:28.619> gonna<00:00:28.769> hold<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.160> edge<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
really gonna hold that edge and be a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.810 
really gonna hold that edge and be a
great<00:00:30.660> cutter<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.309> sent<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
great cutter and it was sent in by a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.330 
great cutter and it was sent in by a
customer<00:00:33.450> named<00:00:34.020> Jim<00:00:34.260> McCormack<00:00:34.800> who<00:00:35.130> had

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
customer named Jim McCormack who had

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
customer named Jim McCormack who had
picked<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.850> secondhand<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:37.469> having<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
picked it up secondhand and was having a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
picked it up secondhand and was having a
couple<00:00:38.040> issues<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:39.360> issue

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
couple issues with it the first issue

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.130 
couple issues with it the first issue
was<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.559> had<00:00:40.680> been<00:00:40.770> sharpened

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
was that it had been sharpened

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.330 
was that it had been sharpened
asymmetrically<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> bevels<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
asymmetrically and one of the bevels was

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
asymmetrically and one of the bevels was
much<00:00:44.550> bigger<00:00:44.730> than<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.090> other<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
much bigger than the other and the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
much bigger than the other and the
second<00:00:46.350> problem<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.370> unable<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
second problem was that he was unable to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
second problem was that he was unable to
get<00:00:47.879> rid<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> scratches<00:00:49.140> along<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
get rid of all the scratches along the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500 
get rid of all the scratches along the
bevel<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.399> he<00:00:50.489> sent<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> us<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bevel so he sent it to us to see if we

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
bevel so he sent it to us to see if we
could<00:00:51.809> correct<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.949> we've<00:00:53.070> done

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
could correct it and I think we've done

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
could correct it and I think we've done
a<00:00:53.219> pretty<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.910> job<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.379> getting<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
a pretty good job of getting all the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.170 
a pretty good job of getting all the
scratches<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.699> I've<00:00:59.699> managed<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
scratches out and I've managed to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.529 
scratches out and I've managed to
correct<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> bevel<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.460> really

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
correct the bevel so that it's really

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
correct the bevel so that it's really
got<00:01:03.539> great<00:01:03.719> symmetry<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.369> grind<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
got great symmetry now and the grind is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
got great symmetry now and the grind is
correct

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.510 

the<00:01:10.950> procedure<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.000> correct<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
the procedure I use to correct the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
the procedure I use to correct the
bevels<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> grind<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> center

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
bevels and get the grind down the center

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
bevels and get the grind down the center
of<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> blade<00:01:16.530> again<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> start<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.030> our

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
of the blade again was to start with our

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.050 
of the blade again was to start with our
50<00:01:18.930> grit<00:01:19.140> super<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.979> ultra<00:01:20.490> coarse<00:01:20.700> Diamond

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
50 grit super or ultra coarse Diamond

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
50 grit super or ultra coarse Diamond
stones<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.690> just<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.440> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> side<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
stones and just work on the side that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
stones and just work on the side that
was<00:01:23.250> small<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.149> I<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> knife<00:01:24.720> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
was small so when I got the knife that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
was small so when I got the knife that
first<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.920> bevel<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.280> gigantic<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.060> one

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
first one bevel is gigantic and one

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
first one bevel is gigantic and one
bevel<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:27.810> small

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
bevel is very small

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
bevel is very small
I<00:01:28.409> took<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.040> ultra<00:01:29.640> core<00:01:29.850> stones<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I took the ultra core stones and just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
I took the ultra core stones and just
worked<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> small<00:01:31.229> side<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.130> tell<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
worked on the small side and tell that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.480 
worked on the small side and tell that
until<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> edge<00:01:33.930> itself<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.740> knife<00:01:34.890> came

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
until the edge itself of the knife came

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
until the edge itself of the knife came
right<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> center<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> then<00:01:36.990> now

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
right back to the center and then now

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.029 
right back to the center and then now
both<00:01:38.159> bellows<00:01:38.549> were<00:01:38.759> were<00:01:39.180> nice<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
both bellows were were nice and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.620 
both bellows were were nice and
symmetrical<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.030> able<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.270> start<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
symmetrical and I was able to start the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.169 
symmetrical and I was able to start the
polishing<00:01:43.020> process<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:44.039> from<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:44.429> instead

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
polishing process and from there instead

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.760 
polishing process and from there instead
of<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.569> diamonds<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.229> decided<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> play

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
of going with diamonds I decided to play

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.169 
of going with diamonds I decided to play
around<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.190> bit<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.580> use<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> show

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
around a little bit and use the show

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.840 
around a little bit and use the show
Sarah<00:01:48.420> water<00:01:48.659> stones<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> main<00:01:50.310> reason<00:01:50.670> there

looking<00:02:49.019> terrific<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> process

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
looking terrific you know the process

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.300 
looking terrific you know the process
it's<00:02:51.450> really<00:02:51.720> easy<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.739> took<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.100> about

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's really easy to do it took me about

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.789 
it's really easy to do it took me about
15<00:02:53.790> minutes<00:02:54.120> from<00:02:54.209> start<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> finish<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.200> get

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
15 minutes from start to finish to get

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.370 
15 minutes from start to finish to get
to<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.070> level<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.660> results<00:02:58.079> I<00:02:58.170> think

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
to this level and the results I think

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.199 
to this level and the results I think
are<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.920> immensely<00:02:59.280> satisfying<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.120> I'm

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
are just immensely satisfying so I'm

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.910 
are just immensely satisfying so I'm
really<00:03:00.359> confident<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.049> when<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> send<00:03:01.739> this

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920
