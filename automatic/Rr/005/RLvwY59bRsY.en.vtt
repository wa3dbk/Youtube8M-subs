Hello, I've decided to do a series of videos
where I play some music and do a little bit

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.900
of talking beforehand to introduce the song,
and then hopefully get a little bit of feedback

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
from you guys! So, this first one I'm going
to play doesn't have a name, which is a really

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.990
bad start in terms of introducing songs, I
know. But I tend to name my pieces after I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.599
write them based on images I get given by
people who listen to them, so yeah any feedback

00:00:31.599 --> 00:03:24.069
in that respect would be hugely appreciated.
This is how it goes!
