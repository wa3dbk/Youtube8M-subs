Kieran side of it don't you think he'd

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
Kieran side of it don't you think he'd

be able to connect adults I don't know

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.750 
be able to connect adults I don't know
if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.039> able<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> write<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:53.730> as

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
if you would be able to write it off as

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
if you would be able to write it off as
records<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> silly<00:00:55.320> prank<00:00:55.559> if

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
records or just a silly prank if

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
records or just a silly prank if
everything<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> notebook<00:00:56.760> fits<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.180> well<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
everything the notebook fits so well in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
everything the notebook fits so well in
the<00:00:57.570> Kira<00:00:57.899> case<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.920> he<00:00:59.010> should<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the Kira case so I think he should have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.740 
the Kira case so I think he should have
taken<00:00:59.399> better<00:00:59.579> measures<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> hide<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
taken better measures to hide it to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
taken better measures to hide it to
begin<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.250> he

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
begin with so now we get to how he

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
begin with so now we get to how he
actually<00:01:02.579> hides<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.329> notebook<00:01:03.690> he<00:01:04.140> raised

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually hides the notebook he raised

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually hides the notebook he raised
his<00:01:04.830> desk<00:01:05.129> drawer<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:06.090> gasoline<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
his desk drawer with gasoline now this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.630 
his desk drawer with gasoline now this
is<00:01:07.200> pretty<00:01:07.470> interesting<00:01:07.740> his<00:01:08.159> drawer<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
is pretty interesting his drawer has a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
is pretty interesting his drawer has a
false<00:01:08.970> bottom<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> open<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> pen

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
false bottom if you open it with a pen

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
false bottom if you open it with a pen
from<00:01:10.590> underneath<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.580> everything<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> good

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
from underneath it everything is good

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
from underneath it everything is good
but<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> try<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> force<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.250> false<00:01:14.490> bottom

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
but if you try to force the false bottom

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
but if you try to force the false bottom
off<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> drawer<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.320> ignite<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> burn

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
off then the drawer will ignite and burn

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
off then the drawer will ignite and burn
all<00:01:17.189> evidence<00:01:17.640> while<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> true<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.540> would

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
all evidence while it is true that would

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
all evidence while it is true that would
burn<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.200> Death<00:01:19.380> Note<00:01:19.409> thus<00:01:19.830> burning<00:01:20.220> the

note just catches on fire and lights
desk<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.850> what<00:01:59.969> happens

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
desk and then we get to see what happens

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
desk and then we get to see what happens
from<00:02:00.390> there<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.320> he<00:02:01.680> took<00:02:01.829> some

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
from there because I think he took some

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
from there because I think he took some
pretty<00:02:02.369> ridiculous<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> unnecessary

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
pretty ridiculous and unnecessary

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
pretty ridiculous and unnecessary
measures<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> hide<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> death<00:02:05.040> note<00:02:05.310> but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
measures to hide the death note but

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
measures to hide the death note but
again<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.390> evidence<00:02:06.659> would<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.020> gone<00:02:07.530> so

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
again all the evidence would be gone so

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
again all the evidence would be gone so
why<00:02:08.129> would<00:02:08.340> probably<00:02:08.759> end<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.030> free<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> charge

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
why would probably end up free of charge

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.300 
why would probably end up free of charge
one<00:02:10.110> more<00:02:10.259> thing<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:10.830> pretty<00:02:11.009> funny

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
death itself and that whole scene was

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.770 
death itself and that whole scene was

to<00:02:51.410> get<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> life<00:02:51.860> much<00:02:52.160> more<00:02:52.370> quickly<00:02:52.640> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
to get to life much more quickly it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.520

feels like he'd gone away without a bit
too<00:02:54.710> easily<00:02:54.890> especially<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.640> eiza<00:02:56.030> while

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
too easily especially with eiza while

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.060 
too easily especially with eiza while
walking<00:02:56.420> right<00:02:56.840> past<00:02:56.870> them<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.740> he<00:02:57.830> had<00:02:57.950> an

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
walking right past them but he had an

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.440 
walking right past them but he had an
umbrella<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:58.760> he<00:02:58.850> didn't<00:02:59.180> he<00:02:59.240> would<00:02:59.360> have

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
umbrella and if he didn't he would have

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.510

I<00:03:03.680> think<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.100> could<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.310> been<00:03:04.400> used<00:03:04.580> to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.730 
I think that could have been used to
make<00:03:04.880> light<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> bigger<00:03:05.420> suspect<00:03:06.050> early<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.530> i

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
make light a bigger suspect early on i
