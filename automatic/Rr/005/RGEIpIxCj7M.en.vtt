00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
on what places do but I couldn't really

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
on what places do but I couldn't really
find<00:00:37.890> any<00:00:38.360> admittedly<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.450> didn't<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:40.140> look

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
find any admittedly I didn't really look

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
find any admittedly I didn't really look
too<00:00:40.590> hard<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.970> flipping<00:00:42.120> through

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
too hard but I was just flipping through

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.910 
too hard but I was just flipping through
the<00:00:42.510> character<00:00:42.870> roster<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.530> thought

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the character roster and then I thought

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
the character roster and then I thought
of<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> may<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.210> completely

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of one so this may not be completely

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
of one so this may not be completely
accurate<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.339> off<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.519> my<00:00:47.730> vague

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
accurate I'm going off of my vague

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.710 
accurate I'm going off of my vague
memory<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.290> Buu<00:00:49.470> saga<00:00:49.769> but<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> fight

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
memory of the Buu saga but and the fight

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.360 
memory of the Buu saga but and the fight
that<00:00:51.900> I<00:00:51.930> thought<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:53.300> demon<00:00:54.300> king<00:00:54.510> Tabora

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
that I thought of was demon king Tabora

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.850 
that I thought of was demon king Tabora
versus<00:00:56.370> majin<00:00:57.120> buu<00:00:57.269> because<00:00:57.659> in<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.260> Buu<00:00:58.589> saga

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
versus majin buu because in the Buu saga

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.299 
versus majin buu because in the Buu saga
I<00:00:59.129> believed<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.780> said<00:01:01.080> that<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.320> demon<00:01:02.159> king

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

Devorah was like the strongest guy ever
in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.620> demon<00:01:04.979> world<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.370> we<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in the demon world and we all know that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
in the demon world and we all know that
it's<00:01:06.299> possible<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.530> break<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> magic

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
