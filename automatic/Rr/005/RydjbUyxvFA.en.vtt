00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.930
 We are famous worldwide in Mexico 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.690
 our taco because it's a very 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.030
 easy to move the food in fact 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.160
 So the taco was invented when you love them 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.720
 from home they go to the things of men 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.470

 you were a husband's lunch 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.860

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.590
 beans meat and took the husband to 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.450

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.250
 was born the taco is a story that does not 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.420

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.080
 it really is very practical and it is now very 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.870

 Alierta is time for good onion 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.699
 icio or no tacos without onion is not with 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.830
 every time you what do you think when I 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:34.180
 I do not put the only thing like lemon 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.190
 for example if I put it on seafood 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.410
 and that but I feel that it robs you a lot 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.509
 essential flavor of the taco 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.280

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:51.430
