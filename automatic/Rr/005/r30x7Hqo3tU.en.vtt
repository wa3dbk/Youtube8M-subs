but if football teams you know it's it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
but if football teams you know it's it's
not<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> great<00:01:14.369> deal<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.880> yeah

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
not a great deal and yeah

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
not a great deal and yeah
the<00:01:15.720> difference<00:01:16.170> between<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.650> 12<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the difference between like 12 and a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.499 
the difference between like 12 and a
half<00:01:17.130> million<00:01:17.460> pounds<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.880> fifteen<00:01:18.299> million

half million pounds of fifteen million
pounds<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.590> difference<00:01:19.890> between<00:01:20.009> me

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
pounds and the difference between me

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
pounds and the difference between me
thinking<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.570> piece<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
thinking this is a good piece of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
thinking this is a good piece of
business<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> we'll<00:01:22.680> probably<00:01:23.090> edges<00:01:24.090> who

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
business and we'll probably edges who

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
business and we'll probably edges who
was<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.720> being<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.140> big<00:01:25.350> piece<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> business

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
was it not being a big piece of business

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
was it not being a big piece of business
