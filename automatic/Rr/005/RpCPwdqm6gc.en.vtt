00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 ain 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 there 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.419
 in the tribute to the flag 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.419
 the german airline air 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.430
 the winner 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.430
 win win win and win 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.240
 as they say their songs 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.100
 they arrived at the stadium john n lÃ³pez drunkards or marijuana because they arrived 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.400
 offending all this pretty prison that had gathered to see the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 team of his loves to the reboceros of piety 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.400
 this hobby that those who want to see football and who wants their team to be 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.750
 Mexican soccer star because he has a hobby 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410
 that will support us in good times and bad 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 but you lion friends have made it clear to us that they are animals 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.890
 and cowards for throwing objects inside the stadium endangering 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.370
 the lives of the people who had gathered for this meeting 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 this fact 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.390
 It was what caused people to turn on top of you 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.770
 attacking them 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.340
 just as you had done 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.740
 friends of Leon today it was more than clear that violence generates more 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.120
 violence and that they are a clear example of what is not very well 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.950
 where do you live 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 in a football stadium because football expressed 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 football 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 and nothing else you endanger the lives of others and yours 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.270
 same 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.770
 in terms of use but we will continue to support the team of piety because 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.200
 we wanted the team to be the protagonist 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.729
 we have to do that as soon as possible because this hobby deserves 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.340
 a national first division team because this hobby also wants that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.599
 this stadium is 100% familiar on how many trains lion friends 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.000
 I wish you the best of luck but one thing I can assure you 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.509
 you never return to the maximum circuit because you 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.539
 min god 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.839
