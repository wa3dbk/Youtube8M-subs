00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.619
 namely macro by 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.250
 this is a universal application macro 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 character and in fact I called povadino 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:04.729
 one button and it was created by me after 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.670
 long thinking, I realized that by 1 all 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.530
 constantly doing the same thing 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.789
 the same thing constantly alternates everything 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.740
 Laden is very comfortable staff for 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:24.009
 macro and now we will see why and how 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.009

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.000
 a light warrior's strike to tried twice from 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.760
 as if all right and attack 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.930
 chelama and this macro is useful 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.930
 I'll post it too in the description 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 justice comes next 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 anger of heaven namely this combination anger 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.060

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.420

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.329
 right now I ’ll do it in front of you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.620
 principle of decay we remove that you 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.120
 retribution does not spoil your macro 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.659
 accordingly, I’m already ready for you 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.659
 macro and now 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:19.850
 where I already have Murshid say 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.850
 This warrior's revenge is copying 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.150
 and I'll tell you what exactly does 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:36.870
 payback when you use it payback 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:40.020
 ogre club in fact you rarely 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.000
 come in handy and if you need someone 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.770
 warm you press shift and bend 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.770
 before your eyes i correct macros and 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.770
 correct for you just for you and 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:02.640
 herself once again but would skill down over yet 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.209
 go down that I was new ant 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.209
 So 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:21.479
 but well, all I found to maintain the principle 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:30.240
 print print used print true 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:38.270
 the seal is true the most powerful for a warrior 1 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:42.900
 from the tank and so lipstick rouge 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.410
 big tue payback pinch spike you 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.410
 it turns out 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:05:06.199
 the name of the color as you wish 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.199
 principle that's how it should be called 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.490
 lighting 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:17.270

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.270

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.940

 the wrath of heaven ie it all works 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.340
 I checked 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:53.220
