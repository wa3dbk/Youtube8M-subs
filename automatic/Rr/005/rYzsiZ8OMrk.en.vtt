00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.260
 for this part of strawberry we are going to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.009
 need two packages of cream cheese 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.080
 a can of condensed milk a third 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.420
 of a cup of lemon juice two 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 teaspoons of vanilla essence and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.859
 Washed and disinfected strawberries a cup 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 of sugar 2 tablespoons of water and strawberries 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 in slices to decorate we go here to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.800
 put the strawberries together with the sugar on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
 water here nothing more in a pot 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 strawberries sugar and water two 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.489
 tablespoons of water no more nothing else is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 little bit and the strawberries that look pretty 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.380
 humidity so they go themselves 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 taking out his own juice and leave 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.910
 doing like a honey ecita so is that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's leave it here it done 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 the candy along with the sugar and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 strawberries are going to have a little bit of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.600
 patience does not take long is matter 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.770
 of about five or ten minutes what is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.200
 does is have melanie is rich 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.720
 strawberries which is the one we're going to use 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.610
 for this part on the other hand here in the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.010
 blender let's put the cream cheese 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.620
 can be made with cream cheese or look 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.450
 also how it can be done with ice cream 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.420
 with vanilla ice cream is great 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.460
 that about here the blender we're going to 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.200
 start to beat with vanilla ice cream 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 it is also very rich if suddenly 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.220
 we say we do not have time or I already have 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.190
 the best as a low low diet in 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.440
 sugars and I do not want to consume milk 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.610
 condensed in this example or sugar what 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 what they can do is do 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.740
 you need with sugar substitute with the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.410
 water the strawberries that are made to me 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.000
 also chosen here in the pot and for 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.220
 another side can use it with ice cream 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.830
 of vanilla low in sugar that also 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.030
 this mixture is great but good 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.860
 this is how we are doing here in 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 they are art because it is left to lips and we have 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.130
 the cream cheese that is already cream we are going to 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.310
 add now 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.750
 condensed milk and bad coordinate 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.939
 the fact against me makes me water 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.619
 let's add milk here 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.159
 condensed can also be by 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.740
 example with cream and with icing sugar is 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.940
 mix let's now add lemon 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.140
 lemon juice and vanilla 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.750
 we wait for the cream that is 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.570
 Integrate everything completely to the one that will be 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.220
 as well as a pasta etc and creamy 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.990
 let's open speed MOTHERS 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
 it can also be the blender if not 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.960
 they have a blender they can sit on the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.790
 blender though to me the blender 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.160
 like it a little more because there is a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.180
 little thicker is not so tan 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.970
 watered down like 'he like the blender like that is 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.950
 that is almost ours 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.390
 Strawberry jam has given them all 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.310
 a few minutes because I think that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.900
 I softened a little bit more the strawberry I want 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.820
 to see her here is still very whole 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 but see how the juice is already letting go 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.550
 and how it will not painting candy 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.190
 I want the strawberry to be well now 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.180
 soft then I'm going to leave you some 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.750
 how many more minutes in the fire so that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.580
 make a little more candy and for 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.640
 Strawberry course a little softened 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.990
 more we are already then here already with 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.060
 our prey that is missing some 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.150
 how many more minutes I have here already 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.670
 a mixture that is already cold and good 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.510
 is ready to prepare your part 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.520
 also see how it went well 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.840
 our cream cheese and was already text 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.880
 integrated everything perfectly then 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.460
 let's start just to form it 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.780
 Well, it's very simple, we're going to 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.940
 start to put a little bit of this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130
 mix of strawberries if you want what can 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 crush a bit or if you want they can 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.870
 put it as it is so straight 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.090
 to taste so I'll put it live 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.760
 so that they feel a little bit the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.840
 consistency of the strawberries now we go to 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.569
 put some of this cream mixture already 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.109
 We have already prepared here above 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.670
 for another bit that you see here in the 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.670
 part of medium 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.400
 Let us now put 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.159
 nothing else what so rich thing is going 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.140
 mixing a little bit let's put another 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.140
 little strawberries on top 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.590
 with his juice his candy and how they 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.950
 I said you can for example 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.470
 well then make the pass with 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.630
 any other type of fruit can 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.880
 be it was also because pro peach or 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.460
 mango if they like it and do not like 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.630
 berries can use for example another 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.270
 type of fruit that also remains 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.940
 wonderful and they can do it to your liking 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.150
 the important thing is to integrate many times 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.100
 the fruit in things that we do not know 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.740
 many times how to do it like giving them 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.560
 fruits in the at breakfast or to the eye in 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.660
 the food and it's very important that 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.320
 let's integrate, of course, the food 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.750
 daily fruits and vegetables so it's not 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.580
 I will forget them I am ready 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.800
 with my part, the only thing I need is 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.050
 take it to the refrigerator put a layer 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.010
 more of cream so that we finish with the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.600
 cream and what do you think if we leave 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.170
 straight to the presentation table and 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.170
 companions 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.950
 step by step strawberry part for the 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.960
 Milk base whisks cheese to cream 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.100
 Add condensed milk integra adds 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.020
 the lemon juice and the essence of 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.490
 Vanilla reserves the strawberry filling 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.020
 place the strawberries in the pot 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.880
 sugar and water cooks at low heat 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.680
 until you get a kind of jam 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.330
 let cool to ride in a cup 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.590
 place a layer of milk a layer of 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.690
 strawberry and continues alternating until 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.520
 refill the glass refrigerates during a 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.230
 hour or until it is firm offers 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.230
