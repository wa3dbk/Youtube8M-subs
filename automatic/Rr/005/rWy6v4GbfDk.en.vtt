hi there this unfortunately is not my
usual<00:00:21.090> tutorial<00:00:22.090> because<00:00:22.779> I've<00:00:22.960> had<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.140> bit<00:00:23.290> of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
usual tutorial because I've had a bit of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.450 
usual tutorial because I've had a bit of
a<00:00:23.470> run-in<00:00:23.740> with<00:00:23.890> technology<00:00:24.730> I<00:00:24.880> did<00:00:25.300> tape<00:00:25.540> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
a run-in with technology I did tape the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.290 
a run-in with technology I did tape the
process<00:00:27.460> of<00:00:27.580> putting<00:00:27.760> this<00:00:27.970> mixed-media

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
process of putting this mixed-media

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.319 
process of putting this mixed-media
canvas<00:00:28.960> together<00:00:29.259> but<00:00:29.919> and<00:00:30.250> when<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:31.029> came<00:00:31.150> to

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
canvas together but and when I came to

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.460 
canvas together but and when I came to
upload<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.750> there<00:00:31.869> was<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:32.050> problem<00:00:32.320> with

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
upload it there was a problem with

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.250 
upload it there was a problem with
iMovie<00:00:33.310> and<00:00:33.490> then<00:00:33.970> in<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.180> process<00:00:34.630> of<00:00:34.780> trying

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
iMovie and then in the process of trying

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.160 
iMovie and then in the process of trying
to<00:00:35.410> sort<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.340> out<00:00:36.400> I<00:00:36.700> am<00:00:37.090> lost<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.750> whole<00:00:37.900> lot

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
to sort that out I am lost the whole lot

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.380 
to sort that out I am lost the whole lot
which<00:00:38.680> was<00:00:38.829> quite<00:00:39.010> upsetting<00:00:39.820> at<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.180> time

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
which was quite upsetting at the time

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.080 
which was quite upsetting at the time
but<00:00:40.630> um<00:00:41.430> there's<00:00:42.430> nothing<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.790> could<00:00:42.850> do<00:00:43.060> about

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
but um there's nothing I could do about

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.420 
but um there's nothing I could do about
it<00:00:43.300> just<00:00:43.570> had<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.780> let<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.110> go<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.500> instead

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
it just had to let it go and instead

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.610 
it just had to let it go and instead
because<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.120> lot<00:00:46.630> of<00:00:46.660> my<00:00:46.870> youtube<00:00:47.290> viewers

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
because a lot of my youtube viewers

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.950 
because a lot of my youtube viewers
perhaps<00:00:48.220> don't<00:00:48.400> visit<00:00:48.640> me<00:00:48.880> over<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.330> my<00:00:49.450> blog<00:00:49.630> I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
perhaps don't visit me over on my blog I

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.930 
perhaps don't visit me over on my blog I
just<00:00:50.350> wanted<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.710> share<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.130> with<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.640> too

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
just wanted to share this with you too

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.880 
just wanted to share this with you too
because<00:00:52.570> I've<00:00:53.020> already<00:00:53.200> shared<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.650> over<00:00:53.770> my

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
because I've already shared it over my

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.350 
because I've already shared it over my
blog<00:00:54.100> because<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.760> took<00:00:54.820> part<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.300> the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
blog because I took part in the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.650 
blog because I took part in the
challenge<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:56.340> dr.<00:00:57.340> sort<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.030> gave<00:00:58.480> me<00:00:58.630> the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
challenge and dr. sort of gave me the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.990 
challenge and dr. sort of gave me the
idea<00:00:58.870> for<00:00:59.200> this<00:00:59.440> canvas<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.550> want<00:01:00.700> to<00:01:00.790> share

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
idea for this canvas and I want to share

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.890 
idea for this canvas and I want to share
it<00:01:01.060> with<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.720> this<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:03.040> can<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
it with you and this as you can see is a

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.230 
it with you and this as you can see is a
spring<00:01:04.900> is<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.590> air<00:01:05.680> canvas<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.939> idea

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
spring is in the air canvas and the idea

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.050 
spring is in the air canvas and the idea
behind<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.689> was<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:08.080> take<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.189> from<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.580> tree<00:01:09.850> in

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
behind it was to take you from a tree in

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.760 
behind it was to take you from a tree in
the<00:01:10.509> winter<00:01:10.900> which<00:01:11.049> is<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> black<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.590> white

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the winter which is the black and white

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.219 
the winter which is the black and white
portion<00:01:12.159> of<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.400> canvas<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.720> spring

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
portion of the canvas to the spring

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
portion of the canvas to the spring
which<00:01:14.470> obviously<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:15.100> where<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.790> color<00:01:16.030> is

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
which obviously is where the color is

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.540 
which obviously is where the color is
added<00:01:16.510> into<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> design<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:17.920> there<00:01:18.430> are<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
added into the design and there are a

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.750 
added into the design and there are a
lot<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.880> details<00:01:19.720> in<00:01:20.110> this<00:01:20.650> canvas<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:21.640> I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
lot of details in this canvas and I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.300 
lot of details in this canvas and I
started<00:01:22.150> out<00:01:22.330> by<00:01:22.510> painting<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.590> background

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
started out by painting the background

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.070 
started out by painting the background
and<00:01:24.580> again<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:24.850> was<00:01:25.060> bearing<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.510> mind<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:25.840> I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
and again I was bearing in mind that I

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320 
and again I was bearing in mind that I
was<00:01:26.620> keeping<00:01:26.920> one<00:01:27.220> side<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.670> canvas<00:01:27.909> black

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
was keeping one side of the canvas black

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.410 
was keeping one side of the canvas black
and<00:01:28.510> white<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.870> one<00:01:29.710> side<00:01:30.070> was<00:01:30.790> going<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.270> be

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and white and one side was going to be

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.800 
and white and one side was going to be
in<00:01:31.720> color<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.820> those<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.479> seen

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
in color so those of you that have seen

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.480 
in color so those of you that have seen
some<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.170> my<00:01:35.320> designs<00:01:35.710> before<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.159> know<00:01:36.310> that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
some of my designs before you know that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.300 
some of my designs before you know that
I<00:01:36.520> do<00:01:36.670> like<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.000> use<00:01:37.750> printed<00:01:38.320> but<00:01:38.500> pages<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.190> my

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
I do like to use printed but pages in my

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.780 
I do like to use printed but pages in my
designs<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.940> this<00:01:40.900> one<00:01:41.110> had<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.040> be<00:01:42.070> stamped

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
designs and this one had to be stamped

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.670 
designs and this one had to be stamped
because<00:01:43.060> i<00:01:43.180> needed<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.510> 12<00:01:43.780> x<00:01:43.930> 12<00:01:44.200> image<00:01:44.530> in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
because i needed a 12 x 12 image in

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.370 
because i needed a 12 x 12 image in
order<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.010> cut<00:01:45.190> out<00:01:45.370> my<00:01:45.549> tree<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.450> i<00:01:46.479> stamped<00:01:47.290> it

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
order to cut out my tree so i stamped it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.010 
order to cut out my tree so i stamped it
using<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.799> print<00:01:48.040> stamp<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.580> had<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.030> then

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
using a print stamp that I had and then

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.469 
using a print stamp that I had and then
I<00:01:50.080> cut<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.470> out<00:01:50.620> into<00:01:50.950> my<00:01:51.159> tree<00:01:51.400> shape<00:01:51.700> which<00:01:52.299> I

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
I cut it out into my tree shape which I

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.719 
I cut it out into my tree shape which I
then<00:01:52.659> then<00:01:53.229> tangled<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.920> design<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.340> so

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
then then tangled a design on so

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.910 
then then tangled a design on so
wrapping<00:01:55.150> mine<00:01:55.360> zentangle<00:01:56.020> around<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> trunk

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
wrapping mine zentangle around the trunk

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.219 
wrapping mine zentangle around the trunk
and<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.159> branches<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.850> my<00:01:58.570> trees<00:01:58.960> and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
and the branches of my trees and

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.490 
and the branches of my trees and
obviously<00:02:00.070> this<00:02:00.250> tree<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.790> mostly<00:02:01.240> still<00:02:02.229> in

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
obviously this tree is mostly still in

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.170 
obviously this tree is mostly still in
winter<00:02:02.950> mode<00:02:03.130> hence<00:02:03.490> all<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.729> black<00:02:04.000> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
bringing spring to the trees and she did

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.289 
bringing spring to the trees and she did
take<00:03:13.379> me<00:03:13.409> a<00:03:13.560> little<00:03:13.709> while<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:14.639> sketch<00:03:14.879> out<00:03:15.090> I'm

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
take me a little while to sketch out I'm

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.819 
take me a little while to sketch out I'm
not<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> world's<00:03:15.659> best<00:03:15.840> person<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.590> drawing

figures and I get there in the end but
it<00:03:19.349> definitely<00:03:19.530> took<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.859> few<00:03:20.069> few<00:03:20.609> attempts

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329
