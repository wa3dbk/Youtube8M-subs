00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hello today we're gonna have a look at

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello today we're gonna have a look at
how<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> disable<00:00:04.020> super<00:00:04.950> fetch<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.460> free

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
how to disable super fetch and free

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.030 
how to disable super fetch and free
fetch<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.990> Windows<00:00:07.529> 10<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.960> 8.1<00:00:10.040> okay

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
fetch in Windows 10 and 8.1 okay

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.870 
fetch in Windows 10 and 8.1 okay
basically<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.530> service<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.880> shall

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
basically this is a service that shall

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.870 
basically this is a service that shall
we<00:00:15.030> say<00:00:15.269> loads<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.929> files<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.830> advance<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.699> us

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
we say loads up files in advance of us

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.630 
we say loads up files in advance of us
actually<00:00:18.119> accessing<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.010> basically<00:00:20.369> if

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
actually accessing them so basically if

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.279 
actually accessing them so basically if
we<00:00:20.670> were<00:00:20.910> gonna<00:00:21.060> unload<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> program<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
we were gonna unload up a program in a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
we were gonna unload up a program in a
few<00:00:22.500> seconds<00:00:22.920> based<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.519> our<00:00:23.670> history<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> our

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
few seconds based on our history and our

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.480 
few seconds based on our history and our
behavior<00:00:25.260> patterns<00:00:25.880> windows<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> like

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
behavior patterns windows kind of like

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.959 
behavior patterns windows kind of like
stores<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.119> data<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.529> program<00:00:32.009> etc<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
stores the data for that program etc in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
stores the data for that program etc in
advance<00:00:33.840> okay

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
advance okay

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.479 
advance okay
however<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.360> does<00:00:36.780> increase<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> read<00:00:38.100> times

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
however it does increase the read times

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.240 
however it does increase the read times
and<00:00:39.000> read<00:00:39.180> access<00:00:39.570> write<00:00:39.840> access<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.980> for

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and read access write access to this for

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.889 
and read access write access to this for
example<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> solid-state<00:00:42.600> disk

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
example if you have a solid-state disk

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
example if you have a solid-state disk
okay<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.100> extra<00:00:44.550> reads<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> writes<00:00:45.300> -<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
okay the extra reads and writes - it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.729 
okay the extra reads and writes - it
actually<00:00:45.930> wears<00:00:46.469> down<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.460> lifespan<00:00:48.739> falls

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually wears down your lifespan falls

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.520 
actually wears down your lifespan falls
in<00:00:50.250> certain<00:00:50.730> cases<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:51.960> slow

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
in certain cases it could actually slow

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
in certain cases it could actually slow
your<00:00:53.039> computer<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.370> however<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.930> quite

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your computer down however it is quite

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
your computer down however it is quite
an<00:00:55.289> efficient<00:00:55.739> system<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> does<00:00:56.699> actually

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
an efficient system and it does actually

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.869 
an efficient system and it does actually
work<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.620> certain<00:00:58.890> instances<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
work but in certain instances we need to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
work but in certain instances we need to
disable<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.710> need<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> go

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
disable it how do we do it we need to go

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
disable it how do we do it we need to go
to<00:01:02.070> services<00:01:02.640> how<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.239> there

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
to services how do we get there

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
to services how do we get there
basically<00:01:04.049> quite<00:01:04.439> simple<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> Windows<00:01:05.519> 10

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
basically quite simple in Windows 10

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically quite simple in Windows 10
over<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.510> type<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> services<00:01:07.970> dot

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
over here you just type in services dot

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.289 
over here you just type in services dot
MSC<00:01:09.689> okay<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.100> comes<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> service<00:01:11.939> over

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
MSC okay it comes up with a service over

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
MSC okay it comes up with a service over
here<00:01:12.450> sometimes<00:01:12.960> before<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> MSE<00:01:14.430> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here sometimes before the MSE it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.840 
here sometimes before the MSE it
automatically<00:01:14.939> shows<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:16.670> over<00:01:17.670> there

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
automatically shows up like over there

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.280 
automatically shows up like over there
okay<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:20.150> there<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.420> give<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> permission

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
okay and there we go give it permission

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
okay and there we go give it permission
and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.759> brings<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.150> our<00:01:24.270> window<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.990> had

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and it brings up our window that we had

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.700 
and it brings up our window that we had
before<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:26.759> scroll<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.229> find

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
before and we scroll down and we find

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.420 
before and we scroll down and we find
our<00:01:28.979> super<00:01:29.430> fetch<00:01:30.259> ok<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
our super fetch ok what we would want to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
our super fetch ok what we would want to
do<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:33.110> basically<00:01:35.090> disable<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:37.159> stop<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
do is basically disable it okay stop it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.740 
do is basically disable it okay stop it
from<00:01:38.430> running<00:01:38.759> currently<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:41.009> ok<00:01:41.750> once

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
from running currently and ok once

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
from running currently and ok once
that's<00:01:43.110> done<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.740> also<00:01:43.920> need<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's done we also need to go into the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.560 
that's done we also need to go into the
registry<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.579> set<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.360> take

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
registry and set it up there so we take

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.880 
registry and set it up there so we take
them<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> reg<00:01:48.990> edit<00:01:50.930> ok<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.380> found<00:01:52.680> our

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
them a reg edit ok will found our

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.480 
them a reg edit ok will found our
regedit<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.770> now<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.829> need<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.079> whoops

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490
