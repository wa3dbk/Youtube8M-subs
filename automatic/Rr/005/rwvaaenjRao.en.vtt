00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040
 then 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 Well 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.679
 good guys to all I'm rich 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.660
 for the last fifa italia team and I'm here 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.849
 today with stephan's player review 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.439
 lichtsteiner the right back of the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.920
 juventus that has earned this 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:36.460
 paper thanks to the goal and the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.129
 double assisi we say so supplied 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.510
 in the match against the parma in 7 to 0 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.190
 against the parma 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.690
 then let's go immediately to talk about 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.850
 this player 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.110
 I loved it he passes by 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.170
 77 of or 79 and I must say that the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.710
 improved features are heard 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.559
 because he said let's talk right away 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.110
 of the pros and you already see the new graphics 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.759
 I have included in the video I hope you 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.320
 like them maybe you have an overview 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.530
 more complete 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.829
 then let's go immediately for pros and cons 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.040
 of this player without a doubt the pro 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.799
 bigger we say so and speed 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.560
 that is, how can I not mention the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.530
 speed talking about vc tyner him 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.780
 practically you can do right and 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 left with ball control and not 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.790
 never stop and he will go very fast 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.900
 on the band really a player 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.840
 resounding 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.520
 from this point of view as he values 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.850
 has a nice 84 of acceleration 86 of 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.610
 top speed and I have to say this 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.930
 it then helps him to a 78 of agility 1 76 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.150
 balancing that maybe in game 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.860
 also seemed something more 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.390
 they looked like something more though I have to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.450
 I said I liked them a lot 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 then talking about the defensive phase he is 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 he really has a beautiful monster 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.729
 86 aggression is a 84 of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.979
 interception that are values 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.870
 resounding for a right-back like 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.350
 he 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.910
 guys for me I maybe now you 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.100
 you can say but no but you are saying 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.930
 something too big 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.870
 I am not afraid to say that for me it is the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.200
 right-back of series to stronger 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.920
 at the moment because maybe you can say 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.540
 there is no abbot I don't know there is with coma he is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.280
 really devastating I tried this 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.460
 if version surprised me why 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.500
 it really has amazing features but 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.780
 we are also going to talk about others 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.370
 features to a 79 control 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.490
 ball a 76 of physical strength that is me 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.560
 loved it and then to the steps 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.780
 that are really cool guys 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 long or short are beautiful 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.390
 especially the long ones as you will see in the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 clip makes really beautiful launches 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.580
 even the field changes are perfect has me 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.260
 amazed because I expected it 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.230
 something less in long passages but 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.090
 I really liked it then at 1 84 of 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.590
 slips that are spectacular, oh well 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.690
 that the slips are a bit subjective 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.980
 but they are really beautiful then I have it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.900
 used 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.360
 obviously in a defense of four though 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.830
 it could also make the right wing ie 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.300
 the outside right because it really has 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.180
 spectacular features 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.120
 I did n't put the shot into it though 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.390
 let's say it's not really the maximum second 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 me because oh well I made two three goals 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.489
 as you have seen, however, skipping a bogey 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.110
 playing more than anything else on him and 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.030
 trying to get the throat at all costs 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.310
 but I used it anyway 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 full time now in the sense I did not go 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.640
 to make me raids or going 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.220
 centrally 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.040
 I played normally using it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.110
 right in the defensive phase and I have to say 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.970
 I absolutely loved this one 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.240
 of the players that I liked the most 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.330
 absolute 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.420
 in this case then we say let's go to 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.599
 speak a little 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.580
 of the stars he has as a weak foot and 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.890
 how he moves then he and fancy e 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.160
 play right so for a full-back it goes 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.810
 more than fine and then three-star foot 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.100
 weak and 2-star possibility and the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.169
 dribbling as I told you I wanted 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.079
 to the right and left it is not that you can 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.930
 demand more from a defender 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.540
 I must say I can go the wall is chris 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.180
 high up I have to say that I liked it 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.130
 he was always in position up and down 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.600
 on the band to really have a work 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.050
 good for him good guys what to say 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.360
 this player 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.910
 I liked it I repeat it a lot for 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.200
 me about 33 thousand credits you can 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.660
 spend it 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.669
 you make yourself a top back especially for 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.040
 your series to why the priests give it 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.110
 in Swiss teams I don't think so 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.120
 guys the review ends here i hope 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.490
