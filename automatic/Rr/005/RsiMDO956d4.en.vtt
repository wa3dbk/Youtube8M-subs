00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Make changes to your car 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.150
 The car was chosen for forgetting because it has a basic and basic specifications 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.000
 It does not have an electronics, it has a hand-held window and can accommodate 4.2 diesel at a high power rate 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.080
 For its engine, which works to heat the components of the vehicle safely at 50 degrees below zero 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.150
 Keeping the engine running temperature will be a big challenge. 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.100
 So we chose to use the Hepsto heater, a diesel heater independently 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.230
 Paul Marsh - Mechanic sports cars 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.230
 The engine provides additional heat through the cooling system. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.030
 The ceiling lining and side glass were removed and we placed a insulating material on the entire car. 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.230
 The entire floor set has been removed to replace it with 30mm metal foil to be insulation 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.050
 enough. To ensure the safety of the vehicle is equipped with a special protection cage so that we can 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 Improved suspension, stronger leaks and improved shock absorbers Finally, the most important is their cohesion on the road 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.160
 And the setting of special snow frames is the only way to achieve this. 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.150
 We put a buffer material for the battery with a gel battery where the fuel system includes a heater to fuel the fuel 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.110
 If we leave the engine running all night and the alarm system will work if the engine stops 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.030
 We can hear the alarm sound. 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 Any hottest graduated to the top of the engine is lost so we put the insulation material with this fish to be 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.030
 A good cover for the engine also covers yourself tightly to prevent the heat from simply dropping out and effectiveness 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 In Yakutsk we had to put extra glass in the windows and the staff did so nicely 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 Where they used a glass front and isolation to leave an air gap on the glass. I did not see like 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 This wonderful work by. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 I think it's a great SUV with good tires running anywhere. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 Mika Salou - Champion of the Formula 1 race 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 good job. It works really well.
