going to go in and out in and out of the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.720 
going to go in and out in and out of the
dreadlock<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> needle<00:01:10.340> goes<00:01:10.520> almost

can just even stab it up and down as a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.510 
can just even stab it up and down as a
sewing<00:01:29.120> needle<00:01:29.270> would<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.890> help<00:01:31.130> get<00:01:31.340> those

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
sewing needle would to help get those

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.160 
sewing needle would to help get those
loose<00:01:31.760> hairs<00:01:32.000> back<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:32.690> it'll<00:01:32.780> just<00:01:32.960> not

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
loose hairs back in and it'll just not

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.980 
loose hairs back in and it'll just not
them<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:37.210> continue<00:01:38.210> doing<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.540> process

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
them up and continue doing the process

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.080 
them up and continue doing the process
like<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.680> little<00:01:40.370> bit<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.550> twisting

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
like that a little bit of twisting

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.940 
like that a little bit of twisting
should<00:01:42.020> be<00:01:42.140> done<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.560> pinch<00:01:43.370> it<00:01:43.610> also<00:01:44.180> if

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
should be done and pinch it also if

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.250 
should be done and pinch it also if
pinching<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.070> helps<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.480> density<00:01:47.750> of

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
pinching it helps to know the density of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.190 
pinching it helps to know the density of
the<00:01:48.410> lock<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:50.090> want<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.510> lock<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.930> be<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
the lock and you want the lock to be the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.510 
the lock and you want the lock to be the
same<00:01:51.440> consistency<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.880> rest<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.450> also

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.390 

continue<00:01:58.520> doing<00:01:58.760> this<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.910> little<00:01:59.150> bit

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.910 

now<00:02:02.940> when<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> luck<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.800> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
now when I have some of the luck some of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.650 
now when I have some of the luck some of
the<00:02:05.010> base<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.520> hair<00:02:05.730> already<00:02:06.090> locked<00:02:06.330> in

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
the base of the hair already locked in

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.290 
the base of the hair already locked in
here<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.170> noticed<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.700> thick<00:02:09.060> as

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
here I noticed that it's not as thick as

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720 
here I noticed that it's not as thick as
I<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.550> I'm<00:02:11.640> going

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
diagonal motion and actually pull the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.000 
diagonal motion and actually pull the
bait<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.830> rest<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> lock<00:02:17.810> into<00:02:18.810> more<00:02:19.740> into

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
bait the rest of the lock into more into

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.580 
bait the rest of the lock into more into
the<00:02:20.160> scalp<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.900> what<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.020> does<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the scalp and what this does is it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.790 
the scalp and what this does is it
actually<00:02:22.770> thickens<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> locks<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
actually thickens up the locks so if the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.450 
actually thickens up the locks so if the
locks<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.280> done<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.990> portion<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.080> hair<00:02:28.460> that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
locks are done on a portion of hair that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.680 
locks are done on a portion of hair that
may<00:02:30.240> not<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.750> thick<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:33.150> rest<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.570> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
may not be as thick as the rest of the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.940 
may not be as thick as the rest of the
lock<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.920> of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
lock like this one here this is one of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.940 
lock like this one here this is one of
the<00:02:41.100> ones<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.730> really<00:02:42.060> beneficial<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the ones that it's really beneficial to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
the ones that it's really beneficial to
pull<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.290> rest<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> hair<00:02:47.540> towards<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
pull in the rest of the hair towards the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.470 
pull in the rest of the hair towards the
base<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.760> actually<00:02:50.940> makes<00:02:51.300> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
base of it so that it actually makes it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.150 
base of it so that it actually makes it
thicker<00:02:52.820> at<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> base<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.590> even<00:02:56.040> though

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
thicker at the base so even though

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
thicker at the base so even though
there's<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.490> much<00:02:56.700> hair<00:02:57.030> that's<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.630> into

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
there's not much hair that's going into

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.310 
there's not much hair that's going into
this<00:02:58.020> lock<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.650> still<00:02:59.340> has<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.550> good<00:02:59.670> thickness

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
this lock it still has a good thickness

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.860 
this lock it still has a good thickness
because<00:03:01.320> I've<00:03:01.680> pulled<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.820> lot<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.390> other

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
because I've pulled a lot of the other

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.860 
because I've pulled a lot of the other
hairs<00:03:04.260> from<00:03:04.770> previous<00:03:05.400> walking's<00:03:05.880> into<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
hairs from previous walking's into the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:26.920 
hairs from previous walking's into the
base

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.830 

it's<00:03:27.440> good<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.950> wrap<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.909> hairs<00:03:29.150> around<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
it's good to wrap the hairs around the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.600 
it's good to wrap the hairs around the
lock<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:32.110> then<00:03:33.110> pull<00:03:33.530> them<00:03:33.739> back<00:03:33.920> through<00:03:34.190> by

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
lock and then pull them back through by

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.070 
lock and then pull them back through by
wrapping<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> hairs<00:03:35.330> around<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.870> lock

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
wrapping the hairs around the lock

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.850 
wrapping the hairs around the lock
they're<00:03:36.830> not<00:03:37.069> as<00:03:37.280> loose<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.000> as<00:03:38.299> frayed<00:03:38.860> so

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
they're not as loose and as frayed so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.520 
they're not as loose and as frayed so
it's<00:03:40.010> much<00:03:40.190> easier<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.670> pull<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.450> loose<00:03:42.260> hairs

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it's much easier to pull the loose hairs

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770 
it's much easier to pull the loose hairs
back<00:03:42.739> into<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.220> lock<00:03:43.340> if<00:03:43.549> their<00:03:44.450> first

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
back into the lock if their first

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.159 
back into the lock if their first
wrapped<00:03:45.170> around<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.560> lock<00:03:45.769> itself
