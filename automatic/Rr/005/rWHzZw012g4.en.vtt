I<00:02:11.500> guess<00:02:12.100> tablespoon<00:02:12.760> or<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:14.620> really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
I guess tablespoon or so I don't really

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.160 
I guess tablespoon or so I don't really
like<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.430> measure<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> paint<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:19.170> take

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
like to measure and paint like that take

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.300 
like to measure and paint like that take
a<00:02:20.290> handful<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.860> spinach<00:02:21.640> oh<00:02:25.739> maybe<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.160> add

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
a handful of spinach oh maybe we can add

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.220 
a handful of spinach oh maybe we can add
some<00:02:27.340> more<00:02:27.940> after<00:02:28.090> its<00:02:28.420> lens<00:02:28.720> because<00:02:29.019> there's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
some more after its lens because there's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:46.949 
some more after its lens because there's
not<00:02:29.470> much<00:02:29.620> room<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.690> where's<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.840> cover<00:02:45.959> think

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
not much room and where's to cover think

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.370 
not much room and where's to cover think
I<00:02:47.080> need<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:48.090> fill<00:02:49.090> help<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.660> bit<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.230> my

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
I need to fill help a little bit to my

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.680 
I need to fill help a little bit to my
blender<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.310> can't<00:02:52.030> reach<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
blender because it can't reach the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.490 
blender because it can't reach the
greens

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.810 

so<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.790> actually<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:04.820> liquefied

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
so now that it is actually a liquefied

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.780 
so now that it is actually a liquefied
everything<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:11.040> probably<00:03:11.430> adds<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.640> little

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
everything I it probably adds a little

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.140 
everything I it probably adds a little
bit<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:11.970> spinach<00:03:14.510> not<00:03:15.510> too<00:03:15.660> much<00:03:17.150> spinach

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
bit more spinach not too much spinach

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.170 
bit more spinach not too much spinach

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
doesn't really have a any taste in the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.890 
doesn't really have a any taste in the

aspartame<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.170> sucralose<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:54.300> use

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
aspartame and sucralose I just use

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.070 
aspartame and sucralose I just use
stevia<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.910> little<00:03:57.360> bit<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.630> stevia<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
stevia but a little bit of stevia to

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.530 
stevia but a little bit of stevia to
make<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.709> little<00:03:59.220> sweeter<00:03:59.459> and<00:04:02.480> probably<00:04:03.480> I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
make it a little sweeter and probably I

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.540 
make it a little sweeter and probably I
need<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:03.930> bit<00:04:04.110> more<00:04:04.380> orange<00:04:05.010> juice<00:04:05.070> to

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
need a little bit more orange juice to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:14.459 
need a little bit more orange juice to
make<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:07.100> make<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.130> blend<00:04:08.459> easier

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.580 

so<00:04:15.469> it<00:04:15.620> blended<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.449> things<00:04:17.449> like<00:04:17.539> 30<00:04:18.079> seconds

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
so it blended for things like 30 seconds

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.789 
so it blended for things like 30 seconds
maybe<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.919> minute<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:20.269> let's<00:04:20.900> see<00:04:21.139> what<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.560> got

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
to make go down better but it's not it's

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.060 
to make go down better but it's not it's
not<00:06:18.140> as<00:06:18.320> that<00:06:20.080> as<00:06:21.080> I<00:06:21.230> first<00:06:21.500> thought<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.950> would

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
not as that as I first thought it would

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.050 
not as that as I first thought it would
be<00:06:22.220> actually<00:06:22.970> if<00:06:23.540> it<00:06:23.780> sits<00:06:24.460> for<00:06:25.460> like<00:06:25.670> I<00:06:25.910> don't

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
be actually if it sits for like I don't

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.650 
be actually if it sits for like I don't
know<00:06:26.330> 10<00:06:26.870> minutes<00:06:27.110> 20<00:06:27.860> minutes<00:06:28.130> in<00:06:28.310> the<00:06:28.400> fridge

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
know 10 minutes 20 minutes in the fridge

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.360 
know 10 minutes 20 minutes in the fridge
then<00:06:29.660> it<00:06:30.460> kind<00:06:31.460> of<00:06:31.810> flavors<00:06:33.340> compensate<00:06:34.340> each

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
then it kind of flavors compensate each

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.110 
then it kind of flavors compensate each
other<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:35.710> becomes<00:06:36.710> very<00:06:36.980> different<00:06:37.910> taste

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
other and becomes very different taste

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.530 
other and becomes very different taste
than<00:06:38.240> then<00:06:38.930> it's<00:06:39.200> right<00:06:39.440> after<00:06:39.770> you<00:06:39.860> blend<00:06:40.540> so

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
than then it's right after you blend so

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.420 
than then it's right after you blend so
