thing here when you check this box on
and<00:01:21.000> off<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.509> color<00:01:21.780> change<00:01:22.909> reason

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and off you can see color change reason

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.249 
and off you can see color change reason
being<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.650> worked<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.130> color<00:01:26.369> space

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
being is that the worked in color space

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.300 
being is that the worked in color space
if<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.590> image<00:01:28.799> has<00:01:28.829> no<00:01:29.579> assigned<00:01:30.299> profile

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
if the image has no assigned profile

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
if the image has no assigned profile
Photoshop<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.549> assign<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.240> working<00:01:33.630> color

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Photoshop will assign the working color

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.260 
Photoshop will assign the working color
space<00:01:34.320> profile<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> image<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.920> case

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
space profile to that image in this case

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.899

what<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.390> checked<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.460> well<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.729> was

is for example if I open an image that's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
is for example if I open an image that's
not<00:02:17.159> in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> working<00:02:17.700> color<00:02:17.909> space<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.269> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
not in the working color space and I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.600 
not in the working color space and I
open<00:02:20.959> okay<00:02:21.959> let's<00:02:22.170> let<00:02:22.439> me<00:02:22.530> open<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.860> 1998

see it's flagging it okay it says
there's<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> mismatch<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.459> got

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
there's a mismatch because because I got

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.420 
there's a mismatch because because I got
srgb<00:02:31.019> working<00:02:31.349> color<00:02:31.530> space<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.189> trying

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
srgb working color space but it's trying

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
srgb working color space but it's trying
to<00:02:32.519> open<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.909> need<00:02:33.060> profile<00:02:33.540> say<00:02:33.780> okay<00:02:34.230> just

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to open and I need profile say okay just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.160 
to open and I need profile say okay just
leave<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.239> come<00:02:36.239> up<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> file<00:02:36.810> save<00:02:37.109> as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
leave it I come up here to file save as

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.699 
leave it I come up here to file save as
you<00:02:38.329> can<00:02:39.329> see<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> checkbox<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.260> checked<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
you can see the checkbox is checked it's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.599 
you can see the checkbox is checked it's
1998<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.720> has<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.319> profile<00:02:43.859> attached<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.519> it

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
1998 so it has a profile attached to it

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.960 
1998 so it has a profile attached to it
but<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:44.970> point<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.470> if<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.799> back<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> color

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
but my point is if I go back to color

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.000 
but my point is if I go back to color
settings<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.959> working<00:02:49.290> color<00:02:49.500> space<00:02:49.799> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
settings in the working color space and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.990 
settings in the working color space and
I've<00:02:50.069> start<00:02:50.370> changing<00:02:50.879> these<00:02:51.440> you'll<00:02:52.440> notice

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
I've start changing these you'll notice

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
I've start changing these you'll notice
that<00:02:54.000> there's<00:02:54.269> no<00:02:54.510> there's<00:02:55.200> no<00:02:55.260> change<00:02:55.680> in

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that there's no there's no change in

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.089 
that there's no there's no change in
color<00:02:56.190> reason<00:02:56.970> being<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.500> image<00:02:58.799> has<00:02:59.069> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
color reason being is if the image has a

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.179 
color reason being is if the image has a
profile<00:02:59.790> already<00:03:00.060> attached<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.139> in<00:03:01.980> this

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
profile already attached to it in this

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.599 
profile already attached to it in this
case<00:03:02.269> 1998<00:03:03.650> working<00:03:04.650> color<00:03:04.859> space<00:03:05.159> doesn't

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
case 1998 working color space doesn't

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.530 
case 1998 working color space doesn't
matter<00:03:05.790> anymore<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
matter anymore you know it's it so the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.059 
matter anymore you know it's it so the
only<00:03:09.659> reason<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.139> need<00:03:10.439> a<00:03:10.470> working<00:03:10.829> color

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
only reason you need a working color

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.270 
only reason you need a working color
space<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.879> if<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.260> doesn't<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> profile

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
space is if it doesn't have a profile

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.399 
space is if it doesn't have a profile
then<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.609> can<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.879> do<00:03:15.030> save<00:03:15.329> as<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.139> what

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
then you can just do save as and what

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.319 
then you can just do save as and what
you<00:03:16.530> see<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.829> what<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.069> get<00:03:17.810> when<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.930> save<00:03:19.199> it

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
you see is what you get when you save it

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.119 
you see is what you get when you save it
or<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:23.609> gotta<00:03:23.819> be<00:03:23.849> kidding<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.329> know<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.810> got

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
or you gotta be kidding you know you got

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.379 
or you gotta be kidding you know you got
mismatched<00:03:26.129> images<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.879> want<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.120> flag

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
mismatched images and you want to flag

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.119 
mismatched images and you want to flag
them<00:03:27.599> because<00:03:27.989> basically<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.680> want<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
them because basically you want all the

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.030 
them because basically you want all the
images<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.609> be<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.909> same<00:03:30.150> color<00:03:30.419> space<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.650> all

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
images to be the same color space so all

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.430 
images to be the same color space so all
the<00:03:32.159> colors<00:03:32.489> match<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> those<00:03:34.199> are<00:03:34.349> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the colors match so those are the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.369 
the colors match so those are the
reasons<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.010> working<00:03:35.310> color<00:03:35.549> space<00:03:36.379> okay

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
reasons for the working color space okay

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.890 
reasons for the working color space okay
so<00:03:37.440> let's<00:03:37.709> let's<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.579> let's<00:03:38.849> go<00:03:38.970> back<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.389> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
so let's let's get let's go back to the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.899 
so let's let's get let's go back to the
image<00:03:40.139> with<00:03:40.379> no<00:03:41.150> color<00:03:42.150> space<00:03:42.919> okay<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.609> we'll

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
image with no color space okay and we'll

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.140 
image with no color space okay and we'll
hit<00:03:45.030> OK<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:45.829> now<00:03:46.829> I'm<00:03:46.979> going<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.190> go<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.819> sign

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
hit OK and now I'm going to go to a sign

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.899 
hit OK and now I'm going to go to a sign
of<00:03:48.299> profile<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:48.840> edit<00:03:50.599> assign<00:03:51.599> profile<00:03:52.909> okay

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
of profile so edit assign profile okay

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.819 
of profile so edit assign profile okay
so<00:03:55.639> if<00:03:56.639> we<00:03:57.239> come<00:03:57.389> down<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.690> profile<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.620> go

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
so if we come down to profile and I go

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:06.080 
so if we come down to profile and I go
to<00:03:59.030> okay<00:04:00.079> let's<00:04:01.079> say<00:04:01.590> 1998<00:04:03.260> which<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.940> hit<00:04:05.940> this

sign<00:04:27.389> too

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
sign too

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.990 
sign too
until<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.230> assign<00:04:28.530> one<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.370> what<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.760> sign

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
until you assign one and what this sign

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.590 
until you assign one and what this sign
profile<00:04:30.510> does<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.970> assigns<00:04:33.420> a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
profile does is it just assigns a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360 
profile does is it just assigns a
profile<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.170> doesn't<00:04:34.530> change<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.890> numbers

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
profile it doesn't change the numbers

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.820 
profile it doesn't change the numbers
behind<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.970> screen<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:37.050> what<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.560> see<00:04:37.710> is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
behind the screen but what you see is

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.040 
behind the screen but what you see is
what<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.340> after<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.120> assign<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.480> profile

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
what you get after you assign a profile

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.680 
what you get after you assign a profile
so<00:04:40.590> typically<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.280> want<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.640> sign<00:04:41.910> profile<00:04:42.360> and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
so typically you want a sign profile and

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.170 
so typically you want a sign profile and
where<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.590> would<00:04:43.710> use<00:04:43.920> this<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.910> if<00:04:45.090> it

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
where you would use this is like if it

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.170 
where you would use this is like if it
has<00:04:45.330> no<00:04:45.540> profile<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.380> example<00:04:46.410> scanner<00:04:47.400> you

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
has no profile for example scanner you

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.400 
has no profile for example scanner you
scan<00:04:48.450> image<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> lot<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.020> times<00:04:49.170> they<00:04:49.320> don't

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
scan image a lot of times they don't

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.910 
scan image a lot of times they don't
have<00:04:49.560> profiles<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.350> what<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.470> print<00:04:52.770> you'll

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
have profiles so what you print you'll

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.650 
have profiles so what you print you'll
never<00:04:53.100> know<00:04:53.250> what<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.490> get<00:04:53.670> unless<00:04:54.030> you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
never know what you get unless you

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.390 
never know what you get unless you
assign<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.380> look<00:04:55.530> at<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.770> in<00:04:55.860> Photoshop

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
assign it and look at it in Photoshop

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.230 
assign it and look at it in Photoshop
before<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:57.120> print<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:58.040> or<00:04:59.040> like<00:04:59.940> if<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.120> get

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
before you print it or like if you get

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.510 
before you print it or like if you get
something<00:05:00.450> off<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.780> internet<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:02.130> has<00:05:02.190> no

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
something off the internet it has no

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.070 
something off the internet it has no
profile<00:05:02.940> that's<00:05:03.150> when<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.480> will<00:05:03.600> use<00:05:03.630> sign<00:05:03.960> up

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
profile that's when you will use sign up

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.880 
profile that's when you will use sign up
profile<00:05:04.470> okay<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> last<00:05:05.820> thing<00:05:06.620> okay<00:05:07.620> is

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
profile okay and the last thing okay is

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.470 
profile okay and the last thing okay is
convert<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.640> profile<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:09.150> I'm<00:05:09.210> going<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.390> open

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
convert to profile so I'm going to open

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.450 
convert to profile so I'm going to open
up<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.960> 1998<00:05:10.710> profile<00:05:11.130> again<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:13.400> okay<00:05:14.400> so

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
up the 1998 profile again and okay so

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.560 
up the 1998 profile again and okay so
now<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.850> come<00:05:15.120> down<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.690> edit<00:05:17.420> convert<00:05:18.420> to

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
now I come down to edit convert to

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.930 
now I come down to edit convert to
profile<00:05:19.250> okay<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:22.160> right<00:05:23.160> now<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.370> image<00:05:23.790> has

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
profile okay and right now the image has

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.090 
profile okay and right now the image has
a<00:05:23.970> 1998<00:05:24.690> profile<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.290> want<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.620> convert<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.010> in

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
a 1998 profile I want to convert it in

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.000 
a 1998 profile I want to convert it in
this<00:05:26.190> case<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.730> srgb<00:05:27.750> now<00:05:28.320> if<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.560> look<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.980> I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
this case to srgb now if you look and I

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.740 
this case to srgb now if you look and I
do<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.280> checkbox<00:05:29.760> there's<00:05:30.120> no<00:05:30.270> change<00:05:30.570> in

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
do the checkbox there's no change in

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.380 
do the checkbox there's no change in
color<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.860> reason<00:05:32.250> for<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:32.490> is<00:05:32.880> when<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.270> do

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
color the reason for that is when you do

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.200 
color the reason for that is when you do
convert<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.870> profile<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:35.070> maintains<00:05:35.880> the

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
convert to profile it maintains the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.470 
convert to profile it maintains the
color<00:05:36.630> of<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.770> image<00:05:37.890> on<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.490> screen<00:05:38.610> it'll

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
color of the image on the screen it'll

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.290 
color of the image on the screen it'll
change<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.870> numbers<00:05:40.350> behind<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.920> screen<00:05:41.310> but

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
change the numbers behind the screen but

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.570 
change the numbers behind the screen but
it's<00:05:43.169> going<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.440> look<00:05:43.500> like<00:05:43.650> what<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.160> see<00:05:44.430> is

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
it's going to look like what you see is

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.730 
it's going to look like what you see is
what<00:05:44.790> you<00:05:44.820> get<00:05:45.030> on<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.330> screen<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:46.020> where<00:05:46.620> you

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
what you get on the screen and where you

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.060 
what you get on the screen and where you
would<00:05:46.860> use<00:05:47.100> this<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:48.020> for<00:05:49.020> example<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.650> work<00:05:49.890> in

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
would use this is for example I work in

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.150 
would use this is for example I work in
1998<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.880> lot<00:05:51.150> because<00:05:51.390> I<00:05:51.540> have<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.810> monitor<00:05:52.350> that

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
1998 a lot because I have a monitor that

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.860 
1998 a lot because I have a monitor that
can<00:05:53.700> view<00:05:54.630> 1998<00:05:55.380> profiles<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.100> I<00:05:56.190> have<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.370> lab

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
can view 1998 profiles and I have a lab

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.280 
can view 1998 profiles and I have a lab
that<00:05:57.870> will<00:05:58.560> process<00:05:58.860> 1998<00:05:59.820> profiles<00:06:00.240> but<00:06:00.930> a

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
that will process 1998 profiles but a

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.159 
that will process 1998 profiles but a
lot<00:06:01.919> of<00:06:01.950> your<00:06:02.310> labs<00:06:02.700> for<00:06:03.540> example<00:06:03.870> if<00:06:03.930> you<00:06:04.020> take

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
lot of your labs for example if you take

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.270 
lot of your labs for example if you take
it<00:06:04.260> to<00:06:04.350> Walgreens<00:06:04.770> or<00:06:04.890> something<00:06:05.160> like<00:06:05.220> that

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
it to Walgreens or something like that

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.840 
it to Walgreens or something like that
they<00:06:06.240> need<00:06:06.300> an<00:06:06.540> sRGB<00:06:06.900> profile<00:06:07.860> so<00:06:08.100> that's<00:06:08.280> when

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
they need an sRGB profile so that's when

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.120 
they need an sRGB profile so that's when
you<00:06:08.970> would<00:06:09.150> do<00:06:09.419> convert<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.230> profile<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:11.010> in

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
you would do convert to profile so in

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.370 
you would do convert to profile so in
this<00:06:11.220> case<00:06:11.460> I<00:06:11.640> would<00:06:11.700> hit<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.450> ok<00:06:12.780> button<00:06:12.810> and

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
this case I would hit the ok button and

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.590 
this case I would hit the ok button and
convert<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.700> srgb<00:06:15.540> and<00:06:16.610> and<00:06:17.610> then<00:06:18.330> save

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
convert that the srgb and and then save

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.480 
convert that the srgb and and then save
that<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:19.110> then<00:06:19.290> that's<00:06:19.770> how<00:06:19.950> I<00:06:19.980> would<00:06:20.070> send<00:06:20.340> it

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
that and then that's how I would send it

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.390 
that and then that's how I would send it
off<00:06:20.610> to<00:06:20.940> say<00:06:21.240> Walgreens<00:06:21.720> anyway<00:06:22.500> that's<00:06:22.710> the

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
off to say Walgreens anyway that's the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.090 
off to say Walgreens anyway that's the
three<00:06:23.700> different<00:06:24.350> things<00:06:25.350> that<00:06:25.650> I<00:06:25.770> wanted<00:06:26.010> to

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
three different things that I wanted to
