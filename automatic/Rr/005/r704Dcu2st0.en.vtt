00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.830
 a rivalry that you know very well what kind of match 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.339
 you wait against the catrachos time 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'm sorry, but we're talking about guatemala 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 I am comfortable 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 Katherine Chile from Honduras

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.009
 recent crisis because I will always talk about what we are 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.090
 in front of the next match we will talk tomorrow little history 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.300
 this change the question chaco 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.739
 the adjustments of your crisis at half time the team can answer for 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.570
 first time below on the scoreboard in this unique cup this will work the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.650
 team with the changes 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.720
 on the other hand of the need that we had and we stayed 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.020
 to turn the marker 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.530
 and for reasons that empty 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.610
 running certain risks because they were already doing well they were plugging and 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.130
 they were counter-coupling with us drenthe shut up inaccuracies some 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.140
 Sometimes running more risks but good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.590
 is part of what we have to do to be able to turn the game around 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.260
 fortunately, the first goal suffered by the caller fell quickly 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.470
 we remain poised to continue working and be able to turn as osasuna 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.130
 fernán altuve however it is very different from hen 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.300
 for that of good humor no 7 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.360
 parts of what we hear that rescue that seems most important to them 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 a landfill or ee 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.240
 the game was waiting for him 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 I am very interested after everything I had done 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 to improve the second time 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.840
 but it was clear 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.770
 the changes derived 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.290
 but 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.220
 I think 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.440
 if I could handle perfectly 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 that was going to be against Honduras 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 what could it be 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.659
 I believe that my children and I answered chacón did not have why 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.009
 protest in that way so 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.899
 the prospects as they tie it but resist the fundamental change 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.039
 with the questions like they send them when the conscripts chopo for what 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.509
 Overcomes the questions that you choose or that you want because it a couple of 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.509
 Sometimes with the same answer you must be zero because he did not play in Mexico and that 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.989
 noticed that we do not have what good that you think surely effort 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.279
 of another question on offensive 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:31.789
 we want
