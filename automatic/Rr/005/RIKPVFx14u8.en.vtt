00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
actually use so let's jump back here
into<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> control<00:01:39.210> center<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.110> is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
into the control center and this is

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.780 
into the control center and this is
really<00:01:40.650> nice<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.640> any

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
really nice I mean if you don't have any

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
really nice I mean if you don't have any
tweets<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.540> tweaking<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.649> control

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
tweets that are tweaking your control

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
tweets that are tweaking your control
center<00:01:44.159> you'll<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.170> point

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
center you'll see that at this point

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
center you'll see that at this point
control<00:01:46.979> center<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.310> still<00:01:47.490> cool<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
control center is still cool but it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
control center is still cool but it
doesn't<00:01:48.540> look<00:01:48.659> near<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.079> cool<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
doesn't look near as cool as when it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.679 
doesn't look near as cool as when it's
modified<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.909> let's<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.210> ahead<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.390> swipe

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
modified so let's go ahead and swipe

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.389 
modified so let's go ahead and swipe
that<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.710> first<00:01:52.920> thing<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that down and the first thing we want to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
that down and the first thing we want to
get<00:01:53.490> rid<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.119> separators<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.320> we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
get rid of are these separators so if we

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
get rid of are these separators so if we
look<00:01:55.649> at<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.159> separators<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.820> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
look at that there's separators all in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
look at that there's separators all in
there<00:01:57.180> let's<00:01:57.479> toggle<00:01:57.689> those<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
there let's toggle those off now it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
there let's toggle those off now it
looks<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.790> much<00:02:00.030> better<00:02:00.299> another<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
looks that much better another thing to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
looks that much better another thing to
get<00:02:01.409> rid<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> media<00:02:03.000> controls

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
get rid of for me is the media controls

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.389 
get rid of for me is the media controls
because<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.719> never<00:02:03.780> used<00:02:04.290> those<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
because I never used those in the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
because I never used those in the
control<00:02:05.759> center<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> whole<00:02:06.930> lot

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
control center so now it's a whole lot

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.199 
control center so now it's a whole lot
shorter<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.129> cleaner<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.060> also

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
shorter and a lot cleaner you can also

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
shorter and a lot cleaner you can also
get<00:02:09.569> rid<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> settings<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.709> get<00:02:10.800> rid

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
get rid of the settings you can get rid

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.750 
get rid of the settings you can get rid
of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> brighten

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of the brighten

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940

so I don't really want to do that so you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.070 
so I don't really want to do that so you
can<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.060> jump<00:03:06.360> back<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.690> here

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
can see if we jump back in here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.220 
can see if we jump back in here
I'll<00:03:07.590> toggle<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.190> back<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.690> jump<00:03:10.590> back

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I'll toggle these back on and jump back

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.910 
I'll toggle these back on and jump back
and<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.830> will<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.820> copy<00:03:15.120> select<00:03:15.750> all<00:03:15.959> so

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and we will see the copy select all so

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.650 
and we will see the copy select all so
