00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.680
 as always I'm ax ax and this time I bring a video response to alex 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.119
 tucom papara complement what he said in his 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.289
 if they watched your video they will understand that there is stupid censorship wherever 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.570
 see to show examples of censorship I will take a series and videogames 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 I will show you different examples 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.900
 as the first example to take in the most censored series in history 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.560
 it arose 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 in this anime series you will find things like these 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 the letters were modified eliminating many details and in some cases 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.770
 completely changed 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.000
 magic and religious symbols were digitally modified so that 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.700
 appear in this includes changing stars by gem its still menting 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.600
 tips 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 remember the letter the circle of the spells 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 good an original man the curse of the former alhama 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.090
 it seems that in the United States people do not bleed or I do not know why they censor 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.440
 Every bloodstain, however minimal, seems stupid to me 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.800
 also scenes of violence were erased in this first demos like me and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.810
 company they are making fucking shit and fall on the ground hurt 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.140
 now there is another one is from a scene where already cure level sharply takes the eye 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 millennial to pegasus and the blood that comes out of it starts to run 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 neither do they apparently support images where nudity is shown even if 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 as absurd as this image 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 all text in Japanese digitally mutilated 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 cutting weapons and perforated bodies illuminated by the magic of the penta 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 look at this image here the dark magician is crucified appears they thought 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 that would be harmless and they changed it to a stone 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.050
 there are also changes that do not make sense until they are errors that both 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.360
 change of things but look at these letters 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 now let's see some very strong plot changes 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.520
 they remember the scene where the pegasus men enter the fall office and 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 having been able to defend himself he jumps through the window towards the waterfall without 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.050
 some apparent reason 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.650
 well with this you will understand a bit these scenes were changed and erased as 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.420
 they can see they had guns and they were firing at point-blank range to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.800
 kill here was falling in his despair he defends himself with what 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.390
 has at hand as a shield and takes the opportunity to escape by jumping from his office 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.999
 remember the yuji duel against reached where a disc of energy 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.079
 dark was approaching slowly when they lost life points was approaching and if 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.150
 it has touched someone his mind had been sent to the realm of shadows 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.449
 we believed in the shadows what the fuck 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.779
 in that season they often used the kingdom of shadows as an excuse 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.550
 to hide many real story arguments 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.440
 in this case that dark energy disk was an electric lock and the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.400
 he lost he was without legs 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.120
 to save themselves they will remember that there was a key in a box that is obtained when 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 one is defeated 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.629
 that represents the pandora's box 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.599
 At that moment Arcane tells the legend of Pandora's box where we make her 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.849
 gave a Pandora's box 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.870
 it is opened and all the evils of humanity came out 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 in the box only one thing remained the hope that would save the world 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.370
 the same thing happened with the double duel of umbra and lewis 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.380
 nothing to do with the kingdom of the shadows the one that was losing broke the floor of 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.980
 crystal and fell under vacuum 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.519
 that's why the two men of sea and kenya parachute prepared 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.089
 and it's not just in this anime other types of censorship is to change the drinks 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.339
 alcoholics for juice and change smokers because their dad scholarships 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:27.019
 now we will give an example in videogames final fantasy 4 that as was the second 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.939
 final fantasy in the united states and to hide that they did not get the final 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.039
 fantasy 2 and 3 called it stupidly final fantasy 2 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.389
 I'm not going to talk about system changes and difficulty let's talk 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.149
 directly from the censorship that although it did not find images that will explain it 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.919
 the r telling 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.219
 conversations softened in the conversation of cecil with pink rose not 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.249
 he tells him they'll see him then he says tonight again 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.149
 supposing they have been sleeping together for a while 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:59.469
 censored the dancer who took off her suit and got into a bikini in the water 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.019
 show that a synchronized swim 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.709
 erased texts as where Cecile explains that the lion issue had been 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.139
 returned to the receipt for self-defense due to the arrival of monsters 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.559
 aggressive 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.459
 they eliminated the porn magazine that came out in the room of the programmers and 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.609
 even the same room was deleted that magazine was simply an item that 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.360
 when using it, the screen turned red and cecil said some sentences 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.479
 changed the way the final boss that image yes I could find buy in the 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.059
 real image with this other shit 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.979
 besides changing magic joly by ugt or sacred by white 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.080
 also in the final fantasy 6 that in the United States called it final fantasy 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.409
 who knew things like that 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.389
 they censured the former president wearing it and many other things but I did not find 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.520
 margins to show you 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.680
 in short censorship is the stupidest way to ruin something and more when 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 is censored simply by censoring
