00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
 of the world as they make the videos 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.410
 because they make the videos where they come from 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.330
 both in the crazy story 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 the interviewee today is in iberê 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.369

 creates your record and edits and composes 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.070
 the trail of the videos the curious thing is that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.230
 he is neither scientist nor physicist nor 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.329
 mathematician neither actor nor music 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.520
 the guy is a journalist who by the way 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.320
 understands a lot about science and how 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 to present interesting solutions from a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 entertaining and didactic way and it is with this 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 Internet celebrity that we are going to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 Talking now, the shirt went to the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 his studio to exchange ideas 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.539
 It's only good, Douglas. I 'm good here. 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 headquarters workshop laboratory 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 studio with the iberê to discover 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 all the backstage of his videos 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.790
 talk to him now 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 good first hello all good all good 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 way however note the first place 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 it is necessary to know how this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.439
 history of videos was something that a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.479
 man must have out of nowhere or you planned 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 I did not really like making video 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 before giving up October at a time when 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.750
 youtube is the one that had three videos as well 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 little you still gave little star 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 I did not give a joke, I started to realize 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 that there is a wave of rain 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 people could teach things that she 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.070
 You know one to the other with countries 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.509
 and watched a Chinese videos and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.509
 I learned something with shiney. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.780
 but then when it started to explode have 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.000
 a moment like this on tv was in 2010 and 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.530
 I made a partnership with a blog and then I 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 I started putting video they gave 13 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.500
 thousand views 10 thousand views I started to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.630
 speak 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 Geez, and then I started to realize that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 audience for what the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.040
 People said I started to receive 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.900
 many suggestions of new things and people 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.240
 started all week from 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.830
 2010 he had all week now are 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.450
 three a week but that time was 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.520
 for weeks you ask yourself have a 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.290
 trick that makes you run in the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.170
 some internet science you follow 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.910
 those steps and it's going to happen, I always 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.560
 trick number one is periodicity then 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 have to publish one video per week if 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.890
 You do not publish this week, will not you? 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.030
 work and if you fail everyone 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 Are you going to be disappointed? 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.920
 you make a professional video is easy 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.830
 per week this will make the whole end of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.790
 week and it is discovered that the year has 52 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.730
 weeks 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.190
 and then I discovered that a week will fall on the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 Christmas another goes Mardi Gras Another is Cahino 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 in fact I already one by one 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 but it turned out to be your job anyway 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.800
 They did not steal another year and a half. 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.140
 I only do this, you have to be discreet. 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.270
 money and make money from it. 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.890
 I left my job of everything just to do 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.830
 not only make money but have a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.020
 team works with us, she's the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.590
 salary everyone gets paid with more 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.480
 views with one thing is you stay 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.070
 famous so people recognize you 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.230
 on the street and know and recognize when 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.180
 I go to the supermarket supermarket is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.520
 potatoes will always have someone will grow 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.440
 will cut mozzarella there the face of the goal 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.960
 is she that this change is pride is 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.880
 silvano por is very cool you see 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.920
 person that exists even if there is someone 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 on the other side and here inside the movie 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.510
 pact on camera, can not you see the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.880
 Such an amazing person finds himself 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.140
 really cool when it happens 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.330
 We sometimes delay an hour or so. 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.460
 two the video begins to rain the people 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.100
 sending and mail puts there in the comment 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.140
 of a video of your time waiting for the mother 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.360
 there is no difference in any work 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.510
 Do you have any kind of pressure to do 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.310
 then I think this is one of the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.200
 craft bones you have to face 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.600
 This obligation to agree I like 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.490
 very easy that I never imagined that a 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.440
 day you could see something that 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.450
 satisfied so much 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.060
 Now you're a training journalist. 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.300
 How is your relationship with science? 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.700
 You and I always really liked and when 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.070
 I worked already in relation to the work already 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.780
 in the area of ​​science and to close 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.760
 any tip would you give so much to who 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.580
 want to make videos and who is 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.650
 there on youtube made to go 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.480
 The main trick is to try to 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.430
 organize and try to make a project of 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.590
 fact that one wants to start a channel or 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.990
 the channel has started, try to make a 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.409
 list the next 50 birds and will do 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.839
 more 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.580
 a year will not be easy will need 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.349
 a little planning to think with who 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.499
 Are you going to spend and such? 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.599
 and you can go that way you know that 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:58.269
 that the legal gap 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.039
 Thank you very much for that, for example. You? 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:03.569
 every day, right on youtube 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.569
 It's cool to see the norm.
