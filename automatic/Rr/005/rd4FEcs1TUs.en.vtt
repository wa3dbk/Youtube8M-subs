00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.820
 presents the new color combination 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 of the panther oxygen with tradition of 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.940
 Christmas 2012-2013 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.280
 the aussie / yen pantel has been the glove 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.510
 most successful of this collection so 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.760
 we have so decided not to do any 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.110
 functional improvement only changes of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.810
 color to offer you a collection 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.040
 different the keys to this success are 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.020
 mainly the level of armed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.710
 glove the level of armed is achieved 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.870
 with all the technologies incorporate 2 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.239
 main as you can see in the image 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.160
 is the dual core window that is in the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.340
 center of the glove is a rubber window 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.079
 very light and thin but that has a 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.610
 small elastic component and that's going to 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.290
 contribute to putting the glove together 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.640
 Once this glove since that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.769
 elastic component make it not 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.320
 uncomfortable will not allow to notice the hand 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.910
 more protected 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.680
 The rest of the material on the back is a 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.089
 synthetic latex as we can see also 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 has a thickness is higher than average 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.860
 we can see it in these hard areas that 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 can not be done is a palm of the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:17.040
 surplus more maximums that we are 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.470
 the rest of the body of the tissue of the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 base also moves in the cuts of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 the fingers and on the thumb of tissues 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.869
 months has an average armed level and what 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 that has allowed us to ventilate the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.619
 inside of the hand is to say both casal 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.570
 also like the glove after a 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 much prolonged 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.440
 if we go to the palm zone we can 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 see that it's a mid-range latex being 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.870
 the glove and with and we always assemble the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 an immense palm is the grammy palm 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.580
 is the goalkeepers with medium grip and a 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.280
 duration so volume the reason why 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.960
 gloves come out and so and are so sensitive 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 like the high-end gloves with for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 machinery the chosen cut is the cut 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the finger yes let's make a glove 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 armed and cutting the fingers of more 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 suitable to get the feeling a 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.229
 of the units that we introduce in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.180
 summer the crankcase and not many then the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740
 angular finish after the top of 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.290
 the fingers 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
 we increase the surface area of 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.800
 latex in this area of the buds that at 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630
 final are the parties most involved in 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.700
 the link 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.560
 if we put endurance laterally 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.330
 we can see that it has cutting and bending 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.360
 a claw shape that is the action 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.920
 correct technique of the bad room and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.480
 also in the area of maximum voltage of 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.580
 the palm the area by abc over breaks the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.740
 glove we have introduced this earring 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.200
 steel that you can see gray and the 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.730
 stent and very elastic and has allowed 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.610
 any aggressive action that you do with 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.120
 The palm placement clear the glove 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.530
 us in this area 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 if we go to the classic wristband it's 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.690
 say the elastic with two points of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.890
 Velcro fastening and a closing strip 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.540
 a little bit wider than usual for 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.890
 get fix in the best way 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.890
 possible the glove to your
