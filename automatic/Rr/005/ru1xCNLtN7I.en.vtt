taken and when it's done downloading the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
information it's going to start showing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.170 
information it's going to start showing
that<00:02:37.900> slideshow<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:39.160> uses<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.490> lot<00:02:39.910> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
that slideshow it actually uses a lot of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.570 
that slideshow it actually uses a lot of
local<00:02:41.020> map<00:02:41.200> information<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.920> do<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
local map information to do this and so

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.820 
local map information to do this and so
it's<00:02:42.760> got<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.060> download<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> lot<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.020> has<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
it's got to download a lot it has to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.260 
it's got to download a lot it has to
download<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> first<00:02:45.490> time<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.970> do<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
download the first time that you do this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.820 
download the first time that you do this
but<00:02:46.510> once<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.810> play<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.050> slideshow<00:02:47.500> after

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
but once you play the slideshow after

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
but once you play the slideshow after
this<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.160> never<00:02:48.310> has<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.670> go<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.940> download<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
this it never has to go and download it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.000 
this it never has to go and download it
again<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.320> if<00:02:50.380> you're<00:02:50.440> making<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.800> slideshow

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
again so if you're making a slideshow

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.220 
again so if you're making a slideshow
for<00:02:51.490> an<00:02:51.610> event<00:02:51.850> it's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> good<00:02:52.270> idea<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.600> play<00:02:53.110> it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
for an event it's a good idea to play it

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.410 
for an event it's a good idea to play it
once<00:02:53.440> through<00:02:53.710> before<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.280> event<00:02:54.520> starts<00:02:54.580> so

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
once through before the event starts so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.250 
once through before the event starts so
you<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.900> wait<00:02:56.020> while<00:02:56.230> it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
you don't have to wait while it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:44.650 
you don't have to wait while it
downloads<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.890> maps

the<00:06:09.850> first<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.240> which<00:06:10.360> was<00:06:10.420> that<00:06:10.690> it<00:06:11.140> tagged

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
the first of which was that it tagged

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.830 
the first of which was that it tagged
almost<00:06:12.250> completely<00:06:13.000> perfectly<00:06:13.420> all<00:06:13.690> the

almost completely perfectly all the
locations<00:06:14.170> it<00:06:14.860> knew<00:06:15.070> i<00:06:15.100> was<00:06:15.370> at<00:06:15.490> Glasgow

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
locations it knew i was at Glasgow

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.720 
locations it knew i was at Glasgow

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
some of the towns were too remote to

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.480 
some of the towns were too remote to
really<00:06:22.390> register<00:06:23.170> as<00:06:23.320> where<00:06:23.500> they<00:06:23.620> were<00:06:23.680> in

really register as where they were in

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.370 
really register as where they were in
those<00:06:24.820> cases<00:06:25.060> that<00:06:25.390> just<00:06:25.570> said<00:06:25.690> Scotland<00:06:26.230> if

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
those cases that just said Scotland if

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.460 
those cases that just said Scotland if
you<00:06:26.830> go<00:06:26.980> into<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.430> places<00:06:28.060> setting<00:06:28.840> inside<00:06:29.260> of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
you go into the places setting inside of

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.250 
you go into the places setting inside of
iPhoto<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:30.490> can<00:06:30.610> tell<00:06:31.450> something<00:06:31.900> where<00:06:32.110> the

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
iPhoto you can tell something where the

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.710 
iPhoto you can tell something where the
place<00:06:32.500> is<00:06:32.530> and<00:06:33.040> so<00:06:33.130> if<00:06:33.460> for<00:06:33.820> example<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:34.360> went<00:06:34.540> to

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
place is and so if for example I went to

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.870 
place is and so if for example I went to
places<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.410> I<00:06:35.830> told<00:06:36.070> something<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:36.580> where

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
places and I told something that where

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.210 
places and I told something that where
it<00:06:36.970> said<00:06:37.150> dufftown<00:06:37.600> was<00:06:37.870> actually<00:06:38.350> at<00:06:38.710> the

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
it said dufftown was actually at the

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.460 
it said dufftown was actually at the
glenfiddich<00:06:39.910> distillery<00:06:40.420> then<00:06:41.020> the

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
glenfiddich distillery then the

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.900 
glenfiddich distillery then the
slideshow<00:06:41.890> would<00:06:42.040> have<00:06:42.130> displayed<00:06:42.520> that<00:06:42.670> but

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
slideshow would have displayed that but

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.540 
slideshow would have displayed that but
it's<00:06:43.090> just<00:06:43.360> by<00:06:43.630> default<00:06:43.960> looking<00:06:44.350> up<00:06:44.500> based<00:06:45.430> on

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
it's just by default looking up based on

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.490 
it's just by default looking up based on
your<00:06:45.670> proximity<00:06:46.030> of<00:06:46.330> things<00:06:46.570> where<00:06:46.900> you<00:06:47.110> are<00:06:47.290> I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
your proximity of things where you are I

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.290 
your proximity of things where you are I
think<00:06:47.770> that's<00:06:47.920> incredibly<00:06:48.400> interesting<00:06:49.120> the

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
think that's incredibly interesting the

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.610 
think that's incredibly interesting the
second<00:06:49.660> thing<00:06:49.780> that<00:06:49.810> you'll<00:06:50.050> notice<00:06:50.110> is<00:06:50.560> that

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
second thing that you'll notice is that

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.980 
second thing that you'll notice is that
these<00:06:50.980> two<00:06:51.160> videos<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.790> we<00:06:51.880> had<00:06:52.120> played<00:06:52.780> in

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
these two videos that we had played in

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.870 
these two videos that we had played in
their<00:06:53.110> entirety<00:06:53.680> and<00:06:53.770> so<00:06:54.010> you<00:06:54.070> can<00:06:54.340> display<00:06:54.730> a

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
their entirety and so you can display a

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.180 
their entirety and so you can display a
slideshow<00:06:55.420> of<00:06:55.450> not<00:06:55.810> only<00:06:56.050> photos<00:06:56.230> but<00:06:57.010> your

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
slideshow of not only photos but your

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.650 
slideshow of not only photos but your
videos<00:06:57.520> and<00:06:57.550> since<00:06:58.000> these<00:06:58.090> videos<00:06:58.450> were<00:06:58.630> taken

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
videos and since these videos were taken

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.980 
videos and since these videos were taken
on<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.320> iPhone<00:06:59.680> the<00:07:00.180> iPhone<00:07:01.180> recorded<00:07:01.870> the

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
on the iPhone the iPhone recorded the

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.140 
on the iPhone the iPhone recorded the
GPS<00:07:02.470> information<00:07:02.860> about<00:07:03.460> where<00:07:03.610> these<00:07:03.790> videos

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
GPS information about where these videos

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.730 
GPS information about where these videos
were<00:07:04.330> taken<00:07:04.360> as<00:07:04.960> well<00:07:05.140> as<00:07:05.230> where<00:07:05.350> the<00:07:05.440> photos

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
were taken as well as where the photos

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.740 
were taken as well as where the photos
were<00:07:05.890> taken<00:07:06.040> it<00:07:06.910> also<00:07:07.060> put<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.390> photos<00:07:07.660> in

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
were taken it also put the photos in

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.990 
were taken it also put the photos in
order<00:07:08.169> for<00:07:08.530> me<00:07:08.770> based<00:07:09.040> on<00:07:09.220> the<00:07:09.280> trip<00:07:09.700> and<00:07:09.880> so

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
order for me based on the trip and so

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.810 
order for me based on the trip and so
the<00:07:10.270> GPS<00:07:10.690> information<00:07:10.950> tells<00:07:11.950> it<00:07:12.160> when<00:07:12.430> and

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
the GPS information tells it when and

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.970 
the GPS information tells it when and
where<00:07:13.180> you<00:07:13.480> were<00:07:13.870> when<00:07:14.110> the<00:07:14.290> photos<00:07:14.830> were

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
where you were when the photos were

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.210 
where you were when the photos were
taken<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.490> so<00:07:16.000> the<00:07:16.650> slideshow<00:07:17.650> puts<00:07:17.980> together

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
taken and so the slideshow puts together

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.550 
taken and so the slideshow puts together
those<00:07:18.850> bits<00:07:19.300> of<00:07:19.390> information<00:07:19.660> and<00:07:20.230> it<00:07:20.320> makes

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
those bits of information and it makes

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.470 
those bits of information and it makes
the<00:07:20.770> path<00:07:21.040> from<00:07:21.610> one<00:07:21.790> place<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.060> another<00:07:22.240> I

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
the path from one place to another I

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.030 
the path from one place to another I
didn't<00:07:22.750> have<00:07:22.870> to<00:07:22.990> tell<00:07:23.140> it<00:07:23.320> when<00:07:23.530> i<00:07:23.560> was<00:07:23.890> at

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
didn't have to tell it when i was at

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.830 
didn't have to tell it when i was at
which<00:07:24.220> airport<00:07:24.400> and<00:07:24.910> where<00:07:25.180> i<00:07:25.210> went<00:07:25.450> after

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
which airport and where i went after

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.270 
which airport and where i went after
that<00:07:25.990> it<00:07:26.440> does<00:07:26.620> it<00:07:26.740> all<00:07:26.830> completely

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
that it does it all completely

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.370 
that it does it all completely
automatically<00:07:27.940> for<00:07:28.330> me<00:07:28.419> I<00:07:28.630> think<00:07:29.020> this<00:07:29.080> is<00:07:29.260> an

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
automatically for me I think this is an

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.430 
automatically for me I think this is an
incredibly<00:07:30.010> powerful<00:07:30.100> reason<00:07:30.880> to<00:07:31.180> use<00:07:31.510> iPhoto

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 
incredibly powerful reason to use iPhoto

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.680 
incredibly powerful reason to use iPhoto
