00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to the inside so my halfback coaster

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.220 
to the inside so my halfback coaster
outside<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.320> what<00:02:57.500> happens<00:02:58.420> let's<00:02:59.420> just<00:02:59.780> let's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
outside so what happens let's just let's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.630 
outside so what happens let's just let's
take<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> look<00:03:01.990> he<00:03:02.990> all<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.470> sudden<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:04.160> spin

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
take a look he all of a sudden can spin

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.380 
take a look he all of a sudden can spin
around<00:03:04.670> even<00:03:05.570> though<00:03:05.720> he<00:03:06.020> was<00:03:06.230> clearly

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
around even though he was clearly

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.890 
around even though he was clearly
clearly<00:03:08.390> stuck<00:03:08.930> between<00:03:09.190> 75<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.300> 68<00:03:11.300> or<00:03:11.480> 60

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
clearly stuck between 75 and 68 or 60

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.020 
clearly stuck between 75 and 68 or 60
whoever<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:13.010> he<00:03:13.130> could<00:03:13.280> almost<00:03:13.430> sit<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.820> spin

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
whoever and he could almost sit and spin

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.450 
whoever and he could almost sit and spin
around<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.570> my<00:03:14.600> ball<00:03:14.930> carrier<00:03:15.320> now<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:16.250> I

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
around and get my ball carrier now if I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.700 
around and get my ball carrier now if I
didn't<00:03:16.730> know<00:03:16.880> how<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.480> use<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.930> spin<00:03:18.260> move<00:03:18.440> but

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
didn't know how to use the spin move but

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.530 
didn't know how to use the spin move but
know<00:03:18.890> if<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.130> wasn't<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.700> good<00:03:20.000> look<00:03:20.240> stick

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
know if I wasn't that good look stick

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.040 
know if I wasn't that good look stick
skills<00:03:20.990> then<00:03:22.210> 50<00:03:23.210> would<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.480> captured<00:03:23.900> my

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
skills then 50 would have captured my

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.380 
skills then 50 would have captured my
player<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:25.490> there's<00:03:25.790> nothing<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.180> could've

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
player and there's nothing I could've

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.940 
player and there's nothing I could've
done<00:03:26.600> about<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.960> even<00:03:27.140> though<00:03:27.380> he<00:03:27.560> shouldn't

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
done about it even though he shouldn't

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.470 
done about it even though he shouldn't
have<00:03:28.010> been<00:03:28.310> nowhere<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.330> display<00:03:31.360> he<00:03:32.360> is

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
have been nowhere in display he is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.230 
have been nowhere in display he is
somehow<00:03:32.750> able<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.380> spin<00:03:33.680> around<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.310> still

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
somehow able to spin around and still

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.060 
somehow able to spin around and still
pursue<00:03:35.650> my<00:03:36.650> ball<00:03:36.890> carrier<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.090> said<00:03:38.330> a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
pursue my ball carrier like I said a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.590 
pursue my ball carrier like I said a
positive<00:03:40.070> play<00:03:40.400> turned<00:03:41.210> bad<00:03:41.590> but<00:03:42.590> whenever

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
positive play turned bad but whenever

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.910 
positive play turned bad but whenever
whenever<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.720> first<00:03:45.080> did<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.350> play<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> didn't

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
whenever I first did this play I didn't

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.560 
whenever I first did this play I didn't
even<00:03:46.070> see<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.400> happen<00:03:46.580> cuz<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.090> happened<00:03:47.420> so

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
even see it happen cuz it happened so

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.290 
even see it happen cuz it happened so
fast<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.290> was<00:03:48.680> like<00:03:48.770> how<00:03:48.920> did<00:03:49.040> he<00:03:49.100> get<00:03:49.370> there<00:03:49.640> but

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
fast I was like how did he get there but

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.340 
fast I was like how did he get there but
then<00:03:50.390> when<00:03:50.480> you're<00:03:50.540> going<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.780> instant<00:03:51.080> replay

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
then when you're going to instant replay

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.460 
then when you're going to instant replay
you<00:03:51.410> see<00:03:51.740> how<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.190> happened<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.960> vary

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
you see how it happened you can vary

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.080 
you see how it happened you can vary
them<00:03:54.890> where<00:03:55.250> call<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.820> almost<00:03:56.350> cheating

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
them where call it almost cheating

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.770 
them where call it almost cheating
really<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.730> negative

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
really so this is a negative

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.660 
really so this is a negative
nullifying<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:04.010> positive

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.030 

now<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.210> wanna<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.570> want<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.930> sum<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.710> on<00:04:13.980> a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
now I wanna I want to sum it up on on a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.970 
now I wanna I want to sum it up on on a
positive<00:04:14.730> note<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.840> show<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.140> there

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
positive note just to show that there

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.220 
positive note just to show that there
can<00:04:17.370> be<00:04:17.400> positives<00:04:18.269> in<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:18.660> game<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
can be positives in this game the

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.300 
can be positives in this game the
Infinity<00:04:19.680> engine<00:04:19.859> shows<00:04:21.680> greatness<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:22.920> this

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
Infinity engine shows greatness on this

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.580 
Infinity engine shows greatness on this
plate<00:04:23.640> which<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.270> doesn't<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.750> don't<00:04:24.810> see<00:04:25.320> too

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
plate which I doesn't I don't see too

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.370 
plate which I doesn't I don't see too
often<00:04:26.480> but<00:04:27.480> like<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.690> said<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.900> want<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.170> show<00:04:28.320> you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
often but like I said I want to show you

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.110 
often but like I said I want to show you
some<00:04:28.590> things<00:04:28.830> now<00:04:29.040> number<00:04:29.370> one<00:04:29.580> goes<00:04:29.820> up<00:04:30.030> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
some things now number one goes up the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.030 
some things now number one goes up the
middle<00:04:30.270> he<00:04:30.480> breaks<00:04:30.780> loose<00:04:31.080> as<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.800> see

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
middle he breaks loose as you can see

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.560 
middle he breaks loose as you can see
there's<00:04:32.280> two<00:04:32.340> players<00:04:32.760> trying<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.270> for<00:04:33.450> my

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
there's two players trying to go for my

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.810 
there's two players trying to go for my
players<00:04:33.870> feet<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.440> they<00:04:34.590> can't<00:04:34.920> succeed<00:04:35.640> in

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
players feet and they can't succeed in

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.470 
players feet and they can't succeed in
tackling<00:04:36.300> me<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:36.810> what<00:04:37.590> does<00:04:37.770> number<00:04:38.040> 41<00:04:38.610> do<00:04:38.880> he

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
tackling me so what does number 41 do he

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.560 
tackling me so what does number 41 do he
ends<00:04:39.870> up<00:04:40.020> tripping<00:04:40.740> over<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.700> players<00:04:42.000> taking

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
ends up tripping over the players taking

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.830 
ends up tripping over the players taking
himself<00:04:42.780> out<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.680> plate<00:04:43.980> so<00:04:44.850> now<00:04:45.120> all<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.450> have

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
himself out the plate so now all I have

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.340 
himself out the plate so now all I have
is<00:04:46.140> number<00:04:46.710> five<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.310> worry<00:04:47.550> about

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
is number five to worry about

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.930 
is number five to worry about
he<00:04:49.350> breaks<00:04:49.620> number<00:04:50.040> five<00:04:50.310> tackle<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:52.940> 35

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
he breaks number five tackle and 35

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.170 
he breaks number five tackle and 35
trips<00:04:54.450> over<00:04:54.980> number<00:04:55.980> five<00:04:56.190> now<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:57.000> say

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
trips over number five now you can say

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.780 
trips over number five now you can say
his<00:04:57.330> lack<00:04:57.570> of<00:04:57.750> awareness<00:04:57.870> which<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:59.370> know<00:04:59.490> in

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
his lack of awareness which you know in

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.159 
his lack of awareness which you know in
real<00:05:00.150> life<00:05:00.360> they<00:05:00.510> probably<00:05:00.750> would<00:05:01.140> have

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
real life they probably would have

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.930 
real life they probably would have
jumped<00:05:01.590> over<00:05:01.680> it<00:05:01.919> but<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.550> fact<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:02.910> matter

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
jumped over it but the fact the matter

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.120 
jumped over it but the fact the matter
is<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.630> Infinity<00:05:04.080> engine<00:05:04.290> played<00:05:04.890> out<00:05:05.100> right

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
is the Infinity engine played out right

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.240 
is the Infinity engine played out right
and<00:05:05.730> just<00:05:06.690> because<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.140> players<00:05:07.410> didn't<00:05:07.860> jump

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
and just because the players didn't jump

but then a bad play kill it at the end
my<00:05:31.320> example<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.160> is<00:05:33.080> let's<00:05:34.080> say<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.290> player

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
my example of that is let's say a player

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.350 
my example of that is let's say a player
let's<00:05:35.040> say<00:05:35.160> you're<00:05:35.340> playing<00:05:35.370> on<00:05:35.760> defense<00:05:36.180> and

let's say you're playing on defense and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.960 
let's say you're playing on defense and
you<00:05:36.450> have<00:05:36.890> three<00:05:37.890> positive<00:05:38.460> place

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
you have three positive place

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.170 
you have three positive place
you're<00:05:39.540> losing<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.140> need<00:05:40.290> to<00:05:40.410> make<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.560> stop

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
you're losing you need to make a stop

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.969

you stop the defense three times and
it's<00:05:44.520> fourth<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:45.030> five<00:05:45.800> now<00:05:46.800> let's<00:05:47.040> say<00:05:47.160> the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
it's fourth and five now let's say the

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.909 
it's fourth and five now let's say the
