 cotton candy one teaspoon 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.149
 water and half a teaspoon of icing sugar 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.380
 The first thing we are going to do in our 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.330
 chocolate cake 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 so we will mix all the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 ingredients in a bowl 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 we will start throwing the eggs 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.900
 we will beat the eggs a little bit first 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.720
 and we are going to add the icing sugar 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 and mixing well 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.030
 As you can see, everything has been mixed well 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 Now we go throwing flour little 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.870
 little sifting the and we'll say it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.870
 incorporating 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.990
 then we will throw the cocoa powder 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.570
 sifting it and we will mix it well and for 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.510
 last we will pour the teaspoon of water 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.730
 tempered and we will continue stirring in this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.250
 point we can preheat the oven to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.260
 200 degrees while it warms us 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.600
 the furnace will take advantage of to lubricate the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.000
 mold with butter we will take a 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.400
 bit and we will go 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.020
 You can also do with a brush no 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.810
 you have to make a hand but to me 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.020
 like to do it like that we already have it 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.900
 oiled 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.230
 next we will be the mixture of 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.230
 Biscuit 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.019
 we'll put it in the oven for 15 to 25 minutes 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.019
 at 180 degrees 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.140
 and we have our cake ready 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.940
 that we will take it out of the oven and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 we will let cool now let's do 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.420
 the mini cupcakes the first thing we're going to 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.420
 to do is mix the egg with the sugar 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.599
 then we will throw the butter 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.510
 softened and we will continue mixing well 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.370
 Now we will mix the yeast with the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.370
 flour and we will throw it to the bowl 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.000
 now let's pour the milk 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.060
 now we will throw the vanilla and finally 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.060
 we will add cocoa 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.340
 we already have everything mixed now what 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.440
 let's take in the capsules 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.240
 then we put the capsules inside 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.449
 of the mold in this case only 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.340
 we will need 5 mini cupcakes but 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.949
 yeah if you have a leftover mass you can do 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.400
 more we will fill the capsules almost 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.400
 whole 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.049
 You see how a little bit of dough goes 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.089
 to put more capsules and we will take advantage 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:50.639
 everything once we have filled the 

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:52.529
 capsules will put it in the oven already 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.809
 is preheated because we have done the 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.719
 sponge cake before we put it in the oven 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:05:00.029
 about 10 minutes to 180 degrees once what 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.819
 We take out of the oven let them cool 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.249
 on a grid now let's do the 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.999
 chocolate coverage we will put a saucepan 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:11.609
 At minimum heat we will throw the polish and the 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.799
 butter and we will move it to 

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:16.139
 that chocolates melt once 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:19.039
 is the melted chocolate come on 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.039
 throwing the cream 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.310
 and we will mix everything 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.910
 well at this point we have it ready 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.310
 we put out the fire and ready to use without 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.210
 let it cool down we'll throw in the 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.210
 center a little 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.300
 and we will extend so that we fall 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.550
 by the sides once they have cooled 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.070
 we will make a syrup with water and 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.590
 sugar for it we will throw the sugar in 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.570
 the water and we will stir well with this the 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.630
 cotton candy will stick to us 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.790
 cupcake below we will join with 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.520
 very little syrup the surface of 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.040
 our cupcakes and then we will stick a 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.560
 little piece of cotton candy I advise you 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.750
 that if you are not going to consume the cake in 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.780
 the moment did not decorate the cupcakes 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.820
 because the cotton candy melts and 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.400
 when you go to present, you will see that 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.620
 nothing of cotton candy remains and as 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.560
 you see we already have our minicaster 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.200
 adorned last we'll finish off 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.900
 decorate our cake by putting the 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.320
 mini cupcakes over then we have 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.070
 our delicious chocolate sponge cake 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.960
