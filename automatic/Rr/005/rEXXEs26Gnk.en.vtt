00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
 Gold into the ball (TVB animation "Kick out my world" theme song) (2004) 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 Composer: Keiji lyrics: Gao Zhengzheng 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.200
 Lead singer: Zhou Guoxian 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 Selling tricks and writing in your diary 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.300
 I remember being a confidant that day. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.800
 I have tried to stand up before the end of the downturn. 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 Who is also for you, my wonderful footwork applause 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Together, I look forward to winning you all the way to cheer up. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040
 Who and I are desperate to stop 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.300
 Listening to my call, the audience is filled with cheers. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 Continue to go all out and fear that every opponent moves more exaggerated 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.300
 I am not afraid of falling injuries, I want to create my ideals with my legs. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.400
 No matter whether you step back or not, you don’t have to panic. 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 Just re-attacking and determined to work hard 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 Dealing with me intercepting me or breaking the net whistle 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 Extend my territory as much as possible in ninety minutes 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 Still holding the ball straight up, I will wear a pair of golden boots with you. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.300
 Please give me confidence to make energy 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.000
 If sweat is flowing into the audience 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Don’t shed tears this time. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.000
 I left a memorial in front of the dragon gate that day. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Looking back, you will break into each other's restricted area. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.300
 Today, the stadium is bright and there is always a day to catch up. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 Who can accompany you, who is afraid of the road 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.300
 The more the Vietnam War, the stronger the chapter opens a new chapter 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500
 Continue to go all out and fear that every opponent moves more exaggerated 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 I am not afraid of falling injuries, I want to create my ideals with my legs. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 No matter whether you step back or not, you don’t have to panic. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 Just re-attacking and determined to work hard 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.200
 When the sound is loud enough, each one also clap 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.360
 Today, the stadium is bright and there is always a day to catch up. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 Who can accompany you, who is afraid of the road 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.680
 The more the Vietnam War, the stronger the chapter opens a new chapter 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.500
 Continue to go all out and fear that every opponent moves more exaggerated 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 Don't be afraid of falling hurts, use your legs to create dreams and thoughts. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 No matter whether you step back or not, you don’t have to panic. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.800
 Just re-attacking and determined to work hard 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 Dealing with me intercepting me or breaking the net whistle 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.000
 Extend my territory as much as possible in ninety minutes 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Still holding the ball straight up, I will wear a pair of golden boots with you. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Please give me confidence to make energy 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 When the sound is loud enough, each one also clap
