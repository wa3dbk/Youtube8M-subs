00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.590 

what<00:01:06.770> am<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.070> gotta<00:01:07.730> be<00:01:07.820> like<00:01:07.940> mr.<00:01:08.150> Olympia

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.310 

three<00:01:13.600> bones<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.509> I<00:01:16.540> had<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.780> just<00:01:16.990> hang<00:01:17.140> up

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
three bones then I had to just hang up

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.480 
three bones then I had to just hang up
in<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.500> middle<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.770> his<00:01:17.830> girth<00:01:18.100> for<00:01:18.130> me<00:01:18.430> I

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
in the middle of his girth for me I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.590 
in the middle of his girth for me I
don't<00:01:18.640> know<00:01:18.700> what<00:01:18.820> he<00:01:18.880> was<00:01:19.000> talking<00:01:19.330> about<00:01:19.390> he

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
kept telling me how easy was the girth

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.219 
kept telling me how easy was the girth
is<00:01:21.850> actually<00:01:22.180> very<00:01:22.299> simple<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.780> figure<00:01:23.110> out

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
is actually very simple to figure out

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.420 
is actually very simple to figure out
all<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.439> do<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.710> take<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.040> length<00:01:24.220> and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
all you do is you take the length and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.620 
all you do is you take the length and
you<00:01:24.520> double<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:24.939> by<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.119> smaller<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
you double that by the smaller of the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.710 
you double that by the smaller of the
height<00:01:25.840> okay<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.229> gotta<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:26.530> get<00:01:26.860> another<00:01:27.009> call

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
height okay I gotta go get another call

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:38.310 
height okay I gotta go get another call
just<00:01:28.720> his<00:01:28.930> stupid<00:01:29.170> Adagio

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.649 

I<00:01:38.580> figured<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.640> would<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.880> call<00:01:40.060> back<00:01:40.240> you

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.710 
I figured I would just call back you
know<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.170> make<00:01:41.350> up<00:01:41.530> some<00:01:41.740> numbers

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
know and just make up some numbers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.850 
know and just make up some numbers
let<00:01:43.720> them<00:01:43.810> come<00:01:43.960> out<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.200> pick<00:01:44.380> them<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:44.620> if
