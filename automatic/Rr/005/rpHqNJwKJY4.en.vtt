you<00:01:00.120> talked<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.750> crunch<00:01:01.230> time<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:02.039> did

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you talked about crunch time what did

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
you talked about crunch time what did
you<00:01:02.250> learn<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.430> yourself<00:01:02.730> maybe<00:01:03.300> during

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you learn about yourself maybe during

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
you learn about yourself maybe during
that<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> takes<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that time and what it takes to have

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.230 
that time and what it takes to have
success<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.799> situation<00:01:08.220> yeah<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
success in that in that situation yeah I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.460 
success in that in that situation yeah I
think<00:01:09.510> more<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.689> anything<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.170> takes

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
think more than anything it just takes

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
think more than anything it just takes
good<00:01:10.710> preparation<00:01:11.310> good<00:01:11.490> attention<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
good preparation good attention to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
good preparation good attention to
detail<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.049> having<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.409> good

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
understanding of where guys are going to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
understanding of where guys are going to
be<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> need<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.130> the

incomplete<00:01:37.049> passes<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:39.090> than

incomplete passes is there one more than
the<00:01:39.329> others<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.990> you'd<00:01:40.140> look<00:01:40.380> look<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the others that you'd look look at the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.499 
the others that you'd look look at the
film<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> said<00:01:41.670> oh<00:01:41.820> man<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.060> should<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.329> gone

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
film and said oh man I should have gone

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
film and said oh man I should have gone
over<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.950> should<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.250> done<00:01:44.369> should

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
over there you should have done should

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.889 
over there you should have done should
have<00:01:44.729> done<00:01:44.850> something<00:01:44.880> different<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
have done something different on them I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
have done something different on them I
think<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.439> three<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.670> three

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
think all three just because all three

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.280 
think all three just because all three
of<00:01:47.939> them<00:01:48.119> probably<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.810> put<00:01:49.079> us<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of them probably could have put us in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.510 
of them probably could have put us in
field<00:01:49.470> goal<00:01:49.590> range<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.009> probably<00:01:50.220> would<00:01:50.399> have

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
field goal range and probably would have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
field goal range and probably would have
been<00:01:50.790> able<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.119> move<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> change<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.460> all

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
been able to move the change so all

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
been able to move the change so all
three<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> different<00:01:54.659> ways<00:01:54.780> frustrate<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
three in different ways frustrate you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.359 
three in different ways frustrate you
and<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.490> say<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> missed<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.189> key

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and make you say I missed it and the key

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.100 
and make you say I missed it and the key

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
now going forward is to learn from it

I've<00:03:09.810> said<00:03:09.959> through<00:03:10.169> training<00:03:10.620> camp<00:03:10.799> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I've said through training camp the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.800 
I've said through training camp the
changes<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.370> Jay<00:03:11.700> has<00:03:11.849> made<00:03:12.090> having<00:03:12.659> been

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
changes that Jay has made having been

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.240 
changes that Jay has made having been
for<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.079> better<00:03:13.109> they've<00:03:13.439> been<00:03:13.590> good<00:03:13.739> changes

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
for the better they've been good changes

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.830 
for the better they've been good changes
so<00:03:14.430> well<00:03:14.609> may<00:03:15.359> have<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.599> something<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
so well may have to do something a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.259 
so well may have to do something a
little<00:03:15.870> differently<00:03:16.290> or<00:03:16.439> make<00:03:16.560> an<00:03:16.680> adjustment

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
little differently or make an adjustment

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.849 
little differently or make an adjustment
you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.449> see<00:03:18.659> why<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.139> good<00:03:19.349> adjustment

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
you can see why it's a good adjustment

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.699 
you can see why it's a good adjustment
it's<00:03:19.979> going<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.159> make<00:03:20.310> us<00:03:20.430> better<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.930> know

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
it's going to make us better so you know

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.559 
it's going to make us better so you know
I'm<00:03:22.859> still<00:03:23.190> still<00:03:23.819> picking<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.209> every<00:03:24.449> week

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
I'm still still picking up every week

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.420 
I'm still still picking up every week
learning<00:03:24.989> what<00:03:25.319> he<00:03:25.440> wants<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:25.979> that'll

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
learning what he wants and that'll

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.119 
learning what he wants and that'll
continue<00:03:26.699> as<00:03:26.879> long<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.299> play<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.569> him<00:03:27.840> but

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
continue as long as I play for him but

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.379 
continue as long as I play for him but
the<00:03:29.129> longer<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.549> work<00:03:29.699> together<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.239> better

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
the longer we work together the better

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.240 
the longer we work together the better
we're<00:03:30.569> going<00:03:30.689> to<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.109> more<00:03:31.250> we're

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
we're going to get and the more we're

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:41.080 
we're going to get and the more we're
going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.430> find<00:03:32.579> ourselves<00:03:32.699> on<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> same<00:03:33.269> page

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.420 

I<00:03:42.320> think<00:03:43.320> when<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.500> look<00:03:43.530> at<00:03:43.770> protections<00:03:44.340> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
I think when you look at protections I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.470 
I think when you look at protections I
think<00:03:44.580> he<00:03:44.640> has<00:03:44.730> some<00:03:44.910> good<00:03:44.940> ideas<00:03:45.090> with

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
think he has some good ideas with

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.730 
think he has some good ideas with
protections<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:46.170> being<00:03:46.350> able<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.560> pick<00:03:46.710> up

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
protections and being able to pick up

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.220 
protections and being able to pick up
different<00:03:47.040> pressures<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.960> you<00:03:48.960> know<00:03:49.050> always

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
different pressures and you know always

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.530 
different pressures and you know always
give<00:03:49.440> yourself<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:49.770> chance<00:03:49.800> then<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:51.270> go<00:03:51.390> get

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
give yourself a chance then to go get

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050 
give yourself a chance then to go get
the<00:03:51.630> first<00:03:51.840> down<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.080> get<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.290> big<00:03:52.380> play<00:03:53.060> Kirk

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
the first down and get the big play Kirk

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.900 
the first down and get the big play Kirk
on<00:03:54.240> third<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.050> one<00:03:55.350> third<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.310> short<00:03:56.640> let's

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
on third and one third and short let's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.550 
on third and one third and short let's
call<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.600> seems<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.080> there's<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.440> little

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
call it it seems like there's a little

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.590 
call it it seems like there's a little
more<00:03:58.770> variety<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.340> terms<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.790> what<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.390> do

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
more variety in terms of what you can do

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.510 
more variety in terms of what you can do
and<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> guys<00:04:01.020> had<00:04:01.260> some<00:04:01.440> scope<00:04:01.740> success

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
and you guys had some scope success

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.740 
and you guys had some scope success
doing<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.000> couple<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.240> different<00:04:03.510> ways<00:04:03.540> on

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
doing it a couple of different ways on

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.140 
doing it a couple of different ways on
Sundays<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.320> there<00:04:04.830> more<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.790> scheme

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
Sundays is there more in this scheme

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.080 
Sundays is there more in this scheme
than<00:04:06.450> maybe<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.440> previous<00:04:07.910> scheme<00:04:08.910> on

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
than maybe in the previous scheme on

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940 
than maybe in the previous scheme on
third<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.630> one<00:04:09.690> third<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.320> short<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:10.890> you

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
third and one third and short for you

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.470 
third and one third and short for you
guys<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.610> be<00:04:12.000> less<00:04:12.180> predictable

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
guys to have and be less predictable

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.870 
guys to have and be less predictable
yeah<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.410> understand<00:04:14.130> your<00:04:14.250> point<00:04:14.430> there<00:04:14.640> Chris

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
yeah I understand your point there Chris

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.340 
yeah I understand your point there Chris
I'd<00:04:15.090> say<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.300> know<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.690> only<00:04:15.810> been<00:04:15.930> three

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
I'd say you know it's only been three

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.590 
I'd say you know it's only been three
weeks<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.829> it's<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.640> know<00:04:17.730> it's<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.269> lot<00:04:18.359> of

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
weeks so it's you know it's not a lot of

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.930 
weeks so it's you know it's not a lot of
bodywork<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.320> able<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.620> say<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.190> know<00:04:20.220> if

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
bodywork to be able to say you know if

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
bodywork to be able to say you know if
we're<00:04:21.180> more<00:04:21.419> variable<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.410> third<00:04:22.680> down<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
we're more variable on third down and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.680 
we're more variable on third down and
short<00:04:23.160> than<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.730> were<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.030> past<00:04:24.210> i<00:04:24.480> think

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
short than we were in the past i think

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.620 
short than we were in the past i think
that<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.650> know<00:04:26.520> jay<00:04:26.790> is<00:04:26.940> an<00:04:27.090> outstanding<00:04:27.360> play

show itself in having a lot of variety
on<00:04:37.890> third-and-short<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.900> know<00:04:39.990> at<00:04:40.050> the

same time a lot of teams who are very

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.220 
same time a lot of teams who are very
vanilla<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:42.030> third<00:04:42.240> down<00:04:42.450> if<00:04:42.660> they<00:04:42.780> if<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:42.960> can
