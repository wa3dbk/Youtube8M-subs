hi<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.560> video<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.890> about<00:00:02.010> section<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.850> solids

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi this video is about section of solids

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.809 
hi this video is about section of solids
in<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.350> video<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.980> called<00:00:05.220> Pentagon

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
in this video I have called Pentagon

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.120 
in this video I have called Pentagon
pyramid<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> problem<00:00:07.890> statement

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
pyramid so this is the problem statement

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.360 
pyramid so this is the problem statement
here<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.880> pentagonal<00:00:09.809> pyramid<00:00:10.230> off<00:00:10.710> side<00:00:11.190> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
here a pentagonal pyramid off side of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.440 
here a pentagonal pyramid off side of
base<00:00:11.580> 20<00:00:12.030> mm<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.389> height<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.990> X<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.410> 50<00:00:13.920> mm<00:00:14.040> is

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
base 20 mm and height of X is 50 mm is

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.349 
base 20 mm and height of X is 50 mm is
resting<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.570> base<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.640> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> key<00:00:18.119> here

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
resting on base so this is a key here

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.040 
resting on base so this is a key here
base<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.050> such<00:00:19.380> such<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.600> one<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> size

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
base in such such a way that one of size

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
on axis from based on draw the front

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.080 
on axis from based on draw the front
view<00:00:39.000> section<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.379> okay<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
view section on top you okay so if you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.680 
view section on top you okay so if you
try<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> visualize<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.860> position<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> AB

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
try to visualize the position of AB

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.729 
try to visualize the position of AB
Pentagon<00:00:45.690> pyramid<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.289> look<00:00:46.559> something

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
Pentagon pyramid would look something

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
Pentagon pyramid would look something
like<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> sitting<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> base<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
like this so it is sitting on a base is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.860 
like this so it is sitting on a base is
sitting<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> horizontal<00:00:50.340> plane<00:00:50.670> okay<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
sitting on a horizontal plane okay and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
sitting on a horizontal plane okay and
this<00:00:52.260> side<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:53.250> let<00:00:53.910> me<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.410> side<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this side here let me this side here it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
this side here let me this side here it
is<00:00:56.789> perpendicular<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> vertical<00:00:58.050> plane

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is perpendicular to the vertical plane

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
is perpendicular to the vertical plane
so<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.730> end<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.750> axis<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.840> parallel<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so this end is axis it is parallel to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.780 
so this end is axis it is parallel to
vertical<00:01:04.500> plane<00:01:04.769> case<00:01:05.580> basis<00:01:06.650> perpendicular

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
vertical plane case basis perpendicular

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.750 
vertical plane case basis perpendicular
axis<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.000> parallel<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.500> ticket<00:01:10.799> plane<00:01:11.010> so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
axis is parallel to what ticket plane so

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.590 
axis is parallel to what ticket plane so
if<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:13.010> draw<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> front<00:01:14.520> view<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> top<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
if you draw the front view and top you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
if you draw the front view and top you
this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> looked<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is what it looked like so this is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
this is what it looked like so this is
the<00:01:18.360> top<00:01:18.600> view<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> front<00:01:20.430> view

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the top view here this is the front view

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.969 
the top view here this is the front view
so<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> first<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so that is the first thing we have to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.140 
so that is the first thing we have to
draw<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.750> second<00:01:24.750> thing<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> cut<00:01:25.830> by<00:01:26.250> plane

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
draw a second thing it is cut by plane

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.740 
draw a second thing it is cut by plane
in<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.320> such<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> way<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> makes<00:01:29.729> 45<00:01:30.360> degree

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
in a such a way that it makes 45 degree

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
in a such a way that it makes 45 degree
so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> red<00:01:31.770> line<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.280> making<00:01:32.790> 45<00:01:33.360> degree

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so this red line is making 45 degree

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
so this red line is making 45 degree
with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> horizontal<00:01:34.229> plane<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with the horizontal plane here that is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
with the horizontal plane here that is
XY<00:01:36.390> axis<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.869> 25<00:01:40.740> mm<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
XY axis this one and it is 25 mm to the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.620 
XY axis this one and it is 25 mm to the
axis<00:01:41.850> okay<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.930> line<00:01:43.460> from<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
axis okay so this line from here it is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.310 
axis okay so this line from here it is
high<00:01:46.320> res<00:01:46.560> 25<00:01:47.189> mm<00:01:47.399> okay<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.090> let<00:01:48.479> me<00:01:48.659> zoom<00:01:48.689> in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
high res 25 mm okay so let me zoom in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.929 
high res 25 mm okay so let me zoom in
and<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.770> draw<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> section<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.259> am<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
and to draw the section I am going to

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.480 
and to draw the section I am going to
make<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.149> 150<00:01:54.810> percent<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> draw<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
make it 150 percent so to draw the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.429 
make it 150 percent so to draw the
section<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.640> am<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.390> extend<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.140> line

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
section I am going to extend this line

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
section I am going to extend this line
over<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.969> it<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:04.430> intersect<00:02:05.479> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
over here it is going to intersect this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.490 
over here it is going to intersect this
two<00:02:06.750> line<00:02:08.209> second<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.989> touching

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
two line second thing it is touching

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.640 
two line second thing it is touching
these<00:02:12.100> two<00:02:12.400> side<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:13.990> am<00:02:14.020> exceeding

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
these two side here so I am exceeding

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.460 
these two side here so I am exceeding
that<00:02:15.430> line<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.320> third<00:02:17.620> line<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.100> here

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that line here in the third line is here

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.680 
that line here in the third line is here
okay<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.530> once<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.220> exchanged<00:02:21.880> those<00:02:22.060> lines<00:02:22.420> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
okay so once I exchanged those lines I
