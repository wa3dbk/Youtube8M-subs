00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
just a little too chewy it made it about

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
just a little too chewy it made it about
eight<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.239> ten<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.809> minutes<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
eight or ten more minutes to go now I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.270 
eight or ten more minutes to go now I
had<00:01:02.460> set<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.760> timer<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.870> 30<00:01:04.409> minutes<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.129> make

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
had set my timer for 30 minutes to make

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.050 
had set my timer for 30 minutes to make
to<00:01:05.850> boil<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.560> brown<00:01:07.560> rice<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.549> still

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to boil the brown rice but it still

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
to boil the brown rice but it still
wasn't<00:01:09.270> enough<00:01:09.450> time<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.140> guess<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> was

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
wasn't enough time and I guess it was

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
wasn't enough time and I guess it was
because<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.890> such<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> large<00:01:11.340> quantity<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> rice

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
because of such a large quantity of rice

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109 
because of such a large quantity of rice
I<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.979> anyways<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:14.939> how

every<00:01:17.790> pan<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:19.130> anyway<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.820> with

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
