here's one thing that's important you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
here's one thing that's important you
want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.390> where<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.290> light<00:01:46.590> source

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
want to know where is your light source

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.210 
want to know where is your light source
coming<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> suggest<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
coming from so I'm going to suggest that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
coming from so I'm going to suggest that
the<00:01:50.490> light<00:01:50.670> source<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.390> coming<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.899> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the light source is coming from this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.179 
the light source is coming from this
angle<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.939> sometimes<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.180> even<00:01:55.040> just<00:01:56.040> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
angle so sometimes you can even just so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.410 
angle so sometimes you can even just so
you<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.310> forget<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.219> create<00:01:59.909> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you don't forget you can create just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.709 
you don't forget you can create just
