00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.240 
is so much of an issue to be quite
honest<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.080> we<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.440> all<00:03:28.620> afford

honest I think that we can all afford
organic<00:03:30.120> clothes<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.320> we<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:32.330> don't<00:03:33.330> buy<00:03:33.540> so

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
organic clothes if we just don't buy so

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.170

much<00:03:34.080> clothes<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.040> also<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.030> buy

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
much clothes and also when you buy

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.699 
much clothes and also when you buy
higher-quality<00:03:36.660> things<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.290> don't<00:03:37.470> need<00:03:37.620> to
