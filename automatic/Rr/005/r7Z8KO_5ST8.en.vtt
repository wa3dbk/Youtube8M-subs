00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.870 

let's<00:01:45.090> say<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> two<00:01:45.600> channel<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.610> wings

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
let's say it's a two channel the wings

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
let's say it's a two channel the wings
the<00:01:48.210> battery<00:01:48.630> fits<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> slot<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the battery fits in the slot here the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
the battery fits in the slot here the
wings<00:01:49.979> go<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.549> rubber<00:01:50.759> bands<00:01:51.229> first

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
wings go on with rubber bands first

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
wings go on with rubber bands first
thing<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.439> noticed<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.100> wing<00:01:53.340> cap<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
thing I noticed is this wing cap when it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
thing I noticed is this wing cap when it
goes<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.020> supposed<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.909> hit<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
goes over your supposed to hit the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.139 
goes over your supposed to hit the
rubber<00:01:57.180> bands<00:01:57.750> across<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.399> side<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
rubber bands across and then side to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
rubber bands across and then side to
side<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.439> little<00:02:01.649> tabs<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.310> short

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
side but these little tabs are so short

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.569 
side but these little tabs are so short
that<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:04.530> hard<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> hook<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that it is really hard to hook on the

it's<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.659> say<00:02:52.840> my<00:02:52.989> line<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.200> thinking<00:02:53.319> was

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
it's like say my line of thinking was

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.030 
it's like say my line of thinking was
practiced<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.370> an<00:02:54.489> indoor<00:02:54.790> plane<00:02:56.040> get

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
practiced with an indoor plane get

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.780

outdoors with a two-channel get used to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.949 
outdoors with a two-channel get used to
staring<00:03:01.060> you're<00:03:01.359> playing<00:03:01.569> with<00:03:01.659> a<00:03:01.720> rudder

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959

that<00:03:02.769> kind<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.010> deal<00:03:03.159> but<00:03:03.280> there's<00:03:03.430> no

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
that kind of deal but there's no

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.460 
that kind of deal but there's no
elevation<00:03:04.000> control<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> two-channel<00:03:05.260> plane

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
elevation control on a two-channel plane

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.890 
elevation control on a two-channel plane
and<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.489> knew<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:06.879> so<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.150> wanted<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.540> step<00:03:07.780> it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and I knew that so I wanted to step it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.740 
and I knew that so I wanted to step it
up<00:03:07.959> again<00:03:08.290> hmm<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.120> got<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.299> three-channel

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
up again hmm and I got a three-channel

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.869 
up again hmm and I got a three-channel
glider<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.560> was<00:03:12.129> thinking<00:03:12.250> once<00:03:12.579> I<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
glider I was thinking once I get the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.050 
glider I was thinking once I get the
hang<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> two-channel<00:03:13.840> deal<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:15.400> had

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
hang of the two-channel deal I had

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.000 
hang of the two-channel deal I had
another<00:03:16.269> channel<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.500> I'll<00:03:17.620> do<00:03:17.739> first

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
another channel and what I'll do first

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.270 
another channel and what I'll do first
is<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.370> for<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.609> glider<00:03:18.819> so<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:20.099> go<00:03:21.099> ahead<00:03:21.160> and

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
is go for a glider so I can go ahead and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.830 
is go for a glider so I can go ahead and
get<00:03:21.400> me<00:03:21.519> some<00:03:21.669> altitude<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.389> just<00:03:22.569> do<00:03:22.660> some

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
get me some altitude and just do some

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.509 
get me some altitude and just do some
lazy<00:03:23.109> type<00:03:23.440> flying<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:24.190> little<00:03:24.790> bit<00:03:24.879> slower<00:03:26.519> the

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
lazy type flying a little bit slower the

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.780 
lazy type flying a little bit slower the
propeller<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.419> plane<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.790> exhibit

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
propeller on this plane it's the exhibit

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
propeller on this plane it's the exhibit
is<00:03:30.910> bad<00:03:31.209> eous<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:32.379> propeller<00:03:32.769> drops<00:03:33.069> back

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
is bad eous the propeller drops back

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.770 
is bad eous the propeller drops back
when<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:35.859> spinning<00:03:36.569> so<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
when it's not spinning so you can just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.140 
when it's not spinning so you can just
cut<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.079> motor<00:03:38.260> off<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.590> glide<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.129> so<00:03:40.120> that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
cut the motor off and glide and so that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.199 
cut the motor off and glide and so that
gives<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.599> more<00:03:40.780> flight<00:03:41.019> time<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:42.220> problem<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
gives you more flight time a problem is

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.240 
gives you more flight time a problem is
it's<00:03:44.109> plastic<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.780> I'm<00:03:47.109> thinking<00:03:47.139> if<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.889> crash

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
it's plastic so I'm thinking if I crash

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.659 
it's plastic so I'm thinking if I crash
this<00:03:49.319> there<00:03:50.319> will<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.709> any<00:03:50.889> easy<00:03:51.250> fixes

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
this there will not be any easy fixes

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.390 
this there will not be any easy fixes

another<00:04:13.540> time<00:04:14.699> before<00:04:15.699> i<00:04:15.760> go<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:15.909> four

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
another time before i go to four

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.240 
another time before i go to four
channels<00:04:16.570> wanted<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.919> something<00:04:18.130> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
channels wanted to have something a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.509 
channels wanted to have something a
little<00:04:18.400> bit<00:04:18.549> faster<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:19.120> little<00:04:19.209> bit<00:04:19.419> smaller

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
little bit faster a little bit smaller

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.409 
little bit faster a little bit smaller
hoping<00:04:21.519> for<00:04:21.549> maybe<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:22.000> little<00:04:22.120> bit<00:04:22.270> more

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
hoping for maybe a little bit more

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.240 
hoping for maybe a little bit more
maneuverability<00:04:23.400> again<00:04:24.400> I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
maneuverability again I

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.170 
maneuverability again I

it<00:04:33.410> just<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:36.550> l'heure<00:04:37.550> ons<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.970> think<00:04:38.240> would<00:04:38.390> just

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
it just a l'heure ons I think would just

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.200 
it just a l'heure ons I think would just
be<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.290> lot<00:04:39.830> better<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.190> use<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:41.120> was

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
be a lot better to use there was

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.310 
be a lot better to use there was
something<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.420> wanted<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.690> say<00:04:41.810> about<00:04:42.050> this

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
something I wanted to say about this

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.650 
something I wanted to say about this
plane<00:04:42.680> right<00:04:42.890> here<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.400> we'll<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:44.420> come

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
plane right here and we'll just come

plane right here and we'll just come
back<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.670> problem<00:04:46.670> I<00:04:46.760> had<00:04:46.970> first<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.420> you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
back to it problem I had first of you

back to it problem I had first of you
problem<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.530> had<00:04:49.090> with<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.270> indoor<00:04:50.630> flyer

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
problem I had with this indoor flyer

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.200 
problem I had with this indoor flyer
right<00:04:52.040> when<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.310> came<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.700> me<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:52.880> open<00:04:53.090> up<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
right when it came to me and open up the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.420 
right when it came to me and open up the
box<00:04:53.540> this<00:04:54.350> little<00:04:54.620> piece<00:04:54.830> here<00:04:54.860> was

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
box this little piece here was

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.570 
box this little piece here was
separating<00:04:56.030> from<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> wing<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.950> stabbed<00:04:58.460> a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
separating from the wing so I stabbed a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.540 
separating from the wing so I stabbed a
toothpick<00:04:59.090> down<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.169> there<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.740> kind<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.370> snap

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
toothpick down in there to kind of snap

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.120 
toothpick down in there to kind of snap
this<00:05:01.700> stuff<00:05:01.910> back<00:05:02.060> together<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:03.919> don't

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
this stuff back together and I don't

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.680 
this stuff back together and I don't
know<00:05:04.250> how<00:05:04.430> well<00:05:04.640> we<00:05:04.760> can<00:05:04.880> see<00:05:05.120> right<00:05:05.360> here<00:05:05.510> but

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
know how well we can see right here but

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.480 
know how well we can see right here but
this<00:05:05.810> wing<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.020> off<00:05:06.350> centered<00:05:06.830> came<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.370> way

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
this wing is off centered came that way

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.990 
this wing is off centered came that way
from<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.760> factory<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.140> wing<00:05:09.350> alignment

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
from the factory so the wing alignment

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.159 
from the factory so the wing alignment
back<00:05:11.000> up<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.300> little<00:05:11.390> bit<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.720> can<00:05:11.810> see<00:05:11.990> how<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
back up a little bit you can see how the

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.990 
back up a little bit you can see how the
wings<00:05:12.410> come<00:05:13.070> real<00:05:13.340> close<00:05:13.490> together<00:05:13.700> up<00:05:13.970> here

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
wings come real close together up here

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.150 
wings come real close together up here
and<00:05:14.390> they<00:05:14.960> got<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.110> different<00:05:15.470> spacing<00:05:15.860> up<00:05:15.950> here

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
and they got a different spacing up here

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.670 
and they got a different spacing up here
they're<00:05:16.310> better<00:05:16.460> staggered<00:05:16.970> well<00:05:17.720> since<00:05:18.560> the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
they're better staggered well since the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.530 
they're better staggered well since the
motors<00:05:19.010> are<00:05:19.340> your<00:05:19.520> driving<00:05:19.850> force<00:05:20.090> as<00:05:20.270> far<00:05:20.450> as

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
motors are your driving force as far as

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.870 
motors are your driving force as far as
turning<00:05:20.810> your<00:05:21.800> plane<00:05:21.980> is<00:05:22.010> constantly<00:05:22.640> wanting

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
turning your plane is constantly wanting

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.630 
turning your plane is constantly wanting
to<00:05:22.970> turn<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.570> left<00:05:23.720> so<00:05:24.430> you're<00:05:25.430> always

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
to turn to the left so you're always

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.370 
to turn to the left so you're always
always<00:05:25.940> always<00:05:26.180> always<00:05:26.450> adjusting<00:05:27.290> this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
always always always adjusting this

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.690 
always always always adjusting this
freaking<00:05:27.740> thing<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:28.790> high<00:05:28.970> speed<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.419> this<00:05:30.700> is

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
freaking thing the high speed of this is

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.870 
freaking thing the high speed of this is
supposed<00:05:32.419> to<00:05:32.540> be<00:05:32.600> for<00:05:33.530> altitude<00:05:33.860> gaining<00:05:34.729> and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
supposed to be for altitude gaining and

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.390 
supposed to be for altitude gaining and
then<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.510> drop<00:05:35.750> back<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.680> hold<00:05:36.890> down<00:05:37.040> for

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
then you drop back and you hold down for

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.920 
then you drop back and you hold down for
like<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.760> there's<00:05:38.000> more<00:05:38.210> moderate<00:05:38.630> speed

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
like this there's more moderate speed

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.200 
like this there's more moderate speed
control<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:40.729> is<00:05:40.910> supposed<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.300> give<00:05:41.510> you

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
control and that is supposed to give you

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.670 
control and that is supposed to give you
regular<00:05:44.210> flight<00:05:44.510> but<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.840> motor<00:05:45.020> is<00:05:45.200> just<00:05:45.530> not

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
regular flight but the motor is just not

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.159 
regular flight but the motor is just not
powerful<00:05:45.890> enough<00:05:46.310> if<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.450> try<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.840> drop<00:05:48.020> this

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
powerful enough if you try to drop this

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.230 
powerful enough if you try to drop this
thing<00:05:48.229> back<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.590> just<00:05:48.890> cruise<00:05:49.100> it<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:50.090> is

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
thing back and just cruise it this is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.930 
thing back and just cruise it this is
basically<00:05:50.600> your<00:05:50.870> landing<00:05:51.370> landing<00:05:52.370> speed<00:05:52.760> it

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
basically your landing landing speed it

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.659 
basically your landing landing speed it
says<00:05:53.120> it's<00:05:53.270> your<00:05:53.390> cruising<00:05:53.720> speed<00:05:53.990> that's<00:05:54.260> BS

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
says it's your cruising speed that's BS

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.469 
says it's your cruising speed that's BS
you'll<00:05:55.669> hit<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.940> ground<00:05:58.060> another<00:05:59.060> problem<00:05:59.210> I

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
you'll hit the ground another problem I

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.350 
you'll hit the ground another problem I
had<00:05:59.690> was<00:05:59.960> about<00:06:00.380> ten<00:06:00.620> minutes<00:06:00.710> after<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.700> flew

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
had was about ten minutes after I flew

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.260 
had was about ten minutes after I flew
it<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.860> started<00:06:04.280> jumping<00:06:04.610> out<00:06:04.729> it<00:06:04.880> says<00:06:05.060> that

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
it it started jumping out it says that

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.830 
it it started jumping out it says that
this<00:06:05.419> works<00:06:05.720> up<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:05.960> 150<00:06:06.890> feet<00:06:07.240> but<00:06:08.240> I<00:06:08.479> found

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
this works up to 150 feet but I found

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.300 
this works up to 150 feet but I found
that<00:06:08.990> if<00:06:09.140> this<00:06:09.290> thing<00:06:09.470> gets<00:06:09.620> more<00:06:09.860> than<00:06:09.979> five

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
that if this thing gets more than five
