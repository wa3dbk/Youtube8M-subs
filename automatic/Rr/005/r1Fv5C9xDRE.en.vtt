00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.920 
on there in the chisel ed when you put
it<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.680> goes<00:02:04.920> sideways<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:09.570> that's<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:11.930> if

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it it goes sideways in and that's it if

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.360 
it it goes sideways in and that's it if
you<00:02:13.140> want<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.500> ink<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.770> get<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> other<00:02:14.250> end

I imagine you can always just tip it a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.720 
I imagine you can always just tip it a
little<00:02:16.770> bit<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.460> let<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.430> got<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
little bit to let it go but now I got a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.730 
little bit to let it go but now I got a
juicy<00:02:20.970> marker<00:02:21.510> again<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.440> very
