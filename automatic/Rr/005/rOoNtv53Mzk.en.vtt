00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
as I can about the material and that's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
as I can about the material and that's
what<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> dramatist<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> remind

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
what a dramatist does I have to remind

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
what a dramatist does I have to remind
you<00:01:14.430> perhaps<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.000> dramatists<00:01:15.659> existed

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you perhaps that dramatists existed

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.469 
you perhaps that dramatists existed
before<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> historians<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.490> Greece<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
before the historians in Greece the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
before the historians in Greece the
ancient<00:01:19.350> theatre<00:01:19.740> Sophocles<00:01:20.640> Aeschylus

ancient theatre Sophocles Aeschylus
Euripides<00:01:21.650> were<00:01:22.650> writing<00:01:23.070> before<00:01:23.340> Herodotus

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Euripides were writing before Herodotus

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.380 
Euripides were writing before Herodotus
and<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.080> historians<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> remember

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and the other historians so remember

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.560 
and the other historians so remember
that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
that
I<00:01:27.720> mean<00:01:27.900> drama<00:01:28.530> has<00:01:28.799> always<00:01:29.009> inner<00:01:29.400> woven<00:01:29.790> with

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I mean drama has always inner woven with

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510 
I mean drama has always inner woven with
history<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.630> often<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> given<00:01:32.369> us

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
history and I think often is given us

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.600 
history and I think often is given us
insights<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.450> history<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.650> written<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
insights that history if written in a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.920 
insights that history if written in a
certain<00:01:35.759> way<00:01:36.030> cannot<00:01:36.390> give<00:01:36.570> us<00:01:36.689> certain

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
certain way cannot give us certain

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
certain way cannot give us certain
historians<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> facts<00:01:38.070> together<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
historians can put the facts together a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.890 
historians can put the facts together a
certain<00:01:38.820> way<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.329> always<00:01:39.600> leave<00:01:39.750> out

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

other facts they do their own form of
cherry-picking<00:01:42.720> -<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.250> every

cherry-picking - and you know every

so forth and so on we know that because

was a very good discipline first and we

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.159 
was a very good discipline first and we
used<00:03:01.169> theatrical<00:03:02.389> conceits<00:03:03.389> throughout<00:03:03.870> the
