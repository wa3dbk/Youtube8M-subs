00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to talk about more realistic mods that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.450 
to talk about more realistic mods that
could<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.450> introduced<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.799> check<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
could be introduced now check out this

could be introduced now check out this
image<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> first<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
image here this is the first one that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
image here this is the first one that
Sharkboy<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.340> send<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> me<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
Sharkboy did send to me and as you can

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.469 
Sharkboy did send to me and as you can
see<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> top<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:05.100> has<00:02:05.340> introduced<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
see on the top right he has introduced a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
see on the top right he has introduced a
mini<00:02:06.840> map<00:02:07.110> mod<00:02:07.350> he's<00:02:07.530> also<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
mini map mod he's also got the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
mini map mod he's also got the
coordinates<00:02:08.399> which<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> talk<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
coordinates which I want to talk more in

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.260 
coordinates which I want to talk more in
detail<00:02:10.080> about<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.610> would<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:11.940> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
detail about because this would be so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.740 
detail about because this would be so
useful<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.959> Minecraft

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
useful for Minecraft

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.390 
useful for Minecraft
so<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> reason<00:02:14.350> why<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.800> saying<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
so I'm the reason why I'm saying that is

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.130 
so I'm the reason why I'm saying that is
because<00:02:15.430> if<00:02:15.910> you're<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.240> me<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.750> you're

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
world the only way to explore different

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.690 
world the only way to explore different
areas<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.810> map<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.290> by<00:02:26.860> taking<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.490> whole

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
areas of the map is by taking a whole

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
areas of the map is by taking a whole
bunch<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.120> maps<00:02:28.480> with<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.140> which<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.980> know

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
bunch of maps with you which as you know

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.430 
bunch of maps with you which as you know
if<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.940> explore<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.780> takes<00:02:32.230> up

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
if you are going to explore it takes up

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140 
if you are going to explore it takes up
a<00:02:32.530> whole<00:02:32.710> bunch<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.160> space<00:02:33.490> which<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.760> really

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
a whole bunch of space which you really

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.880 
a whole bunch of space which you really
don't<00:02:34.390> want<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.780> do<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.320> mini-map<00:02:35.680> would

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
don't want to do so the mini-map would

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.530 
don't want to do so the mini-map would
show<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.400> indication<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:37.210> where<00:02:37.360> you're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
show you the indication on where you're

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.600 
show you the indication on where you're
at<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:38.140> could<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> coordinates<00:02:39.250> which

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
at you could have the coordinates which

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.700 
at you could have the coordinates which
will<00:02:39.790> say<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.180> don't<00:02:40.360> know<00:02:40.420> X<00:02:40.690> Y<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.200> Zed<00:02:41.380> walk

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
will say I don't know X Y and Zed walk

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.010 
will say I don't know X Y and Zed walk
coordinates<00:02:42.190> your<00:02:42.280> R<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.790> no<00:02:43.660> doubt<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
coordinates your R and no doubt you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.420 
coordinates your R and no doubt you
would<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.200> saved<00:02:44.410> your<00:02:44.560> coordinates<00:02:45.010> for

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
would have saved your coordinates for

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.040 
would have saved your coordinates for
your<00:02:45.640> home<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.209> think<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.750> definitely

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
your home so I think this is definitely

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320 
your home so I think this is definitely
something<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.830> could<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.610> possibly<00:02:48.970> shouldn't

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
something I could and possibly shouldn't

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.970 
something I could and possibly shouldn't
be<00:02:49.420> introduced<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.020> minecraft<00:02:50.500> console<00:02:50.890> I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
be introduced to minecraft console I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.710 
be introduced to minecraft console I
know<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.250> easier<00:02:51.670> said<00:02:51.970> than<00:02:52.120> done<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.630> I

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
know it's easier said than done and I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.880 
know it's easier said than done and I
don't<00:02:52.930> know<00:02:53.050> what<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.470> show<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.770> all

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
don't know what for show is all

don't know what for show is all
Microsoft<00:02:54.610> are<00:02:54.760> doing<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.330> moment<00:02:55.480> I

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
Microsoft are doing at the moment I

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.970 
Microsoft are doing at the moment I
really<00:02:56.110> don't<00:02:56.380> know<00:02:56.500> what<00:02:56.650> they're<00:02:56.830> doing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
really don't know what they're doing

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.590 
really don't know what they're doing
because<00:02:57.550> they<00:02:57.850> haven't<00:02:58.030> give<00:02:58.240> us<00:02:58.360> any

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
because they haven't give us any

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.360 
because they haven't give us any
information<00:02:59.260> at<00:02:59.410> all<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.890> let<00:03:00.040> me<00:03:00.100> know<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.340> the

think<00:03:02.530> about<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> mini-map<00:03:03.310> mod<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.760> think

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
think about the mini-map mod I think

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.280 
think about the mini-map mod I think
this<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.209> something<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.600> realistically

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
this is something that realistically

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.440 
this is something that realistically
could<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.620> introduced<00:03:06.220> because<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.330> way

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
could be introduced because of the way

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.510 
could be introduced because of the way
the<00:03:07.600> map<00:03:07.810> system<00:03:08.260> works<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.740> minecraft

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
the map system works on minecraft

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.000
