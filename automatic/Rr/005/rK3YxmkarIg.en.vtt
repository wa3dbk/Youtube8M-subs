00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and was actually one of our servers in

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
and was actually one of our servers in
the<00:00:38.040> department<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> no<00:00:39.300> longer<00:00:39.480> needed

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
the department that is no longer needed
of<00:00:40.440> course<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.920> used<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
of course or used this is the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.639 
of course or used this is the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
motherboard and one very important chip

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
motherboard and one very important chip
on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> motherboard<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> CPU<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on the motherboard is the CPU this is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.330 
on the motherboard is the CPU this is
the<00:01:11.640> CPU<00:01:12.140> CPU<00:01:13.140> stands<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.979> central

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the CPU CPU stands for central

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
the CPU CPU stands for central
processing<00:01:14.909> unit<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> brain<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
processing unit and it's the brain of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.030 
processing unit and it's the brain of
the<00:01:16.500> computer

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the computer

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
the computer
it's<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.850> execute<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> programs<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it's what execute the programs that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's what execute the programs that
programmers<00:01:20.220> write<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> computer

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
programmers write so this computer

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
programmers write so this computer
happens<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.759> an<00:01:23.909> Intel<00:01:24.360> chip<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
happens to have an Intel chip on it and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
happens to have an Intel chip on it and
I<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:25.680> remove<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I can actually remove this and take a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.069 
I can actually remove this and take a
look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
look at it here and I'm going to do that

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
look at it here and I'm going to do that
so<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> contact

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so there is the there are the contact

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
so there is the there are the contact
pins<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.100> CPU<00:01:35.900> that's<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> CPU

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
pins for the CPU that's how the CPU

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.310 
pins for the CPU that's how the CPU
talks<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> motherboard<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
talks to the motherboard and in the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
talks to the motherboard and in the
middle<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.310> CPU<00:01:41.670> chip<00:01:42.030> itself<00:01:42.420> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
middle of it is the CPU chip itself it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.219 
middle of it is the CPU chip itself it's
a<00:01:42.810> pentium<00:01:43.290> MMX<00:01:44.570> processor<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.899> happen

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
a pentium MMX processor that we happen

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
a pentium MMX processor that we happen
to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.409> looking<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.299> processors

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to be looking at here so the processors

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
to be looking at here so the processors
of<00:01:49.290> course<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.189> much<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.729> complex<00:01:51.210> today

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
of course are much more complex today

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.310 
of course are much more complex today
they<00:01:52.320> generally<00:01:52.920> come<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.659> enclosed<00:01:54.659> units<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they generally come in enclosed units so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.429 
they generally come in enclosed units so
you<00:01:55.380> can't<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> chip<00:01:56.399> itself<00:01:57.200> but<00:01:58.200> we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you can't look at the chip itself but we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
you can't look at the chip itself but we
can<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> contact

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
can on this one so there are the contact

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.490 
can on this one so there are the contact
pins<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.560> CPU<00:02:02.549> chip<00:02:02.880> itself<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:04.049> seats

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
pins and the CPU chip itself that seats

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.900 
pins and the CPU chip itself that seats
in<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.920> socket<00:02:05.520> seven<00:02:07.369> chakra<00:02:08.369> tier<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
in a socket seven chakra tier on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.839 
in a socket seven chakra tier on the
motherboard<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.660> clips<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
motherboard and clips right in so it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.620 
motherboard and clips right in so it
doesn't<00:02:11.879> fall<00:02:12.360> out

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
doesn't fall out

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.380 
doesn't fall out
and<00:02:13.720> again<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.740> CPU<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.850> brain<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and again the CPU is the brain of the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
and again the CPU is the brain of the
computer<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.320> responsible<00:02:17.980> for

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
computer and it is responsible for

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.140 
computer and it is responsible for
adding<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.690> subtracting<00:02:20.170> numbers<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.910> can

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
adding and subtracting numbers it can

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360 
adding and subtracting numbers it can
compare<00:02:22.720> two<00:02:22.960> numbers<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.590> see<00:02:23.800> which<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.220> is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
compare two numbers to see which one is

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.560 
compare two numbers to see which one is
bigger<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:27.040> move<00:02:27.520> data<00:02:27.880> around<00:02:28.060> in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
bigger and it can move data around in

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.120 
bigger and it can move data around in
memory<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.230> hard<00:02:32.440> drive<00:02:32.710> which<00:02:32.950> we'll

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.770 
memory and to the hard drive which we'll
be<00:02:33.250> looking<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.180> little<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
be looking at here in a little bit and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.950 
be looking at here in a little bit and
other<00:02:35.590> i/o<00:02:35.860> devices<00:02:36.630> input/output<00:02:37.630> devices

other i/o devices input/output devices
so<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.580> use<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.940> brain<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:41.710> is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so see if you use the brain and it is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.710 
so see if you use the brain and it is
very<00:02:42.040> limited<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.640> its<00:02:42.730> capabilities<00:02:43.000> it

can't do very much other than move data
around<00:02:45.820> compare<00:02:46.390> numbers<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.990> do<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> little

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
around compare numbers and do a little

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.560 
around compare numbers and do a little
math<00:02:47.680> for<00:02:48.040> us<00:02:49.740> next<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> CPU<00:02:51.640> here<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.270> the

to go through a whole list or anything

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.110 
to go through a whole list or anything
like<00:04:05.440> that

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
like that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.400 
like that
that's<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.330> RAM<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.960> computer<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.870> RAM

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
that's the RAM of the computer the RAM

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.530 
that's the RAM of the computer the RAM
the<00:04:11.890> problem<00:04:12.490> with<00:04:12.670> RAM<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.360> when<00:04:13.450> you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
the problem with RAM is that when you

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.750 
the problem with RAM is that when you
turn<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.960> computer<00:04:14.080> off<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.640> contents<00:04:15.640> of

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
turn the computer off the contents of

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.030 
turn the computer off the contents of
RAM<00:04:15.940> are<00:04:16.150> wiped<00:04:16.390> out<00:04:16.630> there's<00:04:17.170> nothing<00:04:17.830> left

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
RAM are wiped out there's nothing left

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.910 
RAM are wiped out there's nothing left
in<00:04:18.310> RAM<00:04:18.549> when<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.030> power<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:19.870> turned<00:04:20.260> off<00:04:20.560> so

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
in RAM when the power is turned off so

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.700 
in RAM when the power is turned off so
if<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.820> have<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> program<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.140> want<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
if you have a program that you want to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.860 
if you have a program that you want to
save<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.580> save<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.180> your<00:04:25.210> hard<00:04:25.390> drive

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
save you save it on your hard drive

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.210 
save you save it on your hard drive
because<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.590> hard<00:04:26.800> drive

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
because the hard drive

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.000 
because the hard drive
is<00:04:27.400> persistent<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.540> means<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.710> you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
is persistent and that means that you

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.190 
is persistent and that means that you
don't<00:04:30.280> lose<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:31.240> contents<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> hard

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
is I happen to have a hard drive here

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.640 
is I happen to have a hard drive here
this<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> hard<00:04:37.570> drive<00:04:37.780> it's<00:04:38.260> got<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> nice

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
this is a hard drive it's got a nice

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.310 
this is a hard drive it's got a nice
reflective<00:04:39.520> surface<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.390> platters<00:04:40.900> here

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
reflective surface on the platters here

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.650 
reflective surface on the platters here
you<00:04:41.860> can<00:04:42.040> see<00:04:42.310> one<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.820> platters<00:04:43.270> here

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
you can see one of the platters here

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.330 
you can see one of the platters here
there<00:04:43.810> are<00:04:43.930> actually<00:04:44.320> two<00:04:44.530> platters<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:45.190> this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
there are actually two platters on this

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.980 
there are actually two platters on this
hard<00:04:45.580> drive<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:46.030> can<00:04:46.210> see<00:04:46.390> if<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:46.660> look<00:04:46.840> at

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
hard drive you can see if you look at

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.200 
hard drive you can see if you look at
the<00:04:47.110> edge<00:04:47.290> of<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.650> there<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.730> there's<00:04:48.970> two

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
the edge of it there so there's two

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.140 
the edge of it there so there's two
platters<00:04:49.750> on<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:50.200> hard<00:04:50.440> drive<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:51.150> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
platters on this hard drive and and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.740 
platters on this hard drive and and
there's<00:04:53.110> an<00:04:53.260> arm<00:04:53.560> here<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.300> takes

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
there's an arm here that is that takes

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.130 
there's an arm here that is that takes
care<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.130> reading<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.400> writing<00:04:57.730> on<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.900> hard

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
care of reading and writing on this hard

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.780 
care of reading and writing on this hard
drive<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.740> hard<00:04:59.950> drive<00:05:00.190> spins<00:05:00.610> around

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
drive so the hard drive spins around

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.830 
drive so the hard drive spins around
very<00:05:01.300> fast<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:02.290> know<00:05:02.410> in<00:05:03.190> very<00:05:03.910> fast<00:05:04.180> motion

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
very fast you know in very fast motion

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.530 
very fast you know in very fast motion
and<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.260> arm<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:06.070> actually<00:05:06.940> takes<00:05:07.210> care<00:05:07.480> of

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and the arm here actually takes care of

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.170 
and the arm here actually takes care of
reading<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.350> writing<00:05:08.860> values<00:05:09.580> off<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.910> the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
reading and writing values off of the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.460 
reading and writing values off of the
hard<00:05:10.480> drive<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:14.080> arm<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:15.340> arm<00:05:15.580> here<00:05:16.470> is

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
hard drive and the arm the arm here is

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.980 
hard drive and the arm the arm here is
going<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.920> move<00:05:18.100> in<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.550> out<00:05:18.730> I<00:05:19.150> can't<00:05:19.570> do<00:05:19.780> that

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
going to move in and out I can't do that

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.720 
going to move in and out I can't do that
on<00:05:20.200> this<00:05:20.350> it's<00:05:20.560> kind<00:05:20.740> of<00:05:20.770> locked<00:05:21.040> up<00:05:21.280> right<00:05:21.520> now

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
on this it's kind of locked up right now

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.150 
on this it's kind of locked up right now
but<00:05:22.030> it<00:05:22.540> would<00:05:22.630> move<00:05:22.870> in<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.230> out<00:05:23.320> on<00:05:23.590> this<00:05:23.860> on

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
but it would move in and out on this on

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.990 
but it would move in and out on this on
the<00:05:24.400> platters<00:05:24.880> reading<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.020> writing<00:05:26.169> data

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
the platters reading and writing data

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.730

drive hard drive is actually is a very a
magnetic<00:05:35.140> surface<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.640> way<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.060> read

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
magnetic surface so the way it's read

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.480 
magnetic surface so the way it's read
and<00:05:37.540> written<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.290> reverse<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.860> polarity

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
