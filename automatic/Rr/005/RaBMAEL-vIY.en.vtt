metabolism and I lost 24 pounds and I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.139 
metabolism and I lost 24 pounds and I
got<00:00:31.920> back<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> basically<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> weighed<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
got back to basically what I weighed in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.229 
got back to basically what I weighed in
high<00:00:33.300> school<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> did<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> different

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
high school but I did it for a different

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
high school but I did it for a different
reason<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.380> mean<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> lose<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
reason but I mean I want to lose a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
reason but I mean I want to lose a
little<00:00:38.309> weight<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.059> didn't<00:00:39.600> dream<00:00:39.899> this

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
little weight but I didn't dream this

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
little weight but I didn't dream this
would<00:00:40.260> happen<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.420> did<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.700> after<00:00:44.700> i

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
would happen I did it because after i

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.869 
would happen I did it because after i
had<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.149> stint<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.730> realized<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
had this stint put in I realized that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
had this stint put in I realized that
even<00:00:48.360> though<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> happens<00:00:49.170> quite<00:00:49.350> often<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
even though it happens quite often that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.270 
even though it happens quite often that
after<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.930> bypasses<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.800> lose<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
after you have bypasses you lose the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
after you have bypasses you lose the
veins<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.059> thinner<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> weaker

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
veins because there's thinner and weaker

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
veins because there's thinner and weaker
than<00:00:55.020> arteries<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.699> truth<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
than arteries the truth is that it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
than arteries the truth is that it
clogged<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.160> which<00:00:59.160> means<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
clogged up which means that the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
clogged up which means that the
cholesterol<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.539> still<00:01:00.719> calling<00:01:01.199> buildup<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
cholesterol was still calling buildup in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.440 
cholesterol was still calling buildup in
my<00:01:02.480> vein<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.840> part<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.379> Pascal<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
my vein it was part of my by Pascal and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.880 
my vein it was part of my by Pascal and
thank<00:01:06.450> God<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> could<00:01:06.960> take<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> stents<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
thank God I could take the stents I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 
thank God I could take the stents I
don't<00:01:08.670> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> happen<00:01:09.060> again<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
don't want to happen again so I did all

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't want to happen again so I did all
this<00:01:11.430> research<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.240> saw<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> eighty-two

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
this research and I saw that eighty-two

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.649 
this research and I saw that eighty-two
percent<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.770> since<00:01:14.159> 1986<00:01:14.909> who
