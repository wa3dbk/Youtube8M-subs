Ministry of Defense here in Britain has
been<00:05:17.910> investigating<00:05:18.750> UFOs<00:05:19.259> since<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.210> 1950s

but other countries as well have had
these<00:05:23.849> sorts<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.449> incidents<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.650> think

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
these sorts of incidents and I think

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.529 
these sorts of incidents and I think
it's<00:05:25.949> a<00:05:26.009> question<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.430> trying<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.030> put<00:05:27.300> them

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
it's a question of trying to put them

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.899 
it's a question of trying to put them
together<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.169> see<00:05:28.379> see<00:05:29.190> what<00:05:29.220> pattern

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
together and see see what pattern

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.670 
together and see see what pattern
emerges<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.659> we<00:05:30.990> there<00:05:31.229> was<00:05:31.319> a<00:05:31.379> case<00:05:31.650> in

the website some of it you know it's
going<00:06:14.909> to<00:06:14.969> take<00:06:15.150> about<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.449> year<00:06:15.539> or<00:06:15.810> so<00:06:15.930> to

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
going to take about a year or so to

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.620 
going to take about a year or so to
finish<00:06:16.949> this<00:06:17.219> process<00:06:17.789> but<00:06:18.030> it's<00:06:18.419> happening

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
finish this process but it's happening

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.600 
finish this process but it's happening
right<00:06:19.080> now<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:20.009> people<00:06:20.159> are<00:06:20.370> going<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.550> be

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
right now and people are going to be

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.550 
right now and people are going to be
able<00:06:20.849> to<00:06:20.909> see<00:06:21.090> these<00:06:21.270> sorts<00:06:21.659> of<00:06:21.719> incidents<00:06:22.229> for

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
able to see these sorts of incidents for

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.589 
able to see these sorts of incidents for
themselves<00:06:22.979> but<00:06:23.190> like<00:06:23.370> I<00:06:23.400> say<00:06:23.669> it's<00:06:24.000> not<00:06:24.270> just

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
themselves but like I say it's not just

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.059 
themselves but like I say it's not just
Britain<00:06:24.990> this<00:06:25.169> has<00:06:25.319> happened<00:06:25.650> all<00:06:25.770> around<00:06:26.009> the

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
Britain this has happened all around the

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.679 
Britain this has happened all around the
law

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:30.689 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.959 

made<00:06:30.959> another<00:06:31.259> step<00:06:31.679> closer<00:06:32.069> to<00:06:32.519> finding<00:06:32.789> the

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
made another step closer to finding the

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.969 
made another step closer to finding the
holy<00:06:33.239> grail<00:06:33.509> of<00:06:33.689> all<00:06:34.259> this<00:06:34.469> astronomical

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
holy grail of all this astronomical

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.429 
holy grail of all this astronomical
research<00:06:35.399> that<00:06:35.759> we<00:06:35.879> do<00:06:36.089> and<00:06:36.330> that<00:06:36.749> is<00:06:36.779> to<00:06:36.959> find

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
research that we do and that is to find

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.169 
research that we do and that is to find
a<00:06:37.619> planet<00:06:37.949> that's<00:06:38.219> the<00:06:38.429> size<00:06:38.729> of<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.029> earth

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:39.179 
a planet that's the size of the earth

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:41.089 
a planet that's the size of the earth
and<00:06:39.419> the<00:06:39.479> right<00:06:39.809> location<00:06:40.439> around<00:06:40.649> its<00:06:40.949> star

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
and the right location around its star

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.699 
and the right location around its star
so<00:06:41.909> that<00:06:42.149> it<00:06:42.269> could<00:06:42.449> possibly<00:06:42.959> have<00:06:43.229> liquid

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:43.709 
so that it could possibly have liquid

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:46.069 
so that it could possibly have liquid
water<00:06:43.739> and<00:06:44.249> therefore<00:06:44.999> of<00:06:45.239> course<00:06:45.269> you<00:06:45.929> know

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:46.079 
water and therefore of course you know

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.619 
water and therefore of course you know
the<00:06:46.229> next<00:06:46.349> line<00:06:46.679> possibly<00:06:47.669> have<00:06:47.879> some<00:06:48.179> form<00:06:48.509> of

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
the next line possibly have some form of

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.869 
the next line possibly have some form of
life<00:06:48.899> so<00:06:49.289> that's<00:06:49.829> the<00:06:50.039> big<00:06:50.159> step<00:06:50.459> here<00:06:50.729> we

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
life so that's the big step here we

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.879 
life so that's the big step here we
found<00:06:51.179> planets<00:06:51.749> for<00:06:51.899> the<00:06:51.959> first<00:06:52.229> time<00:06:52.529> that

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
found planets for the first time that

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.039 
found planets for the first time that
are<00:06:53.249> about<00:06:53.489> the<00:06:53.819> size<00:06:54.029> of<00:06:54.329> Earth<00:06:54.569> and<00:06:54.749> that's<00:06:54.929> a

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:55.049 
are about the size of Earth and that's a

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:57.259 
are about the size of Earth and that's a
big<00:06:55.229> step<00:06:55.469> for<00:06:55.769> when<00:06:56.339> we<00:06:56.489> look<00:06:56.669> at<00:06:56.789> the<00:06:56.909> number

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:57.269 
big step for when we look at the number

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:59.839 
big step for when we look at the number
of<00:06:57.299> stars<00:06:57.719> available<00:06:58.289> in<00:06:58.469> this<00:06:58.679> galaxy<00:06:59.069> alone

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
of stars available in this galaxy alone

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.049 
of stars available in this galaxy alone
got<00:07:00.299> some<00:07:00.539> 300<00:07:01.319> billion<00:07:01.589> stars<00:07:02.189> well<00:07:02.849> the

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
got some 300 billion stars well the

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:05.479 
got some 300 billion stars well the
chances<00:07:03.389> are<00:07:03.869> that<00:07:03.929> there<00:07:04.469> are<00:07:04.649> about<00:07:05.009> twenty

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:05.489 
chances are that there are about twenty

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:09.049 
chances are that there are about twenty
three<00:07:05.819> stars<00:07:06.209> with<00:07:07.199> planets<00:07:07.559> like<00:07:08.369> ours<00:07:08.789> for

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:09.059 
three stars with planets like ours for

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.619 
three stars with planets like ours for
every<00:07:09.449> 100<00:07:10.229> stars<00:07:10.559> we<00:07:10.919> observe<00:07:11.369> so<00:07:11.819> there's<00:07:12.539> a

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:12.629 
every 100 stars we observe so there's a

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:18.999 
every 100 stars we observe so there's a
huge<00:07:13.110> number<00:07:13.679> of<00:07:13.709> possibilities<00:07:14.219> for<00:07:14.669> us

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.369

disclosure is at hand he is very close
and<00:07:22.589> the<00:07:22.649> American<00:07:23.009> people<00:07:23.279> need<00:07:23.369> to<00:07:23.489> prepare

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
and the American people need to prepare

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.879 
and the American people need to prepare
themselves<00:07:24.029> very<00:07:24.809> soon<00:07:25.110> for<00:07:25.379> an<00:07:25.439> announcement
