00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
does have one flaw and that is because

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.830 
does have one flaw and that is because
he<00:03:02.450> has<00:03:02.540> blue<00:03:02.840> paint<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.439> his<00:03:03.560> fists<00:03:03.980> there<00:03:04.840> but

transformers<00:03:40.340> animated<00:03:40.609> style<00:03:41.180> because<00:03:41.569> they

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
transformers animated style because they

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.050 
transformers animated style because they
got<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.049> curve<00:03:42.379> in<00:03:42.590> their<00:03:42.739> back<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.909> kind

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
got this curve in their back it's kind

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.949 
got this curve in their back it's kind
of<00:03:44.180> angular<00:03:44.840> curve<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.560> don't<00:03:46.069> know<00:03:46.279> why<00:03:46.959> they

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
of angular curve and don't know why they

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.360 
of angular curve and don't know why they
are<00:03:48.170> articulated<00:03:48.920> all<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.609> same<00:03:50.739> heads<00:03:51.739> can

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
are articulated all the same heads can

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.949 
are articulated all the same heads can
road<00:03:52.549> too<00:03:52.760> well<00:03:52.999> they're<00:03:53.209> not<00:03:53.329> their<00:03:53.719> heads

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
road too well they're not their heads

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.899 
road too well they're not their heads
can<00:03:54.260> be<00:03:54.290> different<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:54.920> they're<00:03:55.519> basically

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
can be different but they're basically

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.720 
can be different but they're basically
saying<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.329> head<00:03:56.569> rotates<00:03:57.019> 360<00:03:57.650> degrees<00:03:57.889> it's

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
saying the head rotates 360 degrees it's

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.140 
saying the head rotates 360 degrees it's
bald<00:03:58.999> right<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.510> go<00:04:00.079> up<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.529> down<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.370> side<00:04:02.120> to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
bald right so go up and down and side to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.750 
bald right so go up and down and side to
side<00:04:02.329> a<00:04:02.540> little<00:04:02.810> bit<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:04.189> careful<00:04:04.579> because

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
side a little bit but be careful because

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.670 
side a little bit but be careful because
if<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:05.029> twist<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.420> too<00:04:05.599> much<00:04:05.779> and<00:04:05.989> pop<00:04:06.170> off<00:04:06.379> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
if you twist it too much and pop off and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.339 
if you twist it too much and pop off and
that<00:04:06.799> loosens<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.219> joint<00:04:07.749> the<00:04:08.749> arms<00:04:09.139> rotate

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
that loosens the joint the arms rotate

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.670 
that loosens the joint the arms rotate
here<00:04:10.069> and<00:04:10.519> then<00:04:11.029> they<00:04:11.180> move<00:04:11.359> in<00:04:11.659> and<00:04:11.930> out<00:04:12.079> like

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
here and then they move in and out like

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.589 
here and then they move in and out like
that

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
that

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.610 
that
unfortunately<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.690> hands<00:04:15.930> don't<00:04:16.290> have<00:04:16.440> any

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
unfortunately the hands don't have any

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.920 
unfortunately the hands don't have any
movement<00:04:17.010> themselves<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.150> legs<00:04:18.389> are<00:04:18.570> kind<00:04:18.810> of

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
movement themselves the legs are kind of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.289 
movement themselves the legs are kind of
odd<00:04:19.109> they<00:04:19.350> have<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.370> three<00:04:21.090> got

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
odd they have they have three got

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.000 
odd they have they have three got
universal<00:04:21.989> joints<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.530> if<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.710> want<00:04:22.889> them

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
universal joints so if you want them

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.430 
universal joints so if you want them
sitting<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:24.150> good<00:04:24.360> if<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.630> what<00:04:24.780> I'm<00:04:24.930> doing

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
sitting it's good if you what I'm doing

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.530 
sitting it's good if you what I'm doing
a<00:04:25.590> weird<00:04:25.860> backwards<00:04:26.370> pose<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.760> good<00:04:26.970> they<00:04:27.479> see

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
a weird backwards pose is good they see

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.750 
a weird backwards pose is good they see
for<00:04:27.930> moving<00:04:28.199> forward<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.919> got<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.370> joint

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
for moving forward it's got this joint

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.719 
for moving forward it's got this joint
so<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.210> moves<00:04:30.590> like<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:32.520> for

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
so it moves like that and then for

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.960 
so it moves like that and then for
twisting<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.330> got<00:04:33.510> this<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:33.870> joint<00:04:34.970> that

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
twisting it's got this other joint that

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.170 
twisting it's got this other joint that
rotates<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.660> then<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.930> knee<00:04:37.080> bends<00:04:38.180> what's

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
rotates and then the knee bends what's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.390 
rotates and then the knee bends what's
it<00:04:39.330> interesting<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.900> know<00:04:40.050> as<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.770> why

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
it interesting to know as I see why

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.620 
it interesting to know as I see why
these<00:04:41.460> are<00:04:41.669> 666<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:42.830> not<00:04:43.830> probably<00:04:44.610> seven<00:04:45.540> or

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
these are 666 and not probably seven or

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.770 
these are 666 and not probably seven or
eight<00:04:45.840> dollars<00:04:46.940> because<00:04:47.940> they<00:04:48.360> didn't<00:04:48.630> use

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
eight dollars because they didn't use

eight dollars because they didn't use
