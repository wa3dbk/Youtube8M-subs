 sizes who micro orchids 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.530
 if you look calmly with the whole 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.710
 attention if you will see that they are plants 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 Wonderful 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.129
 the event is a traditional event that in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 homage to the city that is made today 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 then invites the cities of the interior 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.050
 everything to make the exhibitions like the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 people participate in rusty city in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.579
 participate in the people and a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.190
 in the plants determining the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.430
 first second placed third 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.719
 This artist arrived 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.690
 enthusiastic about the expectation of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.600
 to record material for your 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 painting thinks everything to me is that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.260
 wonder the source of inspiration for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.680
 of the cultivar also because it has 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.409
 a few pennies and more then that's all 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 this orquidófilo speaks that the passion arises 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.549
 any time 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.470
 It was out of curiosity, it 's as if my 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.110
 father likes plants very much and plant 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 care began to take care of and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 I now take care of him more than he 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.100
 the flower trade promotes the market 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 which is every day in evidence 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.189
 the market is growing expanding 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.170
 because today they were something like this. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.460
 roberto trend was in brazil 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 flowering time rarity and species 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.009
 these are some important issues in the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 time to determine the value of orchids 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.090
 here for example uses 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 they are very democratic starting in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.840
 R $ 10 and up to R $ 300 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.039
 clinical view is important to observe 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.600
 every detail we cultivate this no longer 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.330
 we looked so much by the color 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.300
 we look at the shape of the plant then the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.420
 plant must have a rounded shape 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.640
 do not have to have flaws are everything 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 this is taken into account sometimes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.230
 you buy the plant and you have a 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.990
 very different condition in your home from 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 that the plant has nature then it is to see the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.940
 how people cultivate is to quote in the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.890
 vessel is on top of which substrates 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 used is very interesting 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.120
 who started as a hobby today see the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.130
 benefits 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.790
 several people look for associations 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.280
 to learn to cultivate by therapy, right? 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.160
 and then another that you discover that you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.800
 makes a large circle of friends and does not 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 is that the city itself has even flower 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.270
 in the region of santo andré is a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.340
 plant that is this symbol plant is a 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.390
 symphony of cuisine and found here in 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.110
 our saw but it was difficult despite 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.630
 being from our region is what you are 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.959
 complicated but it is a very 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.019
 is very used in crosses 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.660
 care is essential to care for 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.110
 of your orchid orchid is a plant 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 with a little bit of 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.660
 And you take care that this 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.630
 plant will survive perfectly with another 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.019
 plant any then the purpose of the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.769
 our lectures and our lectures is 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.200
 precisely this teaching the concepts 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.610
 basic 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.000
