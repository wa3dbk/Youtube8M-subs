00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
it's got a little heel to it so you got

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.479 
it's got a little heel to it so you got
that<00:03:46.930> elevation<00:03:47.530> you're<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.069> look<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.340> little

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
longer but it's really comfortable for

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.780 
longer but it's really comfortable for
