00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.499
 hello how are you I'm hero thunder and now 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.689
 I'm making another video about 

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:09.599
 civilizations and good this time I'll talk 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.459
 of the Persians at the request of people I 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 I make the videos randomly but 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.039
 As several already asked, I was prioritizing 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.890
 about the interests of the subscribers 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 good let's start the video the Persians are 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 a cavalry civilization and also 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.339
 they are an excellent civilization of easy 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 development or good boom in others 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:33.150
 words the good thing about this civilization 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 is that they start with 250 food and 250 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.560
 of wood in standard items other 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.020
 civilizations almost all the other 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.900
 civilizations better said begin with 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.470
 200 of food and 200 of wood this is already 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.080
 an advantage 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.990
 It is also a civilization where its 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.540
 urban centers work 10 fastest 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.510
 in feudal age 15 in the age of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.580
 castles and 20 in imperial age which 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.170
 speaks of an excellent civilization for 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.340
 develop in a more attack map 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.769
 late that is to say of no rus 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.070
 and most importantly its urban centers 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.440
 they have 4800 resistance points from 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 average age that equals resistance 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.790
 that has any castle without 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.800
 improve it in university which if still 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 they do not attack him unexpectedly he has a lot 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.670
 advantage to kill the units that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 attack the urban center like those that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 they are close to him so the Persians are 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.869
 used for the ruc of the urban center 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 the player destroys his urban center in 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.130
 full middle age or dark age and what 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.080
 build in the enemy city clear that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 this rush does not do anybody and itself 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.390
 it is quite risky if it goes wrong 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.939
 here we see that develop the unit 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.820
 special from the Persians to him and they cost you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.710
 1600 of food and 1200 gold and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.719
 develop with the cas that is a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 technology that makes their elephants get 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.719
 move faster it costs 300 of food and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.780
 300 gold making a total of 1,900 of 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.819
 food and 1500 gold is remarkably 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.459
 much more economical than developing full 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.799
 alaska is fractal by the Byzantines and 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.439
 these elephants well developed in 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.450
 barn smithy and castles are worth this 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.300
 well-deserved price 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.550
 although as I said before the Persians are 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 a cavalry civilization which 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.440
 they have excellent paladins camels and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.930
 be used with full speed blacksmithing 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.000
 fast and resistant also have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.940
 archers but they are not very good 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 some armors and their infantry are missing 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.519
 it's pretty poor they just have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.519
 halberdiers 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.739
 they are excellent in technology they have 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.540
 trucks and manual gunners in their 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.010
 siege they have a gross and scorpions 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.560
 heavy 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.540
 use the Persians and especially if you 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 they use their elephants which is why they 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.730
 the Persians are remembered requires 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.489
 too much food of too much food 200 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.530
 of food and 75 gold is what it costs 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.750
 this unit the war elephants 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.440
 they cost the same gold that it costs to create a 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.299
 paladin 75 so if they use it they believe be 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.239
 at least 50 farms to get to 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.610
 minute 45 if it 's from norris with elephants 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.560
 developed 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.630
 the Persian cavalry is one of the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.120
 best of the age of empires in my opinion 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.480
 your paladins have 180 of life and 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.430
 they have livestock they have camels and you use 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.040
 they have the complete cavalry 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.200
 in gold they are not that expensive because 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.270
 developing the elephants costs more 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.030
 food than anything else and if it 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.340
 use elephants do not use paladins because 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
 that would be a waste of gold if 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.630
 they need something that runs fast to 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.790
 gangsters that only cost food 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.890
 and well that was the positive thing about that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.470
 civilization now I'm going to talk about the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.570
 points against the Persians 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.850
 although they have an excellent cavalry 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.250
 one of the best I would say and have 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.230
 good developing economy but what 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.510
 bad of this civilization is that it makes you 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.340
 depend a lot on the cavalry that is 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.800
 that they do not have the alternative of having 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.800
 champions to defend their cavalry 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.140
 to paladins or Persian elephants and their 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.300
 archers are more or less poor no 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.700
 they become crossbows and their gunners 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.860
 manuals are expensive to create that leads to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.470
 the Persians to be a bit expensive if you take 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.330
 that alternative added to that the Persians 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.090
 they do not have full armor in their 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.340
 archers to be this leads to the one who 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.230
 use the Persians to have to use yes or yes 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.450
 halberdiers to defend the 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.130
 Beefeater elephants that are that most 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.290
 damage the cavalry itself and the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.870
 elephants and the best 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.660
 use manual gunners or scorpions 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.150
 heavy use gunners or scorpions 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.010
 heavy are expensive in gold although a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.140
 attack with elite war elephants 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.650
 fully developed makes 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.509
 have 620 of life and almost 20 attack 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.400
 they are war tanks with life for 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.440
 anyone who faces except for 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.400
 some excellent civilizations of 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.400
 siege and camels 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.529
 so I think that this is a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
 civilization for maps of black forest 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.789
 or michi mack with the 40 a little more u 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.129
 another development map without attacks 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.469
 early because this civilization in a 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.539
 map of rus as green arabia makes them 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.729
 very vulnerable if you intend to use 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.199
 the elephants because the players 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.389
 from green to arabia are always 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.400
 using cheap units while 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.529
 sustain economically and move forward in 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.449
 the attacks which to an elephant without 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.969
 nothing to develop makes them very bad 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.319
 in if the elephants of the Persians are 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.080
 a unit to destroy buildings 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.099
 although well developed they are charged to 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.110
 to be 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.089
 In addition, archers can kill 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.830
 elephants if they have not developed it 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:37.620
 they are so slow that they die on the way 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.419
 in my opinion the only good thing that has 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.909
 this civilization in its attack are its 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.129
 elephants that are like four paladins 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.499
 together between your points of resistance and 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.680
 attack is worth the same gold but the 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:51.960
 elephants worth 125 more food not 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.580
 I recommend this civilization to a newbie 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.710
 because in if to have the elephants 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.499
 developed completely at least 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.330
 minute 45 takes a lot of practice and I think 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.470
 that many would die in the attempt to 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.890
 develop them 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.240
 to create your army that is another burden 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.400
 as long as you intend to use it 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.140
 strong to civilization you have to 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.900
 know they use and one would have to 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.760
 like this civilization and well that was 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.980
 everything about this civilization I'm going 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.640
 ending the video greetings to those of 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.640
