to do it's not just what can they do to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
to do it's not just what can they do to
stop<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> stuff

this office there's so many different

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
this office there's so many different
ways<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.190> can<00:01:35.340> try<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> attack<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.090> defense
