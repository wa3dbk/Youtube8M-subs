00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.059
 very important point is the glass for 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.540
 monomer 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:23.869
 we used to see little cups 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:28.460
 with a round groove for the bottom inside 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.009
 parts and small in size I want 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.649
 say that this is his bed with 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.719
 of this form of capacity firstly it is not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.700
 correct and this capacity is not enough 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.620
 so that the brush could really 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.899
 enjoy being in a mono measure me and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.359
 kept her clean 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.359
 capacity with to should not be enough 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.329
 full glass you need to be enough 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.219
 heavy so that he was steady one 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.670
 the cup should be flat 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.010
 in order to work out in time and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.070
 scrolling brush brush not 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.650
 rolled up in shape 1 such here 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.870
 a roll in a bagel and the brush is absolutely 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.780
 could easily be distributed along the bottom 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.899
 cup and show here is all your nap 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.259
 as far as it is pure as it is not 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.700
 no rain and so cute 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.180
 regarding the cup I have a candlestick 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.469
 store bought for the interior is 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.740
 hooked to where the candle is set 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:34.789
 thick one very comfortable and I had another 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.130
 decorated with rhinestones sleep slaves here 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.780
 such we should be a glass further 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.909
 next important point 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.500
 noticed that they are important with 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.500
 we have no acrylic 10 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:58.390
 now the next one more very important 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.390
 the moment is what we wipe and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.579
 following 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.060
 again a very important point is the glass itself 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.060
 for monomer
