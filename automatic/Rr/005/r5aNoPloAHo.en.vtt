00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.470
 or the people in italy he is marc anthony 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 I am a tacho and we are the co-founders 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.110
 from the country to barcelona we dedicate ourselves to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.330
 design the production and sale of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.720
 smartphone and tablet accessories and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.699
 we look at the products we have 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.380
 starting with simpler bonds would be 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 the skins that are a kind of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 wooden stickers that we hooked 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 to the back of the iphone like this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 we also have patches that are covers 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 made 100% by hand here in Barcelona and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.739
 finally we also have the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 ipad cases we always use 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.370
 materials that do not harm the environment 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 environment and in this regard for example 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 We have 8 types of wood, all of them 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.129
 coming from plantations that is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 Certified woods that will not be in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 any forest are plantations and that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.910
 do not harm the environment and in the case of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 skins for example what we do is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 always use skins that come 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.770
 of the food industry that is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 for example of cows that have 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.289
 used meat for people to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 eat and then on the skin and we 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.350
 for these are the skins that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 that we use I think they make them 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.900
 quite good sections each have their 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.350
 its parts in my case I dedicate myself a 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.690
 little more to online marketing a little 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
 also to the design part I am 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.190
 industrial engineer and then I would 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 I order a bit stronger part 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.250
 production of the design of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 utensils because for me the output is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 a Hawaiian bird that lives in the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.300
 volcanic slopes of hawaii 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.160
 It is a bird that differs by 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.720
 others because he is able to take some 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.729
 seeds that for others are 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 poisonous then a bird so small 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.020
 thanks to a differentiation regarding 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.280
 the rest is able to survive based 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.759
 to feed on these seeds 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.440
 then we see ourselves a little was 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.050
 as a little our reflection not a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.670
 so small company that in these times 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.960
 that many that you say are so 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.979
 difficult we are not doing things 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.929
 different 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.700
 you can differentiate yourself and still you can 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.009
 keep surviving I started as 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.300
 Inventor engineer and Marc Anthony 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.010
 a passionate about design 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.930
 and innovation we are always 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.690
 trying to create new products and 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.170
