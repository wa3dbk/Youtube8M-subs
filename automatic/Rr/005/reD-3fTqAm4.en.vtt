other high-end devices on the market
keeping<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.600> mind<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.140> also<00:04:44.260> a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
keeping in mind that this is also a

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.720

hundred and ninety-nine dollars I think

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.610 
hundred and ninety-nine dollars I think
it's<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.880> fair<00:04:46.060> comparison<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:47.020> pit<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.410> up

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
it's a fair comparison to pit this up

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.600 
it's a fair comparison to pit this up
against<00:04:47.919> some<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> other<00:04:48.400> high-end

ergonomically friendly but again the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.190 
ergonomically friendly but again the
camera<00:05:00.820> needs<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.180> little<00:05:01.510> bit<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:01.720> work<00:05:01.930> also
