720<00:00:50.390> 480<00:00:51.469> with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> Wii<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:55.199> comes<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.620> 40<00:00:56.010> i

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
720 480 with the Wii it comes with 40 i

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.910 
720 480 with the Wii it comes with 40 i
but<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> certain<00:00:58.079> cable<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
but you need to get a certain cable to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.200 
but you need to get a certain cable to
make<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.250> for<00:01:00.030> EP<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:05.210> an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
make it for EP so what this does is an

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.050 
make it for EP so what this does is an
option<00:01:07.340> which<00:01:08.340> allows<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> 480p<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
option which allows it to go to 480p and
