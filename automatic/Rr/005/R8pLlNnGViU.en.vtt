00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello my name is bastian pastewka and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 this is the pastewka top 5 this time 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 the most spectacular guest space five 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 occupied a hero of my television has child 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.010
 namely martin semmelrogge martin 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.390
 Semmelrogge was right in our first 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 in the wake of the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.099
 flea market martin semmelrogge meets there 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 on me on bastian and always says 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.280
 Dude you are not that stupid either 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.340
 Much does not do as dan o'brien 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.050
 At the very end of this episode must martin 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 semmelrogge, so to speak, again as he 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 even advertise an anti-alcohol 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 spot turning in our fiction are there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.760
 then many teenagers under one 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.160
 bridge and martin semmelrogge comes along 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 the magic wand and I say 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.690
 I just wish that could be here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.690
 times 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.489
 that's what fabricers think is the best material 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.990
 There is some teaching material in there 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.360
 someday only burn 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.619
 that has made the spectacular and we 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.800
 have a bright joy when turning 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.800
 had 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.890
 we have many guests at pastewka 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.750
 but sometimes very big ones come 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 laying down to us and such is one 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.869
 of course frank elsner frank elstner was 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.830
 Visiting us in the fourth season 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.800
 of pastewka in the wake of the wg 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.270
 mister ways and the mister pastewka that very much 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.789
 interesting then the rumors agree 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.190
 after all, he is terribly upset 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.369
 about me and really gets very 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.229
 very loud and frank elsner has that 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.530
 played fantastically and that way 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.560
 Fantastic that with us the team as it 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.690
 the first sample has seen 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.649
 the real frank elstner would be real 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.300
 freak out 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.590
 it was not like that, but I remember 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.850
 me to a sound man with his 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.170
 angel there was thought oh my god what 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.390
 what happens here happens what happens 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 here you have such a colleague pig 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.460
 I do not think that's possible 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.810
 held 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.040
 human do not look so stupid frank 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.750
 Of course, elstners are really nice 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 perfectly adapted to our script 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.040
 and as he understands mister she is fun 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.390
 may he allow himself everything and in 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.310
 he has bastian all our group 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.790
 fantastically tricked and he has it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.790
 Correct! Well done 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.900
 3rd place is the most spectacular guest 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.370
 roger willemsen roger willemsen was at 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.870
 even follow us in two 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.670
 one of the fifth season but mine 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.430
 favorite moment is he from the sixth 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.860
 season out of the wake of the parking pass 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.480
 There he bastian caught driving 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.850
 he himself comes with a bicycle hat 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 a very flat bike helmet on and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.780
 notes that bastian apparently with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.000
 wrong parking cards handle what he does 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.580
 but only out of necessity and makes 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.210
 roger willemsen gives it right gas 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.190
 and say to bastian we live accordingly 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.510
 now in 2013 we have the world 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.410
 borrowed from our children just like 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.300
 should continue with the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.610
 Global warming nuclear sees the famous 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.080
 Quote from William James Online Business 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.460
 I can not say what william 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.680
 James was an American philosopher 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.720
 from the nineteenth century from him 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120
 comes the sentence a chain is always like that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.470
 strong as your weakest link is 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.030
 by james statements arises 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.040
 of course, as a printer wilson itself 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.080
 a suv drives and not like bastian 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 a rickety says roger willemsen 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.780
 the contrary is he has none 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.590
 Incidentally , he also has a driver's license 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.780
 no bike helmet 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.670
 but it is one of the most environmentally conscious 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.170
 people at all and it's fun 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.670
 made in a row in complete against 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.990
 to turn the line and that one can 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.680
 only with people doing this class are 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.680
 like Roger Willemsen 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.310
 on the second place of the most spectacular guests 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.830
 for me clearly dieter frond the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.709
 Great director of German 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.970
 tv game so one of the best 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.660
 fernsehmacher we in germany 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.459
 to have 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.349
 He is probably a director 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.410
 much better known than himself 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.269
 Dieter Wedel is a like I think 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.769
 great actor like you before 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.519
 all in all, the great kessler 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.440
 could see 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.790
 Dieter Wedel had to do just that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.200
 Do what he likes to do, namely yourself 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.269
 just like me in the game 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.690
 make a series and that's how Dieter Wedel came to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.100
 we had his text perfectly on it 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.450
 may I also say this is not 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.340
 with everyone we have 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.810
 Dieter Wedel had fun with it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.940
 to pull yourself through the cocoa 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.430
 He came with a casual sunglasses 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.510
 He said my god then I have 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.479
 erotic movies shot 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.070
 but nobody should know well kessler 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.510
 sucks 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.370
 but I really have seven successes 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.969
 turned 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.289
 in front 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.499
 You realize that were really the best 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.999
 So really thank you the type of link 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.529
 did not play that is really good 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.389
 i know you today lower countries 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.399
 opinion he has really that way 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.139
 well done that follow like me 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.209
 knows until today is a cult result 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.799
 especially among television producers 

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:01.719
 the table only as a director and not 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.969
 as an actor know but also here 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:06.039
 It's great to be a guest when laying 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.589
 Has and Dieter Wedel is one of the 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.569
 largest and not many of them 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:13.469
 necessarily in front of the camera with 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.469
 Distance made best 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.459
 the most spectacular guests of pastewka 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.229
 figuring out a number one here is 

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:28.629
 in any case unfair because we had so 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.009
 many spectacular guests also mine 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.869
 Dear friend from the comedy business 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.399
 annette frier anke engelke michael 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:35.469
 kessler hugo egon balder like you all 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:38.049
 He is regularly with us here 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.499
 are all spectacular but you 

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:42.459
 are unfortunately outbid by one of all 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.559
 Namely most spectacular guest ever 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.559
 from our fifth season in the episode 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.579
 number five the result is called the bread 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:54.039
 and the guest I had mine is 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:06:01.349
 of course the bread is beautiful 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:01.349
 Good morning is only worse for me 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:10.449
 i'm not awake the dreams at bernd 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:12.039
 We called the bread so that 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.429
 bread has a mobile bernd the bread goes 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.589
 ran 

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:16.419
 we asked Bernd old house with 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:18.999
 new windows how are you you have 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.229
 like to play along with pastewka and bernd 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:21.249
 Of course, the bread immediately said 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.349
 No 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.549
 then we had to persuade him a little bit 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.079
 we have a bit with his 

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:27.909
 puppeteer spoken that is allowed any 

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:29.229
 Let's just say that we have these 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.869
 do not even write 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.339
 if bernd can cancel the bread 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.539
 The bread has changed a lot 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.849
 behave professionally 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.559
 bernd the bread was bernd 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.659
 the bread was very very bad private 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:42.309
 but it's always like that 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.529
 he's a bad-tempered guy 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:45.549
 box bread but he is not a bad one 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.229
 actor 

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:50.049
 I can tell that at this point 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.149
 bernd the bread my forever number 

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:53.069
 one of the most spectacular guests at 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.890
 Pastewka 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:59.080
 hello my name is bastian 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.300
 pilawa and this is the top 5 of 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.720
 pastevka this time the most embarrassing 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.720
 outfits
