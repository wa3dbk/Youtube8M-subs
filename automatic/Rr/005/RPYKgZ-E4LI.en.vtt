00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.800
 almost indescribable emotions 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.840
 but although we love to enjoy watching 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.180
 the best moves or discussing the

 controversies of the court this sport 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.310
 it's also risky in many ways 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.180
 now we will see some of the injuries 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.040
 most brutal football 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.790
 scorer of vyborg efe scoring in his 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.510
 first matches and five goals 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.610
 unfortunately accumulated his rise 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.729

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.040

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.860
 ankle that kept him out of the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.020
 courts for little more than six months 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 not even Brazilian players are 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 they have saved from some serious injury 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.740
 luciano almeida was a victim of bad 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.690
 luck in trying to anticipate the ball 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.470
 during his confrontation against the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.840

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.929
 fixed on the lawn while he did the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.670
 movement and attention surpassed her 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 generating a fracture and dislocated its 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.959
 Luciano's ankle left the field almost 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.959
 unconscious because of the pain 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.390
 if the Brazilians have not been saved what 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.580
 say of the Mexicans 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.940

 during a recovery of the ball 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.810
 he suffered a brutal ankle fracture what 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.410
 that kept him off the field by 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410
 some months 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.970

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.090
 opponent rolled the same with the leg 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.820
 ahead opening a wound of 25 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.100
 centimeters in his leg and so deep 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.190
 that left the bone exposed to view 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.610
 of all something simply amazing and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.610
 brutal 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.230

 between the arsenal and the bringham city 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.670
 after receiving a violent entry 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.069
 the impact ended up fracturing the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.920
 left leg so he left the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.750
 playgrounds for a good time 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.990
 losing the Euro Cup 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.610

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.010
 soccer 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.540
 matches on the gemini board when 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.990

 he suffered a fracture although he already 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.819
 planned his retirement this only served to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 overtake it 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.159
 the French djibril cissé unlike 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.489
 many other players who have suffered 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.930
 injury was unlucky to know what 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.620
 what it feels like to happen in two 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.320
 sometimes 30 October 2004 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.599
 during a struggle and upon receiving a 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 entrance behind the leg suffered 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.039
 a fracture that forced him to leave by 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.120
 a game time for your bad luck 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:30.610
 on June 7, 2006 while playing 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.949
 against the Chinese squad and after 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.289
 getting shoved in the back lost 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.539
 twisting his leg balance what 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.610
 degenerated into a painful fracture of 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.970
 warm and fibula that sent him back to 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.970
 hospital 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.389

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.469
 the year of 1996 passed and in what 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.199
 it seemed to be a match like any 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:58.110
 another of the English league and during a 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.360
 common play in front of the goal 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.629
 defenses of both teams one of them 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.159
 david boost came for the ball 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.559
 but in the tremendous clash between both 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.139
 the ankle of boost was split in two 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.659
 parts in such a brutal way that the 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.089
 bone tear the flesh the amount of 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.029
 blood that sprouted had to be cleaned 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:21.360
 of the lawn and the goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:24.029
 he saw firsthand all he had to 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.210
 receive psychological help after so 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:29.729
