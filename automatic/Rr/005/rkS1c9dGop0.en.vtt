if<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.309> had<00:00:14.429> actually<00:00:14.849> hit<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.150> shots<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.780> would

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
if I had actually hit my shots he would

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.300 
if I had actually hit my shots he would
have<00:00:16.020> both<00:00:16.109> been<00:00:16.320> dead<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.100> would<00:00:17.220> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
have both been dead and we would have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.429 
have both been dead and we would have
been<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> nothing<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> IMR<00:00:19.260> which

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
been up to nothing this is the IMR which

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
been up to nothing this is the IMR which
is<00:00:19.560> around<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.039> burst<00:00:20.400> weapon<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> really

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
is around a burst weapon which is really

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689 
is around a burst weapon which is really
shocking<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.260> me<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.650> hate<00:00:23.010> first

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shocking for me because I hate first

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.070 
shocking for me because I hate first
weapons<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.359> always<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.900> they're

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
weapons I always think that they're

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.529 
weapons I always think that they're
subpar<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.769> most<00:00:26.010> other<00:00:26.250> weapons<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
subpar to most other weapons and the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
subpar to most other weapons and the
reason<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.920> actually<00:00:29.070> have

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
reason is is because you actually have

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
reason is is because you actually have
to<00:00:29.429> aim<00:00:29.580> them<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.090> suck<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.510> aiming<00:00:30.810> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to aim them and I suck at aiming it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
to aim them and I suck at aiming it's
actually<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.439> hard<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> aim<00:00:31.980> things<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
actually really hard to aim things in

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.790 
actually really hard to aim things in
this<00:00:32.910> game<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.780> kidding<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.590> need<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this game just kidding I just need to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
this game just kidding I just need to
practice<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.329> gun<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.960> pretty

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
practice more but this gun is pretty

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
practice more but this gun is pretty
awesome<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> different<00:00:39.450> episode

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
awesome now this is a different episode

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.990 
awesome now this is a different episode
for<00:00:40.170> most<00:00:40.410> others<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.730> probably

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
for most others because this is probably

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580 
for most others because this is probably
going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.600> last<00:00:42.780> episode<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
going to be the last episode in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.410 
going to be the last episode in the
series<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> triple<00:00:44.610> spray<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
series i just got a triple spray the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
series i just got a triple spray the
reason<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.559> least<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.070> last

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
reason that is or at least the last

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580 
reason that is or at least the last
episode<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.960> gonna<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.410> all

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
episode that you think it's gonna be all

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.139 
episode that you think it's gonna be all
about<00:00:49.739> opee<00:00:50.190> weapons<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> reason<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
about opee weapons and the reason is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
about opee weapons and the reason is
there's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.260> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> overpowered<00:00:53.399> weapons

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's not a lot of overpowered weapons

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
there's not a lot of overpowered weapons
in<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.059> game<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> fact<00:00:54.600> most<00:00:54.809> weapons<00:00:55.140> are

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in this game in fact most weapons are

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.160 
in this game in fact most weapons are
pretty<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.460> same<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.539> bowel<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pretty much the same the bowel is the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
pretty much the same the bowel is the
only<00:00:58.379> weapon<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.949> extremely<00:00:59.699> strong

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
only weapon that's extremely strong

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
right now and that's only because it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.460 
right now and that's only because it's
got<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> bunch<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> base<00:01:03.480> stats<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.409> are

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that thing all those things together

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140

really<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.650> strong<00:01:13.860> weapon<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.880> when

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
really make it a strong weapon but when

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
really make it a strong weapon but when
you<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.049> yet<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.220> not

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

you get down to it yet it's not
overpowered<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.840> overpowered<00:01:19.500> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
overpowered it's not overpowered just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.249 
overpowered it's not overpowered just
like<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> AK<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:21.090> call<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> duty<00:01:21.720> 4<00:01:21.750> isn't

like the AK from call of duty 4 isn't
overpowered<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.920> probably<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> best<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
overpowered it's probably the best in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
overpowered it's probably the best in
its<00:01:24.060> class<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.350> bit<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
its class but with a little bit of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
its class but with a little bit of
tweaking<00:01:25.979> its<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.180> overpowered<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.290> gun<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
tweaking its not overpowered this gun is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
tweaking its not overpowered this gun is
not<00:01:28.860> overpowered<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> four<00:01:29.790> round<00:01:30.030> burst

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
not overpowered it's a four round burst

overpowered<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> lack<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> guns

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
overpowered is because the lack of guns

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
overpowered is because the lack of guns
that<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.570> affected<00:02:04.320> by<00:02:04.350> perks<00:02:05.009> and
