the fact that there are actually five

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.840 
the fact that there are actually five
pentatonic<00:00:29.820> boxes<00:00:31.129> everybody<00:00:32.129> pretty<00:00:32.700> much

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
pentatonic boxes everybody pretty much

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.919 
pentatonic boxes everybody pretty much
in<00:00:33.270> their<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.750> their<00:00:34.140> mom<00:00:34.379> knows<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.040> one

which<00:00:39.929> is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.589> pentatonic<00:00:41.219> box<00:00:41.460> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
which is the first pentatonic box that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
which is the first pentatonic box that
pretty<00:00:41.999> much<00:00:42.179> everybody<00:00:42.749> learns<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> then

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
pretty much everybody learns and then

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.660 
pretty much everybody learns and then
there's<00:00:43.589> this<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.399> people

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
there's this one that some people

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.870 
there's this one that some people
learned<00:00:44.850> eventually<00:00:45.359> to

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.980

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
are actually three more highly useful

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.480 
are actually three more highly useful
pentatonic<00:00:54.990> boxes<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.650> then<00:00:55.980> there's<00:00:56.160> even<00:00:56.220> a

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
pentatonic boxes and then there's even a

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.830 
pentatonic boxes and then there's even a
few<00:00:56.670> other<00:00:56.850> different<00:00:57.270> patterns<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.720> i'm

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
few other different patterns that i'm

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.000

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that a lot of guitar players don't

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
that a lot of guitar players don't
really<00:01:10.020> tend<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> focus<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.119> unless<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.420> play

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
really tend to focus on unless they play

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
really tend to focus on unless they play
like<00:01:12.750> country<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.369> major<00:01:14.700> pentatonic

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
like country is the major pentatonic

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.890 
like country is the major pentatonic
scale<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.200> sound<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.950> cool<00:01:17.869> with<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
scale which can sound very cool with a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.780 
scale which can sound very cool with a
lot<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.380> different<00:01:19.710> applications<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.580> than

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
lot of different applications other than

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
lot of different applications other than
just<00:01:21.060> country<00:01:21.450> music<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.290> i'm<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> show

mean<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.470> say<00:01:28.680> pentatonic<00:01:29.280> pentatonic

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
mean when I say pentatonic pentatonic

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.600

means<00:01:30.330> this<00:01:30.509> Penta<00:01:31.259> meaning<00:01:31.560> five<00:01:31.800> tonic

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
means this Penta meaning five tonic

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.020 
means this Penta meaning five tonic
meeting<00:01:32.910> tone<00:01:33.119> five<00:01:33.990> tone<00:01:34.470> scale<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.580> every

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
meeting tone five tone scale so every

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.430 
meeting tone five tone scale so every
pentatonic<00:01:36.570> scale<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.200> no<00:01:37.410> matter

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
pentatonic scale out there no matter

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.710 
pentatonic scale out there no matter
which<00:01:37.770> major<00:01:38.160> minor<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.149> other<00:01:39.420> type<00:01:39.690> of

pentatonic scale has five different
tones<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.200> let's<00:01:43.410> go<00:01:43.530> ahead<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> start

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
tones in it so let's go ahead and start

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
tones in it so let's go ahead and start
this<00:01:44.220> video<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.550> by<00:01:44.880> taking<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.210> look<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this video off by taking a look at the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
this video off by taking a look at the
major<00:01:45.810> side<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> things<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.280> scales

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
major side of things all these scales

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.499 
major side of things all these scales
that<00:01:47.729> i'm<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.000> show<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.330> going<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that i'm going to show you are going to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.920 
that i'm going to show you are going to
be<00:01:48.570> based<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> g<00:01:49.440> tonality<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
be based out of the g tonality so that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.350 
be based out of the g tonality so that
you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.170> hear<00:01:52.470> g<00:01:52.740> major<00:01:52.950> vs<00:01:53.490> g<00:01:53.700> minor<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> hear

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you can hear g major vs g minor and hear

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
you can hear g major vs g minor and hear
them<00:01:54.479> together<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.650> let's<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.430> ahead<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.700> take

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
them together so let's go ahead and take

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
them together so let's go ahead and take
a<00:01:56.970> look<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.390> notes<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:58.080> actually<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
a look at what notes are actually in the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.070 
a look at what notes are actually in the
g<00:01:59.040> major<00:01:59.250> pentatonic<00:01:59.700> scale<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.690> have<00:02:00.869> your

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
g major pentatonic scale you have your

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.270 
g major pentatonic scale you have your
route<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.590> first<00:02:01.979> scale<00:02:02.549> degree<00:02:02.580> g

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
route or first scale degree g

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.650 
route or first scale degree g
you<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.240> your<00:02:05.390> second<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:07.030> your<00:02:08.030> major<00:02:08.300> third

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
you have your second a your major third

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.800 
you have your second a your major third
of<00:02:08.899> be<00:02:10.120> your<00:02:11.120> five<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.810> D<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.730> then<00:02:14.120> your<00:02:14.420> six

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
of be your five of D and then your six

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.540 
of be your five of D and then your six
of<00:02:15.050> e<00:02:16.959> G<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.350> B<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:20.750> up<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.020> G<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.290> course

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.150 

and<00:02:23.640> all<00:02:24.510> those<00:02:24.660> notes<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.230> repeated<00:02:25.710> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
and all those notes get repeated so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680 
and all those notes get repeated so
let's<00:02:26.340> go<00:02:26.460> ahead<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.790> start<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.240> video<00:02:27.450> off

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
let's go ahead and start this video off

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.840 
let's go ahead and start this video off
by<00:02:28.170> taking<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.620> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> five<00:02:29.310> patterns

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
by taking a look at the five patterns

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.430 
by taking a look at the five patterns
that<00:02:30.030> make<00:02:30.240> up<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> g<00:02:30.810> major<00:02:31.020> pentatonic

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
that make up the g major pentatonic

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.580 
that make up the g major pentatonic
scale<00:02:32.510> alright<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.660> before<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:34.020> get<00:02:34.110> started<00:02:34.260> I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
scale alright so before we get started I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.260 
scale alright so before we get started I
want<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> point<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.880> five

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
want to point out that all these five

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.790 
want to point out that all these five
main<00:02:36.540> patterns<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.110> I'm<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.590> show<00:02:37.770> you

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
main patterns that I'm about to show you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.160 
main patterns that I'm about to show you
are<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:38.430> based<00:02:38.640> off<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.970> cage<00:02:39.150> system<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.990> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
are all based off the cage system if you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.390 
are all based off the cage system if you
don't<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> cage<00:02:40.890> system<00:02:41.100> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
don't know what the cage system is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040 
don't know what the cage system is
please<00:02:41.760> check<00:02:41.940> out<00:02:42.060> my<00:02:42.210> other<00:02:42.330> video<00:02:42.660> lesson

about<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.320> cage<00:02:43.650> system<00:02:43.890> where<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.220> explain<00:02:44.460> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
about the cage system where I explain it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
about the cage system where I explain it
a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:44.790> bit<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.330> detail<00:02:45.590> also<00:02:46.590> keep<00:02:46.770> in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
a little bit more in detail also keep in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.140 
a little bit more in detail also keep in
mind<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> fingerings<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.000> i'm<00:02:48.120> using

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
mind that the fingerings that i'm using

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.200 
mind that the fingerings that i'm using
are<00:02:48.690> all<00:02:49.680> open<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.190> interpretation<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:51.060> when

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
are all open to interpretation so when

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.520 
are all open to interpretation so when
you<00:02:51.270> watch<00:02:51.450> me<00:02:51.630> play<00:02:51.870> these<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.290> don't

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you watch me play these you don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.930 
you watch me play these you don't
necessarily<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.130> play<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> same<00:02:53.760> way

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
necessarily have to play in the same way

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.700 
necessarily have to play in the same way
when<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.270> play<00:02:54.510> pentatonix<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> tend<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> ignore

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
when I play pentatonix I tend to ignore

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.590 
when I play pentatonix I tend to ignore
the<00:02:56.070> pinkie<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:56.700> bit<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.000> only<00:02:57.390> play

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
the pinkie a little bit and only play

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.080 
the pinkie a little bit and only play
with<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:57.900> first<00:02:58.170> second<00:02:58.560> third<00:02:58.620> finger<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.310> get

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
with my first second third finger I get

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.190 
with my first second third finger I get
a<00:03:00.120> little<00:03:00.210> bit<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.480> speed<00:03:00.750> out<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.170> that

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
a little bit more speed out of it that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.870 
a little bit more speed out of it that
way<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:01.530> again<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.190> open<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.670> what's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
way but again it's all open to what's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.490 
way but again it's all open to what's
comfortable<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.480> under<00:03:04.290> your

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
comfortable and under your

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.320 
comfortable and under your
interpretation<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> basically<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.180> let's

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
interpretation of it basically so let's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.280 
interpretation of it basically so let's
go<00:03:06.420> ahead<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.570> start<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> off<00:03:06.990> by<00:03:07.020> pattern<00:03:07.470> one

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.520 

moving<00:03:13.099> on<00:03:13.219> a<00:03:13.250> pattern<00:03:13.579> to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.180 

in<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.760> fatty<00:03:19.030> three

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.800 

pattern<00:03:24.190> or

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.370 

you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.449 
you
and<00:03:29.160> finally<00:03:29.520> pattern<00:03:29.820> 5

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.500 

alright<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.640> that's<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.030> all<00:03:36.300> five

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
alright so that's it for all five

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.120 
alright so that's it for all five
patterns<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.080> major<00:03:37.260> pentatonic<00:03:37.590> let's

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
patterns of the major pentatonic let's

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
patterns of the major pentatonic let's
go<00:03:38.250> ahead<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.430> take<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.640> look<00:03:38.760> at<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> minor

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
go ahead and take a look at the minor

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.650 
go ahead and take a look at the minor
pentatonic<00:03:39.330> now<00:03:40.970> all<00:03:41.970> right<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.360> what<00:03:42.510> makes

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
pentatonic now all right so what makes

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.180 
pentatonic now all right so what makes
up<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.930> minor<00:03:43.110> pentatonic<00:03:43.290> scale<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
up the minor pentatonic scale the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.410 
up the minor pentatonic scale the
following<00:03:44.640> five<00:03:44.790> notes<00:03:45.440> your<00:03:46.440> root<00:03:46.680> G<00:03:47.420> your

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
your interpretation you don't have to

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.360 
your interpretation you don't have to
play<00:04:12.720> them<00:04:12.840> exactly<00:04:13.080> like<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.560> do<00:04:13.620> let's<00:04:14.250> go

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
play them exactly like I do let's go

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.900 
play them exactly like I do let's go
ahead<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.519> take<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.700> look<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:14.970> pattern<00:04:15.239> one

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.800 

and<00:04:20.120> pattern<00:04:21.050> to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:36.080 

pattern<00:04:26.740> 3<00:04:30.720> pattern<00:04:31.720> for

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.619 

and<00:04:36.690> finally<00:04:37.139> pattern<00:04:37.440> five

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.820 

so<00:04:42.629> that's<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:43.020> all<00:04:43.259> five<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.560> those

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
so that's it for all five of those

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.740 
so that's it for all five of those
patterns<00:04:44.129> again<00:04:44.550> everybody<00:04:45.389> already

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
patterns again everybody already

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.510 
patterns again everybody already
typically<00:04:46.289> knows<00:04:46.470> pattern<00:04:46.889> for<00:04:47.129> that's<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
typically knows pattern for that's the

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.490 
typically knows pattern for that's the
one<00:04:47.819> that<00:04:48.000> everybody<00:04:48.330> learns<00:04:48.780> first<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.410> then

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
one that everybody learns first and then

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.559 
one that everybody learns first and then
some<00:04:49.740> people<00:04:49.860> even<00:04:50.129> learn<00:04:50.370> pattern<00:04:50.759> too<00:04:50.940> but

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
some people even learn pattern too but

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.909 
some people even learn pattern too but
now<00:04:51.780> what<00:04:52.020> I'm<00:04:52.139> going<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.319> show<00:04:52.409> you<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.889> a

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
now what I'm going to show you is a

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.860 
now what I'm going to show you is a
couple<00:04:53.159> of<00:04:53.400> ways<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.360> take<00:04:54.539> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
couple of ways that you can take the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.779 
couple of ways that you can take the
knowledge<00:04:55.289> about<00:04:55.830> what<00:04:56.129> goes<00:04:56.370> into<00:04:56.639> the

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
knowledge about what goes into the

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.580 
knowledge about what goes into the
pentatonic<00:04:57.150> scale<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.840> get<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.229> little<00:04:58.470> bit

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
pentatonic scale and get a little bit

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.050 
pentatonic scale and get a little bit
more<00:04:58.710> mileage<00:04:58.949> out<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.490> with<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.669> couple<00:05:00.000> of

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
more mileage out of it with a couple of

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.200 
more mileage out of it with a couple of
different<00:05:01.039> different<00:05:02.039> ways<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.759> playing<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
different different ways of playing the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.350 
different different ways of playing the
pentatonic<00:05:03.569> scale<00:05:04.789> alright<00:05:05.789> so<00:05:05.909> these<00:05:06.030> next

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
pentatonic scale alright so these next

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.550 
pentatonic scale alright so these next
few<00:05:06.479> scales<00:05:06.690> i'm<00:05:06.960> going<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.139> show<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.319> or

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
few scales i'm going to show you or

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.409 
few scales i'm going to show you or
what's<00:05:07.740> called<00:05:07.830> extended<00:05:08.639> pentatonic<00:05:09.180> scales

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
what's called extended pentatonic scales

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.210 
what's called extended pentatonic scales
and<00:05:09.629> what<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:09.960> means<00:05:10.199> is<00:05:10.379> we're<00:05:10.620> taking<00:05:10.800> bits

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and what that means is we're taking bits

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.249 
and what that means is we're taking bits
and<00:05:11.430> pieces<00:05:11.789> of<00:05:11.819> all<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.389> five<00:05:12.599> pentatonic

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
and pieces of all the five pentatonic

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.050 
and pieces of all the five pentatonic
boxes<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.889> stream<00:05:14.280> them<00:05:14.520> together<00:05:14.849> to<00:05:14.940> form

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
boxes and stream them together to form

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.839 
boxes and stream them together to form
one<00:05:15.330> long<00:05:15.870> flowing<00:05:16.229> line<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.860> what<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.669> can

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
one long flowing line and what that can

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.700 
one long flowing line and what that can
do<00:05:18.090> is<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.810> either<00:05:19.020> add<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.259> little<00:05:19.530> bit

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
do is that can either add a little bit

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.480 
do is that can either add a little bit
of<00:05:19.770> flare<00:05:20.220> or<00:05:20.580> more<00:05:21.509> melodic<00:05:21.930> feel<00:05:22.409> to<00:05:22.740> some<00:05:23.370> of

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
of flare or more melodic feel to some of

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.580 
of flare or more melodic feel to some of
your<00:05:23.610> lines<00:05:23.909> because<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.780> tend<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.169> use<00:05:25.380> these

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
your lines because you tend to use these

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.430 
your lines because you tend to use these
a<00:05:25.650> little<00:05:25.919> bit<00:05:26.130> more<00:05:26.310> legato<00:05:27.139> meaning<00:05:28.139> a<00:05:28.229> lot

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
a little bit more legato meaning a lot

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.620 
a little bit more legato meaning a lot
of<00:05:28.620> hammer-ons<00:05:29.130> pull-offs<00:05:29.280> slides<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.330> sort

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
of hammer-ons pull-offs slides that sort

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.350 
of hammer-ons pull-offs slides that sort
of<00:05:30.690> thing<00:05:30.830> or<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.669> can<00:05:32.880> use<00:05:32.909> these<00:05:33.330> as

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
of thing or you can use these as

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.330 
of thing or you can use these as
transitions<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.409> quickly<00:05:34.770> move<00:05:34.919> from<00:05:35.130> one

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
transitions to quickly move from one

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.790 
transitions to quickly move from one
area<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:35.759> neck<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:35.969> the<00:05:36.210> next<00:05:36.659> without<00:05:37.409> really

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
area the neck to the next without really

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.619 
area the neck to the next without really
having<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.729> worry<00:05:38.969> about<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.300> few<00:05:39.599> different

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
having to worry about a few different

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.450 
having to worry about a few different
scale<00:05:40.139> patterns<00:05:40.560> because<00:05:40.740> it's<00:05:40.889> all<00:05:41.069> one

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
scale patterns because it's all one

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.089 
scale patterns because it's all one
thing<00:05:41.819> it's<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.569> same<00:05:42.810> five<00:05:43.139> notes<00:05:43.169> basically

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
thing it's the same five notes basically

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.709 
thing it's the same five notes basically
just<00:05:44.280> kind<00:05:44.490> of<00:05:44.580> repeated<00:05:45.030> in<00:05:45.180> octaves<00:05:45.630> and

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
just kind of repeated in octaves and

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.170 
just kind of repeated in octaves and
then<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.110> go<00:05:46.289> back<00:05:46.469> down<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:46.940> there's<00:05:47.940> two

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
then you can go back down so there's two

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.580 
then you can go back down so there's two
different<00:05:48.389> types<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.960> these<00:05:49.139> there's<00:05:49.409> one

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
different types of these there's one

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.839 
different types of these there's one
that<00:05:49.710> starts<00:05:49.979> on<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:50.099> sixth<00:05:50.430> string<00:05:50.460> there's

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
that starts on the sixth string there's

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.279 
that starts on the sixth string there's
one<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.150> starts<00:05:51.419> on<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.599> fifth<00:05:51.840> string<00:05:51.900> and

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
one that starts on the fifth string and

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.689 
one that starts on the fifth string and
then<00:05:52.409> there's<00:05:52.590> major<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.099> minor<00:05:53.280> for<00:05:53.580> each

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
then there's major and minor for each

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.850 
then there's major and minor for each
one<00:05:54.000> so<00:05:54.509> let's<00:05:54.690> go<00:05:54.840> ahead<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.110> take<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.380> look<00:05:55.650> at

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
one so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.620 
one so let's go ahead and take a look at
the<00:05:56.130> major<00:05:56.310> ones<00:05:56.669> first<00:05:56.909> and<00:05:57.210> then<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.419> minor

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
the major ones first and then the minor

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.209 
the major ones first and then the minor
ones<00:05:57.900> starting<00:05:58.349> with<00:05:58.469> the<00:05:58.590> six<00:05:58.830> string<00:05:59.039> root

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
ones starting with the six string root

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:08.250 
ones starting with the six string root
major

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.410 

alright<00:06:09.250> so<00:06:09.490> now<00:06:09.670> let's<00:06:09.910> go<00:06:10.030> ahead<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.270> look

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
alright so now let's go ahead and look

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.820 
alright so now let's go ahead and look
at<00:06:10.540> major<00:06:10.810> with<00:06:11.170> starting<00:06:11.470> on<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.620> fifth

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
at major with starting on the fifth

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:21.580 
at major with starting on the fifth
string
