00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:13.514
The trolleybus arrived, the first door opened...

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.855
I had the gift bag with cookies for the driver, 
 I got in, knocked to the driver window...

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:23.893
We had trouble with sticking the “Christmas Trolleybus” sign,because 
 the tape wouldn’t stick to wet window surface.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.674
But a couple of wonderful Vilnius people helped us!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.034
I was responsible for the music so I 
 had a big player in my hands,

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:43.375
and played all the Christmas songs that I collected for the purpose.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.274
I thought that I was really bored of them because I’d 
 have listened for them for a couple of days..

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:54.729
But when I started playing them in the trolleybus - it was really 
 fun again! because I was sharing it with the other people.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.740
Everybody started to wonder what’s happenning..

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.722
Music started playing loudly..

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.251
On the next stop a couple of passengers got on the trolley..

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.827
At the time I was sticking a snowflake to the window..

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:14.188
Suddenly, a person started decorating too! And then I thought “this is amazing!”

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
In this way, on every stop people got in, decorate, got out..

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.790
The number of people got bigger and smaller..

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.423
..and we all really felt the wonderful Christmas mood.

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:34.621
It was really nice moment when we got to the first stop..

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:41.120
A girl that was sitting aside me stood up and started decorating..

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.600
I was really surprized even though I knew it was going to happen!

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:49.740
..I thought that she was a regular passenger!

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:58.050
And.. the most surprizing moment..

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.120
On Kudirka bus stop..

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:05.690
People got a present!

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:10.890
With loud voice saying “ohoho”..

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.030
..Santa Claus got on the trolley!

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:16.610
I was Santa Claus in this mission,

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:21.630
My task was to get on the trolley 
 in Kudirka stop and surprize the passengers.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:26.840
This is after the trolley have been decorated by socmob participants.

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.870
Wow! That’s what I was thinking!

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:41.980
Because it was all decorated very nicely .. and I was really surprized!

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:45.330
and the mood in the trolley was amazing!

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:51.170
When I got on the trolley I made my voice very low..

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.170
..and congratuated everyone with Christmas.

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.070
I asked people to say a few lines 
 about Christmas or to sing a song.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.650
Some of them did just that.

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:06.550
I cared about the trolley and that it would be docorated nicely.

00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:12.400
“Very beautiful, very fun, such a nice trolley! I’m surprized!”

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:14.540
“Would you like a present?”

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:16.140
“Well, what’s for the present?”

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:18.830
“Coockies... from Lapland!”

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:19.670
"Thank you"

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:27.610
[Girl reciting lines about Christmas]

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.420
".. and so on. I don’t remember it all!"

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:37.020
"That’s ok, you don’t have to! It’s Christmas time!"

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:38.310
“Are you wating for Christmas?”

00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:39.150
“Yes we are”

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.520
“Show us how you do it”

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:43.790
“.. I don’t know how to sing!”

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.180
"Merry Christmas!"

00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:13.380
We went towards the Christmas tree standing in Cathedral square..

00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:18.950
..and started another Chirstmas show!

00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:56.700
“We wish you a merry Christmas.. ” x 3

00:04:56.705 --> 00:05:00.300
".. and happy New Year!"

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:15.830
“When we got on the trolley all tipsy and saw all this, “

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.250
“..we had wonderful moments!”

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.110
“We were like.. let’s take a picture here and there..”

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:22.460
“.. near the monitor and the glass.”

00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:26.640
We got such Christmas mood  that we thought “Let’s do it again!”

00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:27.800
“It was sooo good!”

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:31.460
And the whole trolley was singing “We wish 
 you a merry Christmas..”. It was good.
