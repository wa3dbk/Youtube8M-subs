videos to come up with that some of

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.010 
videos to come up with that some of
these<00:01:14.560> other<00:01:14.770> videos<00:01:14.890> are<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:15.600> 70<00:01:16.600> 80<00:01:16.780> or<00:01:16.990> a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
these other videos are like 70 80 or a

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.780 
these other videos are like 70 80 or a
hundred<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.770> can<00:01:17.950> imagine<00:01:18.040> if<00:01:18.520> it's<00:01:18.700> a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
hundred so you can imagine if it's a

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.660 
hundred so you can imagine if it's a
hundred<00:01:18.940> as<00:01:19.450> 28<00:01:19.870> and<00:01:19.960> it's<00:01:20.049> taken<00:01:20.409> over<00:01:20.670> two

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
hundred as 28 and it's taken over two

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.310 
hundred as 28 and it's taken over two
hours<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.390> thing<00:01:22.600> says<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.960> get<00:01:23.110> one

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
hours so this thing says to get one

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.980 
hours so this thing says to get one
little<00:01:23.740> video<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.370> unless<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.240> gets<00:01:25.570> fixed

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990
