00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.540 

it's<00:03:43.110> comparable<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.190> one's<00:03:44.400> that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
it's comparable it's this one's that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.580 
it's comparable it's this one's that
it's<00:03:45.180> actually<00:03:45.330> thin<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.260> think<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:46.440> an

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
it's actually thin it's I think it's an

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
it's actually thin it's I think it's an
11<00:03:46.890> millimeter<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.760> 11<00:03:48.000> or<00:03:48.090> 12<00:03:48.240> millimeters

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
11 millimeter it's 11 or 12 millimeters

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.690 
11 millimeter it's 11 or 12 millimeters
let<00:03:48.810> me<00:03:48.900> double-check<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:49.890> it's<00:03:50.460> got

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
let me double-check on that but it's got

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
let me double-check on that but it's got
a<00:03:50.730> great<00:03:50.970> streamlined<00:03:51.510> feel<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.350> can

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
a great streamlined feel in it and I can

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.580 
a great streamlined feel in it and I can
I<00:03:52.710> can<00:03:52.950> actually<00:03:53.220> pull<00:03:53.400> out<00:03:53.550> my<00:03:54.060> lumia<00:03:54.990> 800

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
I can actually pull out my lumia 800

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.650 
I can actually pull out my lumia 800
here<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.730> as<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.180> we'll<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.480> kind

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
here so as you can see we'll just kind

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.910 
here so as you can see we'll just kind
of<00:03:57.750> will<00:03:57.930> kind<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.140> stack<00:03:58.380> them<00:03:58.530> together<00:03:58.620> and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
of will kind of stack them together and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.410 
of will kind of stack them together and
you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.550> it's<00:03:59.790> pretty<00:04:00.030> comparable

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
you can see it's it's pretty comparable

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.880 
you can see it's it's pretty comparable
it<00:04:00.600> still<00:04:00.840> fits<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.110> very<00:04:01.320> thin<00:04:01.560> device

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
it still fits a very thin device

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.740 
it still fits a very thin device
obviously<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.940> look<00:04:03.060> at<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.270> from<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.480> sides

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
obviously we look at it from the sides

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.840 
obviously we look at it from the sides
again<00:04:04.290> pretty<00:04:04.770> much<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.100> same<00:04:05.280> right<00:04:05.580> there

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
again pretty much the same right there

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.680 
again pretty much the same right there
great<00:04:06.510> build<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:08.240> it<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.570> bit

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
great build on it it is a little bit

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.820 
great build on it it is a little bit
longer<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.470> screen<00:04:10.650> this

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
longer to it because of the screen this

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.800 
longer to it because of the screen this
one<00:04:11.010> obviously<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.460> 800<00:04:11.850> with<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> with<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
one obviously the 800 with the with the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
one obviously the 800 with the with the
3.7<00:04:13.530> inch<00:04:13.650> screen<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.460> actually<00:04:14.670> has<00:04:14.940> that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
3.7 inch screen this actually has that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.780 
3.7 inch screen this actually has that
4.3<00:04:15.900> inch<00:04:16.080> screen<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.460> you<00:04:17.520> get<00:04:17.730> a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
4.3 inch screen on it so you get a

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.910 
4.3 inch screen on it so you get a
little<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.210> space<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> play<00:04:18.810> with<00:04:19.050> their<00:04:19.290> see
