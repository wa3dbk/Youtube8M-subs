it comes out of the dye pot which makes

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
it comes out of the dye pot which makes
it<00:03:04.350> fun<00:03:06.440> not<00:03:07.440> anything<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.220> repeat<00:03:08.610> very

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
middle but it sure is a fun way to die

middle but it sure is a fun way to die
well<00:03:14.190> II<00:03:14.220> did<00:03:14.459> use<00:03:14.640> all<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.970> blue<00:03:17.330> now<00:03:18.330> I'm

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
well II did use all the blue now I'm

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.500 
well II did use all the blue now I'm
going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:20.070> tap<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.610> down<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.270> bit<00:03:21.390> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
going to just tap it down a little bit I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.600 
going to just tap it down a little bit I
don't<00:03:21.660> want<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.080> stir<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.380> around<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:23.070> tap<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
don't want to stir it around just tap it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.560 
don't want to stir it around just tap it
down<00:03:25.010> if<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.580> locks<00:03:26.820> are<00:03:27.150> still<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
down if some of the locks are still a

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.620 
down if some of the locks are still a
little<00:03:27.780> bit<00:03:27.930> white<00:03:28.320> that's<00:03:29.040> fine

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.330 

because<00:03:33.630> there<00:03:33.840> isn't<00:03:34.019> as<00:03:34.320> much<00:03:34.350> water<00:03:34.890> in

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
because there isn't as much water in

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.420 
because there isn't as much water in
here<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:37.200> want<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.800> fry<00:03:38.070> when<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
here I don't want this to fry when I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.509 
here I don't want this to fry when I
microwave<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.780> I'm<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.200> cover<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.650> with

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
microwave so I'm going to cover it with

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.340 
microwave so I'm going to cover it with
plastic<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:44.310> plastic<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.269> I'm<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:46.080> going

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
plastic the plastic is on I'm not going

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.110 
plastic the plastic is on I'm not going
to<00:03:46.440> seal<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.920> real<00:03:47.190> tight<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.820> couple

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to seal it real tight for a couple

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.420 
to seal it real tight for a couple
reasons<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.630> steam<00:03:48.900> will<00:03:49.110> build<00:03:49.920> up<00:03:50.160> inside

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
reasons the steam will build up inside

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.479 
reasons the steam will build up inside
the<00:03:51.230> other<00:03:52.230> than<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> take<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.100> out<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
the other than when I take it out and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.550 
the other than when I take it out and
remove<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.060> plastic<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.050> be<00:03:55.170> very

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
remove the plastic you have to be very

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.650 
remove the plastic you have to be very
very<00:03:55.920> careful<00:03:56.160> because<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.820> gets<00:03:57.060> scalding

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
very careful because it gets scalding

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.539 
very careful because it gets scalding
hot<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.650> burn<00:03:59.040> yourself

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
hot and you can really burn yourself

wool<00:05:16.050> so<00:05:17.050> I'm<00:05:17.169> letting<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> water<00:05:17.710> run<00:05:17.919> over

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
wool so I'm letting the water run over

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.210 
wool so I'm letting the water run over
my<00:05:18.610> hands<00:05:21.450> if<00:05:22.450> there<00:05:22.720> was<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.870> lot<00:05:23.169> of<00:05:23.200> color<00:05:23.620> in

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
my hands if there was a lot of color in

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.040 
my hands if there was a lot of color in
this<00:05:24.940> water<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:27.370> would<00:05:27.580> mean<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.660> dull<00:05:28.840> I

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
this water it would mean that the dull I

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.820 
this water it would mean that the dull I
hadn't<00:05:29.470> all<00:05:29.650> been<00:05:29.919> taken<00:05:30.340> up<00:05:30.490> into<00:05:30.729> the<00:05:31.000> wool

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
hadn't all been taken up into the wool

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.540 
hadn't all been taken up into the wool
that<00:05:32.830> could<00:05:33.039> be<00:05:33.220> caused<00:05:34.150> by<00:05:35.020> not<00:05:35.430> heating<00:05:36.430> it

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
that could be caused by not heating it

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.390 
that could be caused by not heating it
long<00:05:36.760> enough<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.800> wasn't<00:05:39.190> hot<00:05:39.370> enough

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
long enough so that it wasn't hot enough

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.790 
long enough so that it wasn't hot enough
for<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.030> dye<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.330> take<00:05:40.690> not<00:05:41.169> using<00:05:41.590> enough

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
for the dye to take not using enough

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.940 
for the dye to take not using enough
vinegar<00:05:42.039> which<00:05:42.970> sets<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.570> dye<00:05:43.750> or<00:05:44.470> simply

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
vinegar which sets the dye or simply

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.940 
vinegar which sets the dye or simply
using<00:05:45.400> too<00:05:45.669> much<00:05:45.940> dye<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:46.840> there<00:05:47.380> was<00:05:47.530> no<00:05:47.740> way

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
using too much dye and there was no way

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.600 
using too much dye and there was no way
the<00:05:48.220> wool<00:05:48.430> could<00:05:48.940> absorb<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.479> all<00:05:50.400> if<00:05:51.400> you

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
the wool could absorb it all if you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.860 
the wool could absorb it all if you
don't<00:05:51.850> rinse<00:05:52.210> off<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:53.500> excess<00:05:53.979> dye<00:05:54.870> when

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
don't rinse off the excess dye when

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.480 
don't rinse off the excess dye when
you're<00:05:56.020> spinning<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.770> will<00:05:56.919> come<00:05:57.100> off<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.280> your
