00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Well to all of the guys here who talks to you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.589
 it's today I 'm here with the tutorial for 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.540
 reg lists 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.189
 in a single origins player 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
 I want to clarify that the first step 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.330
 we will sing immediately I have already explained it is not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
 target beat and upgrade i 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 so you won't be able to explain if 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
 you want to see it I invent the leak if 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.619
 you want pressure from that video so no 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.660
 you need the values ​​to explain 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 it's about that video maybe even though 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320
 after detailed jp of what you play 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 the game 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 so more to ensure you're there 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 your sticks is close to work that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 for those who don't know, take it with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.500
 this little stone that we find in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.500
 3 2 cinema to take her to the church 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.390
 this point must be inserted into the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.309
 church and kills a certain quality of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.719
 zombie with fist and I recommend you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 actually doing it was a low because 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 you could end up like me has 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 really a great danger in particular 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
 in single quite risky maybe 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 a beautiful shield and the trout instance and so much 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.469
 that convenient 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.989
 after that you have to take this up again 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 stone and bring it back to the point of before 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.070
 without exploiting it in doing so 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 simply think of the tank 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.930
 in this way and then wait for that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.060
 rode report ii and place it such e 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 after 2 proceed another certain part of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 zombies if you do as my case 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.670
 is grouped of all together with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 stabbing anyone as comfortable as what 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.689
 because you don't need to kill them 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.369
 while they spong out that though there 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 shocked if everyone regroups later 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.670
 together quite dangerous because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 they could close without problems 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 so you see a nice stick like that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 some rapid wind came out of then 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.310
 if you are shooting yourself and then you will have to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.710
 do the monkeys without too much trouble 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 napalm and after these preparations 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.829
 we can start lists reguera e 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 just then the first step 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.810
 next and sticks is to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.430
 insert them into the robots this case of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 three low nicolò of the wind will go 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.149
 inserted into the central robot 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.689
 in fact it is called odino or the god 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.710
 of the wind 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.970
 then we will have to put in the robot of the 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.579
 of the generator hangar 2 that does 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.140
 oli or of the small and will be called thor 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.210
 then the stick sees how serious it will be 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.300
 that of lightning and lastly that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.460
 the church will be called 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.440
 I think it 's paul col and we should 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.780
 insert the ice stick into it 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.850
 while the last brick or that one 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.770
 some fire will be inserted there will be a 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 extra pedestal in the area of ​​the is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.980
 state and where i 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.020
 sticks but will be putting them a lot 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.610
 simple as things I would like to point out that 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.680
 this step maybe one of the most 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.990
 long as regards the wait because 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.670
 the robots really do come a few times 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.430
 wait for them really long so 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.780
 arm yourself with patience 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.950
 after which we have the longest passage 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.540
 and stressful in the individual's play 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 in fact, don't let me make it a round 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.630
 really hallucinating 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.150
 the passage would cost in pressing the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.400
 button and then throw the bomb at the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.140
 palm in the area where there is a great deal 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.090
 makeup is the single really is 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.380
 difficult to have absurd timing 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.120
 therefore we thus expect the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.400
 counter of the expulsion of the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.860
 player arrives at one or even zero 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.750
 who carlo run and throw one 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.570
 grateful to the amount even enough 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.890
 well the case I spun big time 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.410
 this because because in reality the two 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.030
 players or more you would do that one 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.710
 for many ways ahead to launch 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.070
 well in single this thing cannot be done 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.920
 do 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.390
 so if you know how to make us exit that in 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.090
 instead two or three attempts are put into 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 I play 50 attempts to make you understand 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.380
 in fact waited allows a phase of 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.970
 absurd time made so many far 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.020
 get out other ammunition 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.550
 so know that if you don't know 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.190
 do in single you can put yourself 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.620
 really a long time after creating 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.230
 this hole in the ground sending you inside 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.840
 the maxis drone this will allow to do 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 exit at about one neighboring of 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.520
 panzer that type five or six if not 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.260
 I'm wrong so if you don't have good weapons 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.790
 don't take this step I had the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.590
 ice stick and brookings 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.989
 so it wasn't even too much 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.180
 worrying because in any case the pats 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.739
 Actually usual type prof dem petico 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.510
 first less then maybe and grouped 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.270
 together in braking a calculation of brutes 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.709
 you killed them even if you are around 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.570
 enough tuccio because in the lives of 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.480
 fans I'm not mistaken which one pulls 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.160
 so just be careful and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.360
 kill them you don't have to have either 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.240
 too many problems also because vi 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.130
 will leave some maccari bonuses 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.810
 the next step will have to be done 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.050
 with a zombie blood you will have to find a 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.370
 sure plane in flight that you will see it all 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.500
 of red as if it were that of 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.720
 fire pastor you owe 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.030
 destroy it precisely and after doing 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.500
 this network to find a zombie around 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.090
 to the excavation site that is this point here 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.650
 where the pat is the rest e 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.510
 kill him and understand that the right one 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 because it will leave you a max thriller of one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.510
 botta known then first day 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.310
 which I saw does not figure in the association 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.660
 del maxxi if you need san 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.760
 maurizio weigh the trick of 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.320
 turn off the new wagons as if 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.360
 pits to enhance the ice and 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.700
 you will find one always aligned a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.100
 note of the next apache pack 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.900
 step consists in killing one 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.720
 certain how much of zomer I think about one 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.000
 thirty with the tender punch for the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.470
 our beautiful dark here guys this is the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.350
 why you really need to do it 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.110
 low because it focused a great 41 that the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.970
 zombies died in roughly I don't know 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.640
 will have been pleased with the of 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.320
 absurd stab wounds so make me like it 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.970
 so will ask a customer so monotype in 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.040
 four shots because really there 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.730
 you will really put up and see 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.800
 this bonus which kind of stipulate one 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.900
 cream used before to make the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.120
 napalm monkeys and could have accomplished 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.690
 from this passage 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.130
 the last step consists 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.530
 when inserting all your sticks 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.420
 again in the crisis place and kill 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.730
 about fifty zombies 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.680
 another reason why this thing will vote 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.740
 a hard low if you know it yes 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.200
 will hold a 29 you made easter egg up 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.150
 here the punch that you will have shutter again 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.220
 succeeded until type were 35 if not 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.810
 mistake the power very similar to that 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.640
 of that to the new the dead 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.410
 so then you should n't have this 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.720
 kind of problem 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.400
 well guys this was the goal like 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.120
 you know after doing all this snoq 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.500
 network 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.970
 the whole area is powerful bass crisis 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.620
 turn quietly like I did 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.990
 for ignoring 87 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.220
 I hope this can be senseless 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.840
 however, I advise you to do these in 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.580
 multi- player series because it is more 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.320
 simple and you will really help less 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.940
 time to wait for the robots the part 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.390
 longer and more players is much more 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.820
 simple 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.010
 I wish you good killings anyway 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.480
 goal with the rounds anyway because 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.250
 however, they do now even if this one 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.540
 lie is very slow see you guys 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.540
 to the next beautiful video
