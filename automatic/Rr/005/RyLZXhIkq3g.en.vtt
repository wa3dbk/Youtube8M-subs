00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.850
 hello that such friends I'm from drammen and I'm going 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.129
 to explain very briefly a 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.339
 technique that is very useful for routines 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:16.160
 sad that I hope you are putting together your 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.460
 sets to present it until 3 of 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.980
 March that there is very little so one of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.150
 the most effective routines 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.519
 last year in the chicago crystal 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.509
 it was this technique called tom play that is 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.920
 convert with notes of a song put together 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.589
 the melody of another song 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 it's not that easy to find songs 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.030
 that have the same tones but 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 looking and looking for one can find 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 your own tricks here I'm going to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.329
 show a trick that I put together from 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.420
 a conception of norbert presence that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.969
 it's called girl girl 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.339
 here I will show you that with only 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.460
 with the laptop buttons I can put together 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.089
 a trick that with the dais is also with 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.600
 another control I can do better 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.000
 way 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 to create how easy it is but how 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 complicated also you can suddenly suddenly 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.740
 find a song that has ringtones 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740
 another time 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.229
 well now the trick part comes 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
 well you can put together a melody that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.950
 It can be quite effective during the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.289
 contest present your sets dare with 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.890
 your technical tests and see you in the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.969
 tri style this 3d do not forget this 3 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 March is due 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.090
