then<00:03:54.599> let's<00:03:54.900> travel<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.380> world<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.889> just

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
then let's travel this world so you just

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.379 
then let's travel this world so you just
right<00:03:56.280> click<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.639> it<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:56.880> then<00:03:57.030> click<00:03:57.269> this

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
right click on it and then click this

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.440 
right click on it and then click this
little<00:03:57.599> black<00:03:57.870> area<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.880> may<00:04:00.090> lag<00:04:00.419> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
little black area and it may lag a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.949 
little black area and it may lag a
little<00:04:00.750> bit<00:04:01.169> but<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.709> will<00:04:01.829> bring<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.489> your

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
little bit but it will bring you to your

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.920 
little bit but it will bring you to your
age<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.319> diamond<00:04:04.829> or<00:04:04.950> tendrils<00:04:08.359> now<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.569> can<00:04:09.780> be

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
age of diamond or tendrils now it can be

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.720 
age of diamond or tendrils now it can be
very<00:04:10.139> laggy<00:04:10.410> when<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.980> first<00:04:11.250> load<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.609> up

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
very laggy when you first load it up

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.520 
very laggy when you first load it up
it's<00:04:11.940> going<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> have<00:04:12.269> random<00:04:12.569> stuff<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.349> as

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
it's going to have random stuff so as

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.229 
it's going to have random stuff so as
you<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.739> see<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.310> have<00:04:14.489> an<00:04:14.700> orange

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
you can see I think we have an orange

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.550 
you can see I think we have an orange
sky<00:04:15.630> or<00:04:15.900> something<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.289> that

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
sky or something like that

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.360 
sky or something like that
it's<00:04:17.430> very<00:04:17.700> weird<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.700> will<00:04:21.060> work<00:04:21.359> so

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
it's very weird but it it will work so

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.080 
it's very weird but it it will work so
here<00:04:24.180> we<00:04:24.270> go<00:04:24.660> as<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:25.320> can<00:04:25.410> see<00:04:25.850> diamond<00:04:26.850> or

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
here we go as you can see diamond or

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.120 
here we go as you can see diamond or
forever<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:29.190> will<00:04:29.220> never<00:04:29.729> need<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.630> go<00:04:31.440> caving

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
forever you will never need to go caving

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.510 
forever you will never need to go caving
again<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.419> role<00:04:33.720> at<00:04:34.310> apparently<00:04:35.310> there

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
again in this role at apparently there

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.610 
again in this role at apparently there
are<00:04:35.550> some<00:04:35.820> negative<00:04:36.270> effects<00:04:36.750> as<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.169> can<00:04:37.410> see

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
are some negative effects as you can see

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.219 
are some negative effects as you can see
there's<00:04:37.800> mine<00:04:38.130> fatigue<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.790> blindness<00:04:39.330> those

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
there's mine fatigue and blindness those

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.370 
there's mine fatigue and blindness those
aren't<00:04:40.590> very<00:04:40.620> great<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:42.479> does<00:04:42.840> kind<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.110> suck

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
aren't very great this does kind of suck

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.830 
aren't very great this does kind of suck
but<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.639> keep<00:04:44.880> trying<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.360> make<00:04:45.570> more

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
but you can keep trying to make more

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.110 
but you can keep trying to make more
worlds<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.500> are<00:04:46.620> more<00:04:46.770> stable<00:04:46.889> because<00:04:47.880> in

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
worlds that are more stable because in

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480 
worlds that are more stable because in
mist<00:04:48.360> craft<00:04:48.630> when<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.900> create<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.199> world<00:04:49.490> that

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
mist craft when you create a world that

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.659 
mist craft when you create a world that
has<00:04:50.940> such<00:04:51.479> good<00:04:51.750> things<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:52.440> most<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.370> time

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
has such good things it most of the time

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.909 
has such good things it most of the time
will<00:04:53.850> be<00:04:54.000> very<00:04:54.030> unstable<00:04:54.720> another<00:04:55.650> thing

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
will be very unstable another thing

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.290 
will be very unstable another thing
you're<00:04:56.039> going<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> want<00:04:56.400> to<00:04:56.430> watch<00:04:56.610> out<00:04:56.850> for<00:04:57.060> is

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
you're going to want to watch out for is

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.110 
you're going to want to watch out for is
the<00:04:57.600> purple<00:04:58.500> stuff<00:04:58.650> it's<00:04:59.070> like<00:04:59.160> corruption<00:04:59.669> if

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the purple stuff it's like corruption if

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.840 
the purple stuff it's like corruption if
you've<00:05:00.840> ever<00:05:01.020> played<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.770> what's<00:05:02.699> called

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
you've ever played on what's called

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.550 
you've ever played on what's called
terraria<00:05:03.449> and<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> corruption<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
terraria and the corruption the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.439 
terraria and the corruption the
corruption<00:05:04.979> will<00:05:05.130> spread<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.760> eventually

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
corruption will spread and eventually

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.659 
corruption will spread and eventually
eat<00:05:07.020> up<00:05:07.169> your<00:05:07.410> diamond<00:05:08.039> door<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.400> you're<00:05:08.490> going

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
eat up your diamond door so you're going

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.510 
eat up your diamond door so you're going
to<00:05:08.729> want<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.000> try<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.449> make<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:10.160> more<00:05:11.160> stable

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
to want to try and make a more stable

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.520 
to want to try and make a more stable
world<00:05:11.910> in<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.360> craft<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:12.930> kind<00:05:13.199> of<00:05:13.260> hard<00:05:13.470> to

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
world in this craft it's kind of hard to

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.920 
world in this craft it's kind of hard to
explain<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.250> stability<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.820> worlds<00:05:15.360> but

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
explain the stability of worlds but

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.350 
explain the stability of worlds but
anyways<00:05:16.289> this<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.800> how<00:05:16.919> you<00:05:16.979> get<00:05:17.280> diamonds<00:05:18.120> or

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
anyways this is how you get diamonds or

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.159 
anyways this is how you get diamonds or
you<00:05:19.080> know<00:05:19.199> tons<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.949> for<00:05:20.250> free<00:05:20.810> it's<00:05:21.810> very

you know tons of it for free it's very

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.020 
you know tons of it for free it's very
easy<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.800> feed<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.160> beast<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:23.699> pretty

awesome you'll never have a lack of

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.650 
awesome you'll never have a lack of
diamond<00:05:28.050> ever<00:05:28.349> again<00:05:28.830> so<00:05:29.240> okay<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.270> another

diamond ever again so okay so another

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.120 
diamond ever again so okay so another
really<00:05:31.020> quick<00:05:31.139> thing<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.560> forgot<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.979> mention

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
is how to get out of this dimension and

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.370 
is how to get out of this dimension and
back<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:36.000> overworld<00:05:36.539> so<00:05:37.080> you're<00:05:37.200> going<00:05:37.349> to

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
back to the overworld so you're going to

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.659 
back to the overworld so you're going to
want<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.590> do<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.800> take<00:05:38.010> your<00:05:38.130> linking<00:05:38.490> book

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
place it in a book stand so then you

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.510 
place it in a book stand so then you
have<00:05:43.080> your<00:05:43.200> overworld<00:05:43.680> and<00:05:43.919> then<00:05:44.099> just<00:05:44.310> click

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520

on there and you are back to the
overworld<00:05:47.669> that<00:05:48.570> would<00:05:48.690> be<00:05:48.810> very<00:05:49.050> important

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
overworld that would be very important

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.810 
overworld that would be very important
now<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.770> don't<00:05:50.280> want<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.610> lose<00:05:50.789> that
