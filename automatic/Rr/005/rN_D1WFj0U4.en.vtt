few tire tips now these tire tips only
gonna<00:00:39.580> take<00:00:39.730> like<00:00:39.790> five<00:00:40.120> minutes<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.570> your

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.500 

so<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.790> things<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.060> can<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.330> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so now one of the things you can do to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
so now one of the things you can do to
visually<00:00:54.870> inspect<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.470> tires<00:00:55.530> yourself<00:00:56.310> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
visually inspect your tires yourself is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.770 
visually inspect your tires yourself is
what<00:00:56.580> we<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.790> call<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.180> 50<00:00:57.420> cent<00:00:57.600> coin

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
what we like to call the 50 cent coin

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
what we like to call the 50 cent coin
test<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.470> times<00:00:58.830> are<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> bit<00:00:59.190> bad<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.580> all<00:00:59.730> we

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
test now times are a bit bad so all we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
test now times are a bit bad so all we
could<00:00:59.940> come<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.720> 20<00:01:00.960> cents<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
could come up with was 20 cents but it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
could come up with was 20 cents but it
still<00:01:01.920> works<00:01:02.130> because<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.060> to<00:01:03.120> do

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
still works because what you want to do

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.970 
still works because what you want to do
is<00:01:03.450> take<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.750> coin<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.140> put<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:04.890> your

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
is take the coin and put it into your

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.670 
is take the coin and put it into your
thread<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> word<00:01:06.780> sin<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thread now you can see the word sin it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
thread now you can see the word sin it's
time<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> change<00:01:08.160> your<00:01:08.340> tires<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
time to change your tires because that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
time to change your tires because that
means<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.300> tread<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.960> too<00:01:10.020> low<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
means your tread is way too low but you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.650 
means your tread is way too low but you
only<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.550> be<00:01:11.640> able<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
only want to be able to see this is

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.350 
only want to be able to see this is
number<00:01:12.870> 20<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.220> sin<00:01:14.460> change

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
number 20 now you can see sin change

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
number 20 now you can see sin change
your<00:01:15.479> tires<00:01:15.660> now<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.440> most<00:01:16.620> important<00:01:16.890> thing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
your tires now the most important thing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
your tires now the most important thing
about<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.220> tires<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.760> course<00:01:17.970> tire

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
your tires when they are hot add a few

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
your tires when they are hot add a few
psi<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> manufacture<00:01:34.680> recommended<00:01:34.830> tire
