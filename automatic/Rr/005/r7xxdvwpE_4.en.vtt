00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you guys are going to give me enough

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.900 
you guys are going to give me enough
work<00:03:30.870> i'll<00:03:31.560> make<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:33.000> my<00:03:33.150> film

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.580 

wait<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.720> I'm<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:37.930> supposed<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.230> be<00:03:38.320> able<00:03:38.410> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
wait so I'm not supposed to be able to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.380 
wait so I'm not supposed to be able to
clip<00:03:38.770> into<00:03:38.920> those<00:03:39.100> those<00:03:39.460> mountains<00:03:40.270> there

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
clip into those those mountains there

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.330 
clip into those those mountains there
yeah<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.350> mountains<00:03:41.650> if<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.950> weigh<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
yeah the mountains if you weigh in the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.830 
yeah the mountains if you weigh in the
background<00:03:42.730> though<00:03:42.850> they're<00:03:43.000> not<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.360> little

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
background though they're not a little

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.230 
background though they're not a little
too<00:03:43.930> far<00:03:44.110> forward<00:03:44.410> I'm<00:03:44.590> gonna<00:03:44.740> hide<00:03:44.860> down<00:03:45.010> here

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
too far forward I'm gonna hide down here

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.730 
too far forward I'm gonna hide down here
it<00:03:46.240> won't<00:03:46.360> hurt<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.690> though<00:03:46.840> there's<00:03:47.620> no

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
it won't hurt you though there's no

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.680 
it won't hurt you though there's no
collision<00:03:48.130> on<00:03:48.250> them<00:03:48.400> but<00:03:49.150> they<00:03:49.270> won't<00:03:49.450> agree

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
collision on them but they won't agree

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.910 
collision on them but they won't agree
we<00:03:49.960> look<00:03:50.110> at<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.470> coming<00:03:50.680> out<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.800> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
we look at that just coming out of the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.910 
we look at that just coming out of the
mountains<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.310> don't<00:03:51.460> even<00:03:51.520> know<00:03:51.670> what<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.910> is

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
mountains you don't even know what it is

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.730 
mountains you don't even know what it is
the<00:03:53.920> only<00:03:54.130> do<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> can<00:03:54.730> go

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.800 

run<00:04:00.740> right<00:04:01.430> pool<00:04:02.120> cleaning<00:04:02.330> apparatus<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.750> I

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
run right pool cleaning apparatus so I

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.330 
run right pool cleaning apparatus so I
guess<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.170> that's<00:04:06.560> what<00:04:06.860> I'm<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.010> feel<00:04:07.220> like

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
guess that that's what I'm I feel like

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.010 
guess that that's what I'm I feel like
serious<00:04:07.670> questions<00:04:08.270> like<00:04:08.450> how<00:04:08.570> hard<00:04:08.750> was<00:04:08.960> it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
serious questions like how hard was it

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.380 
serious questions like how hard was it
to<00:04:09.170> oh<00:04:09.980> Jesus<00:04:10.790> right<00:04:11.860> yep<00:04:12.860> typical<00:04:13.700> curve<00:04:14.090> I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
to oh Jesus right yep typical curve I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.360 
to oh Jesus right yep typical curve I
guess<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:15.320> know<00:04:15.440> quote<00:04:15.620> uncle<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.010> followed

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
guess you know quote uncle we followed

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.789 
guess you know quote uncle we followed
this<00:04:16.489> tonight<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.299> dick<00:04:17.630> physics<00:04:18.080> how

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
this tonight I to the dick physics how

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.830 
this tonight I to the dick physics how
are<00:04:18.980> displayed<00:04:19.370> like<00:04:19.400> Cosette<00:04:20.060> happen<00:04:20.570> like

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
are displayed like Cosette happen like

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.290 
are displayed like Cosette happen like
they<00:04:21.140> me<00:04:21.470> how<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.980> reacts<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.850> thing<00:04:23.060> leg

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
they me how it reacts like the thing leg

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.030 
they me how it reacts like the thing leg
was<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.720> hard<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.020> program<00:04:24.230> or<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.860> not

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
was that hard to program or is that not

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.620 
was that hard to program or is that not
too<00:04:25.220> bad<00:04:25.510> um<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:27.310> probably<00:04:28.310> know<00:04:28.880> more<00:04:28.910> physics

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
too bad um I probably know more physics

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.330 
too bad um I probably know more physics
and<00:04:29.840> your<00:04:29.960> advertising<00:04:30.590> will<00:04:30.710> drop<00:04:30.950> out<00:04:31.130> oh
