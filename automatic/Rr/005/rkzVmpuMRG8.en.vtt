inverted when the canister is inverted

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
inverted when the canister is inverted
it's<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> feed<00:00:15.509> liquid<00:00:15.960> instead<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.949> the

couple ounces and assembles very quickly
and<00:00:39.450> easily<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> stoves<00:00:43.200> connected

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and easily so now the stoves connected

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
and easily so now the stoves connected
to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> canister<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.700> burning<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to the canister and burning and it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
to the canister and burning and it's
warming<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> things<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> stove

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
warming up one of the things the stove

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.880 
warming up one of the things the stove
has<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:50.059> preheater<00:00:51.059> -

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
has see right here is a preheater -

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
has see right here is a preheater -
that's<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.280> important<00:00:53.730> feature

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that's going to be an important feature

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
that's going to be an important feature

in liquid feed mode unfortunately but

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
in liquid feed mode unfortunately but
this<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.970> made<00:01:12.510> by<00:01:12.540> cavia<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.229> designed<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> do

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this one made by cavia is designed to do

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.840 
this one made by cavia is designed to do
that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
that
we've<00:01:15.360> been<00:01:15.540> preheating<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.799> about

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
we've been preheating it here for about

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.609 
we've been preheating it here for about
30<00:01:17.970> seconds<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.080> recommend

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
30 seconds which is what they recommend

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.620 
30 seconds which is what they recommend
so<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.369> before<00:01:20.549> turning<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> canister<00:01:21.600> over

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so now before turning the canister over

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.830 
so now before turning the canister over
I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> bring<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> low

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm going to bring it down to a low

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
I'm going to bring it down to a low
level<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.159> avoid<00:01:26.400> any<00:01:26.580> flaring<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
level that's to avoid any flaring and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.850 
level that's to avoid any flaring and
then<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> rotate<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then I'm just going to rotate the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
then I'm just going to rotate the
canister<00:01:29.369> luckily<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.270> hose<00:01:30.950> does<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
canister luckily the hose does have a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
canister luckily the hose does have a
rotating<00:01:34.560> attachment<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:35.400> allows<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.940> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
rotating attachment which allows you to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.109 
rotating attachment which allows you to
do<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.500> turn<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.880> snow

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
do that so when we turn it over the snow

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.210 
do that so when we turn it over the snow
really<00:01:39.360> kicks<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.930> overdrive<00:01:40.100> because<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
really kicks into overdrive because of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
really kicks into overdrive because of
the<00:01:41.280> fact<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> you've<00:01:42.510> got<00:01:42.780> raw<00:01:43.440> liquid

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the fact that you've got raw liquid

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.550 
the fact that you've got raw liquid
feeding<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.729> hose<00:01:45.510> and<00:01:45.840> infamous<00:01:46.260> stove

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
feeding out the hose and infamous stove

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
feeding out the hose and infamous stove
but<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> preheating<00:01:48.330> tube<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.720> doing<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> nice

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
but the preheating tube is doing a nice

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.450 
but the preheating tube is doing a nice
job<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.920> keeping<00:01:50.159> things<00:01:50.580> under<00:01:50.880> control<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
job of keeping things under control and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
job of keeping things under control and
now<00:01:53.910> here's<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.300> kicker<00:01:54.510> I'm<00:01:54.810> looking<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
now here's the kicker I'm looking for a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340 
now here's the kicker I'm looking for a
stove<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.760> not<00:01:57.180> only<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.630> inverted<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
stove that can not only do inverted but

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
stove that can not only do inverted but
you<00:01:58.440> can<00:01:58.530> also<00:01:58.620> simmer<00:01:59.220> when<00:01:59.490> inverted<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you can also simmer when inverted so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.210 
you can also simmer when inverted so
let's<00:02:00.510> see<00:02:00.690> how<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.960> does<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.830> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.010> do<00:02:02.100> is

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
let's see how it does I'm going to do is

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030 
let's see how it does I'm going to do is
turn<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.550> valve<00:02:02.730> all<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> way<00:02:03.060> off<00:02:03.800> it's<00:02:04.800> off

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
turn the valve all the way off it's off

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.850 
turn the valve all the way off it's off
now<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.790> letting<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.680> extra<00:02:07.680> liquid

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
now and I'm letting the extra liquid

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.340 
now and I'm letting the extra liquid
burn<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:09.149> before<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.570> goes<00:02:09.780> away<00:02:09.990> I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
burn off and then before it goes away I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.040 
burn off and then before it goes away I
just<00:02:11.160> crack<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.700> back<00:02:12.000> open<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.420> little<00:02:12.660> bit<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
just crack it back open a little bit and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.400 
just crack it back open a little bit and
look<00:02:13.650> at<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.550> got<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:16.020> nice

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
look at that we got a really really nice

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.890 
look at that we got a really really nice
low<00:02:16.860> simmer<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.970> very<00:02:18.209> easy<00:02:18.570> way<00:02:18.870> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
low simmer and a very easy way to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.800 
low simmer and a very easy way to
accomplish<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
accomplish it so there you have it the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.000 
accomplish it so there you have it the
canister<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.350> upside<00:02:22.709> down<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:24.240> stove<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
canister is upside down the stove is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.400 
canister is upside down the stove is
burning<00:02:26.010> nice<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.090> low<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.959> saw<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> can

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
burning nice and low as you saw it can

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
burning nice and low as you saw it can
also<00:02:28.560> burn<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> high<00:02:29.489> high<00:02:30.030> power<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:30.570> you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
also burn that a high high power if you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.449 
also burn that a high high power if you
want<00:02:30.810> when<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> canisters<00:02:32.010> inverted

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
want when when the canisters inverted

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.550 
want when when the canisters inverted
and<00:02:32.670> what's<00:02:33.330> what's<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> goal<00:02:34.050> behind<00:02:34.380> all

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and what's what's the goal behind all

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.130 
and what's what's the goal behind all

canisters had liquid them had liquid in
them<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.790> really<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.030> took<00:02:45.239> forever<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.660> boil

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
