artistic<00:01:45.149> flair<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.960> sets<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> lock

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
artistic flair it really sets the lock

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
off there are hundreds of them I can't

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.600 
off there are hundreds of them I can't
imagine<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.799> time<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.280> -<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.460> they're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
imagine how much time is - if they're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
imagine how much time is - if they're
all<00:01:50.759> equal<00:01:51.030> depth<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.200> good<00:01:52.470> spacing

camera but after they made this lock and
they<00:02:59.030> assembled<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.599> front<00:02:59.870> plate<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.319> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
they assembled the front plate in the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.380 
they assembled the front plate in the
back<00:03:00.650> plate<00:03:00.980> they<00:03:01.310> put<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.610> back<00:03:01.849> into<00:03:02.180> the

back plate they put it back into the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.850 
back plate they put it back into the
lathe<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.959> they<00:03:03.049> turned<00:03:03.349> it<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.680> make

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
lathe and they turned it to make

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.819 
lathe and they turned it to make
everything<00:03:04.220> align<00:03:04.730> perfectly<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:06.079> nothing

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
everything align perfectly so it nothing

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
was there were no disfigurements it was

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500 
was there were no disfigurements it was
very<00:03:08.780> pleasing<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.130> eye<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.579> then<00:03:11.359> if

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
very pleasing to the eye and then if

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.690 
very pleasing to the eye and then if
that<00:03:11.660> wasn't<00:03:11.720> enough<00:03:12.170> they<00:03:13.130> went<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.639> they

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
that wasn't enough they went in and they

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.150 
that wasn't enough they went in and they
again<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.420> separate<00:03:14.930> machining<00:03:15.350> operation<00:03:15.950> and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
again a separate machining operation and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.789 
again a separate machining operation and
they<00:03:16.459> milled<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.359> bevel<00:03:17.930> in<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.290> edge<00:03:18.440> they

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
they milled this bevel in the edge they

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.039 
they milled this bevel in the edge they
could<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:19.340> made<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.810> level<00:03:20.810> just

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
could have just made it level just

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.660 
could have just made it level just
smooth<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:21.590> instead<00:03:21.889> they<00:03:22.069> put<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.310> very

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
smooth but instead they put a very

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.690 
smooth but instead they put a very
slight<00:03:23.319> rounded<00:03:24.319> groove<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.859> chamfered<00:03:25.370> groove

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
slight rounded groove a chamfered groove

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.150 
slight rounded groove a chamfered groove
and<00:03:26.660> they<00:03:26.810> don't<00:03:26.959> have<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.260> do<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:27.889> it

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
and they don't have to do this but it

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.250 
and they don't have to do this but it
adds<00:03:28.430> texture<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.209> pleasing<00:03:29.540> not<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.079> have<00:03:30.230> a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
adds texture it's pleasing not to have a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.840 
adds texture it's pleasing not to have a
sharp<00:03:30.590> edge<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.100> pleasant<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
sharp edge and it's pleasant to the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.449 
sharp edge and it's pleasant to the
touch<00:03:31.880> it's<00:03:32.359> not<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.750> cut<00:03:32.959> anything<00:03:33.459> on

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
touch it's not going to cut anything on

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.340 
touch it's not going to cut anything on
the<00:03:34.639> back<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.000> lock<00:03:35.180> there's<00:03:35.540> nothing<00:03:36.139> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the back of the lock there's nothing and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.650 
the back of the lock there's nothing and
I<00:03:36.410> think<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.400> reason<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.450> know<00:03:38.540> it's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
I think the reason is that you know it's

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.840 
I think the reason is that you know it's
to<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.959> door<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.440> no<00:03:40.280> one<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.430> ever<00:03:40.579> going<00:03:40.790> to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
to the door it no one is ever going to

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.670 
to the door it no one is ever going to
see<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.180> back<00:03:41.359> of<00:03:41.389> it<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.139> it's<00:03:42.410> just<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
see the back of it so it's just a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.490 
see the back of it so it's just a
completely<00:03:43.100> smooth<00:03:43.549> finish<00:03:44.090> now<00:03:45.019> you've<00:03:45.290> seen

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
completely smooth finish now you've seen

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.229 
completely smooth finish now you've seen
the<00:03:45.590> front<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.160> you've<00:03:46.489> seen<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.790> back<00:03:47.000> and

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
the front and you've seen the back and

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.750 
the front and you've seen the back and
you<00:03:47.299> notice<00:03:47.540> there's<00:03:47.720> no<00:03:47.900> keyhole<00:03:48.760> well

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
you notice there's no keyhole well

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.789 
you notice there's no keyhole well
that's<00:03:50.480> because<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.959> keyhole<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.530> on<00:03:51.709> the

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
that's because the keyhole is on the

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.670 
that's because the keyhole is on the
bottom<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:53.209> one<00:03:53.450> more<00:03:53.480> unusual<00:03:54.170> thing

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
line up with the six levers that are on

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.170 
line up with the six levers that are on
the<00:04:23.780> inside<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.170> this<00:04:24.500> lock<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.670> when<00:04:25.820> we<00:04:25.940> place

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
the inside of this lock so when we place

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.390 
the inside of this lock so when we place
the<00:04:26.360> key<00:04:26.600> in<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> key<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.530> has<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.860> go<00:04:28.220> in

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
the key in the key and it has to go in

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.320 
the key in the key and it has to go in
only<00:04:28.670> one<00:04:28.970> way

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
only one way

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.350 
only one way
and<00:04:29.440> then<00:04:30.440> we<00:04:31.010> don't<00:04:31.160> turn<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.640> obviously<00:04:32.180> we

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
and then we don't turn it obviously we

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.960 
and then we don't turn it obviously we
can't<00:04:32.660> because<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.440> Cena<00:04:33.860> groove<00:04:34.160> we<00:04:34.700> push

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
can't because of the Cena groove we push

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.550 
can't because of the Cena groove we push
it<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.270> again<00:04:35.420> it's<00:04:35.690> called<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.960> push<00:04:36.230> lever

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
it so again it's called a push lever

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.980 
it so again it's called a push lever
lock<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:37.160> when<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.460> push<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.790> in<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
lock and when we push it in we get a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.600 
lock and when we push it in we get a
very<00:04:39.200> vigorous<00:04:39.530> opening<00:04:40.490> I'll<00:04:40.850> do<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.090> again

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
very vigorous opening I'll do that again

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.880 
very vigorous opening I'll do that again
push<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.790> lock<00:04:43.970> now<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:44.870> push<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> certain

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
push the lock now I push it to a certain

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.460 
push the lock now I push it to a certain

depth and the grooves internally will
all<00:04:48.650> align<00:04:49.090> only<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.300> reach<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.840> point

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
all align only when I reach that point

to reach the unlock gate after it's
aligned<00:05:00.130> now<00:05:01.130> why<00:05:01.669> my<00:05:02.060> dilemma

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
aligned now why my dilemma

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.770 
aligned now why my dilemma
why<00:05:02.750> am<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.960> disappointed<00:05:03.140> in<00:05:03.680> my<00:05:03.800> decision<00:05:04.280> to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
why am I disappointed in my decision to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.380 
why am I disappointed in my decision to
buy<00:05:05.780> three<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.169> these<00:05:06.790> well<00:05:07.790> this<00:05:08.030> is<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.240> only

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
buy three of these well this is the only

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.030 
buy three of these well this is the only
one<00:05:08.540> with<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> key<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.169> other<00:05:09.200> two<00:05:09.470> have<00:05:09.650> no<00:05:09.830> key

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
one with a key the other two have no key

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.159 
one with a key the other two have no key
so<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.490> think<00:05:10.790> well<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.750> look<00:05:11.900> at<00:05:11.990> all<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
cracks on that I mean let's try to shim

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.780 
cracks on that I mean let's try to shim
it<00:05:15.470> but<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.950> know<00:05:16.040> I've<00:05:16.130> tried<00:05:16.370> all<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.669> that

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
it but you know I've tried all of that

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.460 
it but you know I've tried all of that
I've<00:05:17.030> tried<00:05:17.210> every<00:05:17.479> groove<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.870> can<00:05:18.020> fit<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.229> pick

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
I've tried every groove I can fit a pick

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.650 
I've tried every groove I can fit a pick
into<00:05:18.680> or<00:05:19.010> feeler<00:05:19.250> gauge<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.850> then<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.360> went<00:05:20.600> to

it I'm all ears
well<00:06:09.800> I<00:06:09.830> figured<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.190> would<00:06:10.220> impression<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.880> and

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
well I figured I would impression it and

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.850 
well I figured I would impression it and
again<00:06:11.390> I<00:06:11.419> tried<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.840> impression<00:06:12.470> it<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:12.770> it

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
again I tried to impression it and it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.460 
again I tried to impression it and it
works<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.520> same<00:06:13.640> way<00:06:14.030> they<00:06:14.270> don't<00:06:14.540> impression

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
works the same way they don't impression

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.680 
works the same way they don't impression
the<00:06:15.590> keys<00:06:15.860> as<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.310> typical<00:06:16.850> Tim<00:06:17.180> pin<00:06:17.450> tumbler

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
the keys as a typical Tim pin tumbler

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.990 
the keys as a typical Tim pin tumbler
would<00:06:18.020> so<00:06:18.260> again<00:06:18.560> I'm<00:06:18.650> out<00:06:18.740> of<00:06:18.800> luck<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.250> have<00:06:19.370> no

would so again I'm out of luck I have no

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.760 
would so again I'm out of luck I have no
