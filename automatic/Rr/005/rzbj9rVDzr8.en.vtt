00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
with loot in the storages so I can

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.800 
with loot in the storages so I can
attack<00:01:14.310> both<00:01:14.610> types<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.090> bases<00:01:15.450> fairly

comfortably and the army is cheap so I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880

against bases that have their storages

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.600 
against bases that have their storages
deep<00:02:52.620> inside<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> base

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
deep inside the base

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.010 
deep inside the base
but<00:02:53.790> remember<00:02:54.120> dragons<00:02:54.510> are<00:02:54.600> extremely

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
but remember dragons are extremely

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.840 
but remember dragons are extremely
expensive<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.830> take<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.520> really

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
expensive and they take a really really

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.970 
expensive and they take a really really
long<00:02:57.030> time<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.450> train<00:02:57.720> making<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.620> not<00:02:58.770> worth

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
long time to train making it not worth

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.800 
long time to train making it not worth
it<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.340> someone<00:02:59.520> say<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.970> townhall<00:03:00.360> 7<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
it for someone say in townhall 7 to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.600 
it for someone say in townhall 7 to
train<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.350> farm<00:03:01.860> with<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:02.160> dragons

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
train and farm with all dragons

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.190 
train and farm with all dragons
basically<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.720> would<00:03:03.870> lose<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.050> lot

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
basically because you would lose a lot

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200 
basically because you would lose a lot
of<00:03:04.410> elixir<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.040> not<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.580> able<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.910> rate<00:03:06.060> as

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
of elixir and not be able to rate as

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.420 
of elixir and not be able to rate as
much<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:07.020> terms<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.890> ranges<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.340> have

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
much in terms of the ranges I have

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.250 
much in terms of the ranges I have
provided<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.510> reason<00:03:09.870> why<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.020> say

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
provided to you the reason why I say

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.050 
provided to you the reason why I say
these<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.500> flexible<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.940> can

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
these are flexible is because you can

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.120 
these are flexible is because you can
train<00:03:12.270> it's<00:03:12.420> cheap<00:03:12.660> army<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.230> still<00:03:13.770> stay<00:03:14.100> at

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
train it's cheap army and still stay at

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you farm you should not care about

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.150

reason why I say it's okay to lose
trophies<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.240> if<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.570> find<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.900> base<00:03:31.080> with<00:03:31.260> all

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
trophies is if you find a base with all

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.350 
trophies is if you find a base with all
of<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.800> collectors<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> outside<00:03:32.760> you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
of the collectors on the outside you

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.180 
of the collectors on the outside you
don't<00:03:33.540> necessarily<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.380> deploy<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:35.070> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190

don't necessarily have to deploy all of
your<00:03:35.310> troops<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.880> fact<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.810> makes<00:03:37.110> more<00:03:37.290> sense

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
your troops in fact it makes more sense

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.680 
your troops in fact it makes more sense
to<00:03:37.680> save<00:03:38.040> them<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.490> next<00:03:38.550> battle<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.240> not

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
to save them for the next battle and not

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.480 
to save them for the next battle and not
have<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.990> train<00:03:40.260> as<00:03:40.410> many<00:03:40.620> troops<00:03:40.830> as<00:03:41.070> before

have to train as many troops as before
so<00:03:41.790> try<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.000> raid<00:03:42.300> responsibly<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.590> keep

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
won't be that way forever mainly because

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.670 
won't be that way forever mainly because
it<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.190> relates<00:04:29.400> back<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.700> supply<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.330> demand

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680
