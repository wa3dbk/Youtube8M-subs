00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
before we don't want to review let's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
before we don't want to review let's
take<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:33.270> quick<00:00:33.390> look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
take a really quick look at the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
take a really quick look at the
packaging<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.980> i<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.790> enjoy<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
packaging because i really enjoy the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.049 
packaging because i really enjoy the
packaging<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.020> figures<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.940> can

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
packaging in these figures as you can

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.369 
packaging in these figures as you can
see<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.450> they're<00:00:39.719> modeled<00:00:40.110> after<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
see there they're modeled after the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
see there they're modeled after the
original<00:00:40.710> counter<00:00:41.960> packages<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.410> i<00:00:44.870> think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
original counter packages so i think

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.790 
original counter packages so i think
it's<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it's me they don't know what the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
it's me they don't know what the
prequels<00:00:47.250> tools<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.090> canada<00:00:48.899> had<00:00:49.020> made<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
prequels tools as if canada had made the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.750 
prequels tools as if canada had made the
prequel<00:00:49.739> figures<00:00:50.780> such<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.809> Star<00:00:52.170> Wars

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760

articulation<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.590> had<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.670> most

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
articulation you had the most

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.610 
articulation you had the most
articulated<00:03:37.810> General<00:03:38.080> Grievous<00:03:38.200> I've<00:03:38.470> ever

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
articulated General Grievous I've ever

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.260 
articulated General Grievous I've ever
had<00:03:38.830> as<00:03:39.010> well<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.500> head<00:03:41.830> can<00:03:42.459> rotate<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.239> the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
had as well the head can rotate all the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.300 
had as well the head can rotate all the
way<00:03:43.450> around<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.770> little<00:03:44.980> hint<00:03:45.190> it

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
way around but it's a little hint it

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.400 
way around but it's a little hint it
when<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.520> have<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.730> cape<00:03:45.940> on<00:03:46.140> then<00:03:47.140> well<00:03:47.380> go

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
when you have the cape on then well go

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.850 
when you have the cape on then well go
up<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:47.980> down<00:03:48.340> slightly<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> arms<00:03:50.739> are

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
up and down slightly when the arms are

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.100 
up and down slightly when the arms are
connected<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:52.209> go<00:03:52.330> in<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.780> out<00:03:52.870> and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
connected it can go in and out and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.720 
connected it can go in and out and
rotate<00:03:53.440> around<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.130> that's<00:03:54.280> just<00:03:54.430> about<00:03:54.670> it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
rotate around but that's just about it

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.880 
rotate around but that's just about it
because<00:03:55.150> if<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.450> move<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.320> around<00:03:56.380> any<00:03:56.739> other

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
because if you move it around any other

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.890 
because if you move it around any other
way<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.670> will<00:03:57.760> disconnect<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.390> arms<00:03:58.660> most

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
way it will disconnect the arms most

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.190 
way it will disconnect the arms most
likely<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.800> when<00:03:59.980> they<00:04:00.100> aren't<00:04:00.370> connected

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
likely but when they aren't connected

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.160 
likely but when they aren't connected
the<00:04:02.200> arms<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.739> go<00:04:02.920> on<00:04:03.640> each<00:04:04.209> arm<00:04:04.510> each<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:05.080> the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
the arms can go on each arm each of the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.540 
the arms can go on each arm each of the
four<00:04:05.410> arms<00:04:05.620> can<00:04:05.830> go<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.340> out<00:04:07.110> rotate<00:04:08.110> at

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
four arms can go in and out rotate at

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.430 
four arms can go in and out rotate at
like<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.790> bicep<00:04:10.720> tribes<00:04:10.959> where<00:04:11.200> there's<00:04:11.410> a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
like the bicep tribes where there's a

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.590 
like the bicep tribes where there's a
little<00:04:11.620> pin<00:04:11.769> right<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.120> better<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.330> elbow

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
little pin right here better the elbow

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.960 
little pin right here better the elbow
and<00:04:13.780> rotate<00:04:14.470> up<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.680> arm<00:04:14.980> which<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> really

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
and rotate up the arm which is a really

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.320 
and rotate up the arm which is a really
nice<00:04:16.090> articulation<00:04:17.160> especially<00:04:18.160> for<00:04:18.400> you

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
nice articulation especially for you

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.240 
nice articulation especially for you
know<00:04:19.450> doing<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.049> four<00:04:20.350> arms<00:04:21.210> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
know doing that to all four arms the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.510 
know doing that to all four arms the
like

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
like

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.570 
like
I<00:04:24.610> guess<00:04:25.479> waste<00:04:25.810> your<00:04:26.050> abs<00:04:26.259> right<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:26.620> tour

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I guess waste your abs right here tour

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.820 
I guess waste your abs right here tour
so<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:27.759> guess<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.539> on<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> ball-joint<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.590> can<00:04:29.710> go

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
so I guess is on a ball-joint you can go

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.330 
so I guess is on a ball-joint you can go
forward<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.460> back<00:04:31.770> side<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.889> side<00:04:33.039> rotate

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
forward and back side to side rotate

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.279 
forward and back side to side rotate
around<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.300> know<00:04:34.389> do<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.690> hold<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:34.960> friend

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
around you know do that hold I friend

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.710 
around you know do that hold I friend
joint<00:04:35.530> kind<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.860> thing<00:04:36.039> and<00:04:36.310> then<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.120> leg<00:04:37.389> oh

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
joint kind of thing and then the leg oh

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.070 
joint kind of thing and then the leg oh
