00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.439
 addictive game is is one of the best games 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 that I already played I joked that he is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.650
 paid out 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 I'm going to put the price and not the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 Link's description of the Olympus 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 put in the description of the video more people 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 and worth absolutely every penny that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 you pay for it, it's okay with 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.180
 I put on top the team that is the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.360
 first I want 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.820
 It's been a while now, I 'm planning this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 video of and today I'll talk only about 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 they you came promote many games 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 Unfortunately today is not your day. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.109
 I will talk about rip tide gp2 people who 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 fascinating game it's the same as vector 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.610
 limit is also responsible for the game 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.119
 beach bang babies deception 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 I made a video about whether this 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 another game too but same as here 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 no staff because of the design 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.369
 because of the gameplay because of the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.119
 proposal which is a race in water to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.700
 there is always a chaotic race and 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 multi-phase proposal you have to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 compete with other people compete 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.259
 yourself and this demands a lot from you. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 you can upgrade in one in your 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.890
 of your vehicle 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.850
 but I have played and played a lot 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.360
 're satisfied even then will I go 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 to show you here has a way 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 career mode online litigation you play 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.399
 a lake and a Czech way where I played 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.200
 This year I sometimes did not like it 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.479
 online play I did not realize how I do not know 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 it is because it has few players but 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.579
 as I'm here by career mode 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.180
 So let's go to him, then, I see. 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:18.390
 You have many stages here and you. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.549
 have to collect stars for you and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.099
 unlocking the next phases 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.780
 I'm going here in the first phase that is 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.780
 It's easier for me to be ashamed. 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.260
 then you will compete with others 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:41.400
 players kiss the visual people who 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.530
 awesome thing or you 're good at 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.079
 big question here will you compete 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.290
 Do you have a cube mode such as that 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.299
 I think you push it, it's going to run to 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.569
 Geez, and you do these maneuvers. 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.480
 radicals there is every maneuver of this 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.790
 allows you to win bigger but this one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.609
 This tube comes back to you is and more 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.069
 fast and how do you do to make 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.629
 these good maneuvers you have to learn 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.419
 each one of them 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.180
 and for you to learn many 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.109
 mainly those that give you more 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.079
 power 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:22.470
 you need to unlock phases you 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.810
 you need to gain experience and this 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.629
 Experience gives you this there is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.590
 possibility of unlocking new 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.989
 maneuvers 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.379
 the intention several maneuvers the maneuvers 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:39.409
 Are they on the same screen? 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:44.609
 outside to the inside up and down and 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:49.579
 really allows you to do 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:52.859
 a lot of stuff then this game is kia 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.169
 see another maneuver I learned that 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.019
 It gives me more turbo and I go more I know 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:02.780
 that appears a gameplay but came 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:08.790
 sensational people who theme it then 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.500
 I will come back here and okay the other another topic 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.420
 what 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.440
 far ahead for you to see that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:21.260
 crazy thing is you also have to phase 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.380
 of elimination that every 15 seconds the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.110
 last placed loses is eliminated 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.220
 so you can never be to be the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.000
 last until you're the first nÃ© 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.920
 so it's more a one phase has the phases 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.440
 only from the radical maneuvers you make 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.570
 maneuvers and each maneuver point , and worth 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.680
 You have to be the first and it worked. 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:50.810
 So I highly recommend this one. 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.840
 game and he is not is not not free 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.169
 but as I said at the beginning it's okay 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.410
 absolutely every penny people I do not 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.470
 I'm a very excited guy with the game. 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.040
 on the hand but this one changed my 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.160
 opinion about game regarding 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.770
 to waste my time and not worth it 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 lose time in a game of this here is worth 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.729
 it's a shame 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.770
 So, folks, this is mine. 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.910
 Today's recommendation I hope you all 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.950
 have enjoyed 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.680
 I especially hope you like it. 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.790
 this game because I liked too 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.820
 and is very different from most other 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.550
 games that I already passed in my hand 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.950
 and I could not stop recommending it 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.740
 It took me a long time to 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.620
 to make this video precisely because 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.500
 I was getting used to playing coaching. 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.930
 thinking that I was going to tell you and me 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.750
 I hope it was very clear. 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.700
 here in my proposal so good that 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.810
 you forgot to talk you can 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.020
 see and buy a new vehicle in're 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.669
 are expensive vehicles increasingly expensive 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.610
 more expensive and requires that you play a lot 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.890
 You spend money, do not you? 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.390
 can paint you can change what you already 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:14.150
 bought these here and there when 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.360
 you buy one has an upgrade right? 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.550
 acceleration at maximum speed in the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.410
 handling and the bust 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.860
 she, that little power is to give you 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.890
 speed and every upgrade will 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.050
 increasing the value you need to have more 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.840
 money but people are worth it 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.790
 I hope you liked doing the 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.110
 download spending this money was a 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.090
 well-invested money 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.090
 A big hug and until the next time.
