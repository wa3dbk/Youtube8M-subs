00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.729 
know this some of you know this game is
is<00:04:08.489> good<00:04:09.120> i<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.450> fifa<00:04:09.720> 11<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.350> there's<00:04:10.530> some

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
is good i like fifa 11 but there's some

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.530 
is good i like fifa 11 but there's some
stuff<00:04:11.010> that's<00:04:11.190> that's<00:04:11.730> pretty<00:04:11.850> unrealistic

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
stuff that's that's pretty unrealistic

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.560 
stuff that's that's pretty unrealistic
like<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.410> right<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:14.090> Sordell<00:04:15.090> winning<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
like this right here Sordell winning a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.770 
like this right here Sordell winning a
header<00:04:15.780> off<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:17.280> Toure<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.940> don't<00:04:18.359> think<00:04:18.480> that

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
header off of Toure I don't think that

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.349 
header off of Toure I don't think that
would<00:04:18.870> really<00:04:19.109> happen<00:04:19.910> but<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.209> what

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
would really happen but you know what

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.150 
would really happen but you know what
I'll<00:04:21.479> take<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.140> that<00:04:22.350> puts<00:04:22.590> me<00:04:22.710> up<00:04:22.800> one<00:04:22.979> nil

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
I'll take it and that puts me up one nil

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.350 
I'll take it and that puts me up one nil
and<00:04:23.280> we're<00:04:23.400> kind<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.610> skipping<00:04:23.880> ahead<00:04:24.090> to

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and we're kind of skipping ahead to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.140 
and we're kind of skipping ahead to
