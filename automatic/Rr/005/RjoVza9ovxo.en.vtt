00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
dialogue and actually they layered it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
dialogue and actually they layered it
over<00:01:09.540> top<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> original<00:01:10.380> dialogue<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
over top of the original dialogue to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640 
over top of the original dialogue to
give<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> reverb<00:01:12.299> eques<00:01:13.020> effect

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

give it a kind of a reverb eques effect
yeah<00:01:14.159> um<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> explains<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
yeah um so that explains that so it's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.950 
yeah um so that explains that so it's
probably<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.060> dialogue<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
probably not actually dialogue that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
probably not actually dialogue that
happens<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.979> movie<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.820> probably

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
happens in the movie it was probably

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
happens in the movie it was probably
just<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.750> scripted<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> trailer

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
just they scripted it for the trailer

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
just they scripted it for the trailer
they<00:01:23.369> said<00:01:23.610> recorded<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> week<00:01:24.330> before<00:01:24.540> or

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
they said recorded like a week before or

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
they said recorded like a week before or
something<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> seems<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
something so it seems like it's not it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.240 
something so it seems like it's not it
might<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.600> canon<00:01:27.990> this

someone's looking at it yeah so from

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.260 
someone's looking at it yeah so from
that<00:01:52.920> cause<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> dirt<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> had<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that cause of dirt we kind of had this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
that cause of dirt we kind of had this
idea<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> mask<00:01:55.229> looks<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.680> evil

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
idea because the mask looks kind of evil

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
idea because the mask looks kind of evil
and<00:01:56.130> everything<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.549> had<00:01:56.700> had<00:01:56.880> sort<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> this

idea that it was Luke and he'd go on to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
idea that it was Luke and he'd go on to
the<00:01:59.460> dark<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.119> something<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.689> he<00:02:00.780> was

bit unlikely but I mean dark Empire
happened<00:02:24.239> yeah<00:02:24.569> um<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.010> from<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:27.030> were

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
happened yeah um so from that we were

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.819 
happened yeah um so from that we were
kind<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> speculating<00:02:27.989> at<00:02:28.079> least<00:02:28.200> recently<00:02:28.620> if

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
kind of speculating at least recently if

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.069 
kind of speculating at least recently if
this<00:02:29.010> voice<00:02:29.190> overs<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.549> can<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.269> from<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
this voice overs I can and from the

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.250 
this voice overs I can and from the
trailer<00:02:31.349> we<00:02:31.560> saw<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.129> other<00:02:32.400> hooded<00:02:32.940> figure

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
trailer we saw this other hooded figure

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.660 
trailer we saw this other hooded figure
putting<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.349> like<00:02:34.500> metal<00:02:34.769> hand<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.099> r2d2

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
putting is like metal hand out r2d2

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
putting is like metal hand out r2d2
obviously<00:02:36.269> it's<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> same<00:02:36.690> hand<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:36.959> Luke

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
obviously it's the same hand that Luke

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.289 
obviously it's the same hand that Luke
lost<00:02:37.409> but<00:02:37.769> they<00:02:38.159> didn't<00:02:38.340> show<00:02:38.489> us<00:02:38.610> his<00:02:38.730> face<00:02:39.000> at

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
lost but they didn't show us his face at

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.569 
lost but they didn't show us his face at
all<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.650> he<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:40.980> hooded<00:02:41.220> very

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
all I and like he was hooded very

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.069 
all I and like he was hooded very
similar<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.150> concept<00:02:42.540> art<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.900> saw

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
similar to this concept art that we saw

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.410 
similar to this concept art that we saw
with<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.410> mass<00:02:43.590> character<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.640> there's<00:02:45.359> still

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
with the mass character so there's still

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
with the mass character so there's still
speculation<00:02:45.930> whether<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.410> was<00:02:46.560> Luke<00:02:46.859> again

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
speculation whether that was Luke again

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.229 
speculation whether that was Luke again
now<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:48.269> was<00:02:48.780> him<00:02:48.959> touching<00:02:49.730> r2d2<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
now that was him touching r2d2 but this

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.059 
now that was him touching r2d2 but this
masked<00:02:51.629> concept<00:02:52.079> art<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.349> still<00:02:52.560> okay<00:02:53.040> his

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
masked concept art is still okay his

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.860

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
it was a fleshy hand yeah so maybe an

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.420 
it was a fleshy hand yeah so maybe an
isolation<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.819> deteriorated<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.250> it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
isolation it deteriorated but that it

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.819 
isolation it deteriorated but that it
looks<00:03:05.819> very<00:03:06.120> similar<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:07.200> masked

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
looks very similar to the masked

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.309 
looks very similar to the masked
character<00:03:08.280> who<00:03:08.609> also<00:03:08.909> has<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.540> robotic<00:03:10.049> right

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.069 
character who also has a robotic right
hand<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.739> same<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.099> Luke's<00:03:11.310> yeah<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.659> a

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
hand the same as Luke's yeah so a

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.900 
hand the same as Luke's yeah so a
speculation<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.069> we<00:03:14.130> have<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.760> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
speculation that we have now is that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.640 
speculation that we have now is that
maybe<00:03:15.239> he<00:03:15.569> has<00:03:15.780> gone<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.200> dark<00:03:16.440> side<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
maybe he has gone to the dark side and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.440 
maybe he has gone to the dark side and
that's<00:03:16.889> not<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.730> hasn't<00:03:18.000> been<00:03:18.060> rewritten<00:03:18.299> by

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that's not it hasn't been rewritten by

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.759 
that's not it hasn't been rewritten by
this<00:03:18.690> trailer<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.139> anything<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:19.590> kind<00:03:19.739> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
this trailer if anything that's kind of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.199 
this trailer if anything that's kind of
giving<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.130> little<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.430> more<00:03:20.609> into<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
giving a little bit more into that I

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.970 
giving a little bit more into that I
mean<00:03:21.359> we<00:03:21.870> see<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.109> thing<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.380> was<00:03:22.500> talking<00:03:22.859> to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
mean we see this thing we was talking to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.460 
mean we see this thing we was talking to
to<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.430> other<00:03:23.549> character<00:03:24.169> presumably<00:03:25.169> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
to this other character presumably a

cure solo or someone's way technically
yeah<00:03:28.650> rays<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.340> now<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.329> my<00:03:30.480> canon

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
yeah rays of now but if that's my canon

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.089 
yeah rays of now but if that's my canon
maybe<00:03:31.079> he<00:03:31.169> doesn't<00:03:31.319> talk<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.590> her<00:03:31.769> maybe<00:03:31.919> he's

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
maybe he doesn't talk to her maybe he's

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.319 
maybe he doesn't talk to her maybe he's
not<00:03:32.250> trying<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.519> give<00:03:32.639> her<00:03:32.730> advice<00:03:32.819> at<00:03:33.180> least

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
not trying to give her advice at least

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.640 
not trying to give her advice at least
at<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.569> part<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> movie<00:03:34.049> any<00:03:34.260> starts<00:03:34.530> off

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
at this part in the movie any starts off

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.080 
at this part in the movie any starts off
they'll<00:03:34.980> kind<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> dark<00:03:35.760> side<00:03:35.940> or

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
they'll kind of go to the dark side or

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.490 
they'll kind of go to the dark side or
something<00:03:36.389> like<00:03:36.480> maybe<00:03:36.690> he<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.019> still<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.290> bit

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
something like maybe he is still a bit

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650 
something like maybe he is still a bit
evil<00:03:38.370> at<00:03:38.489> some<00:03:38.669> point<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.150> movie<00:03:39.480> or

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
evil at some point in this movie or

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.129 
evil at some point in this movie or
maybe<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:40.079> how<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.379> ends<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.760> thing<00:03:41.970> is

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
maybe that's how it ends the thing is

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.259 
maybe that's how it ends the thing is
it's<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:44.099> way<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> voiceovers<00:03:44.910> implies

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
it's a the way the voiceovers implies

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.119 
it's a the way the voiceovers implies
says<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:46.199> they<00:03:46.500> show<00:03:46.709> that

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
says like I have it they show that

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.250 
says like I have it they show that
figure<00:03:47.699> so<00:03:47.879> it<00:03:48.000> seems<00:03:48.239> an<00:03:48.449> implying<00:03:48.930> that's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
figure so it seems an implying that's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.000 
figure so it seems an implying that's
Luke<00:03:49.500> yeah<00:03:49.889> um<00:03:50.160> but<00:03:50.459> then<00:03:50.639> if<00:03:51.650> he<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.799> this

gives us my vision wearing this mask and
it's<00:04:13.769> yeah<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.340> would<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.609> kind<00:04:14.849> of<00:04:14.910> weird<00:04:15.060> that

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
it's yeah it would be kind of weird that

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.729 
it's yeah it would be kind of weird that
he's<00:04:15.359> wearing<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.810> light<00:04:16.049> metallic<00:04:16.380> masks

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
he's wearing this light metallic masks

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.890 
he's wearing this light metallic masks
were<00:04:16.949> never<00:04:17.190> even<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.609> he<00:04:18.000> was<00:04:18.209> good<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.690> mean

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
were never even if he was good I mean

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.420 
were never even if he was good I mean
there's<00:04:19.409> a<00:04:19.500> chance<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.829> it's<00:04:20.039> kind<00:04:20.159> of<00:04:20.310> a

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
there's a chance that it's kind of a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.979 
there's a chance that it's kind of a
part<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.940> skies<00:04:21.180> or<00:04:21.450> something<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.870> mean

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
part of the skies or something I mean

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.630 
part of the skies or something I mean
it's<00:04:22.079> must<00:04:22.200> be<00:04:22.289> an<00:04:22.380> isolation<00:04:22.860> but<00:04:23.130> if<00:04:23.370> you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
it's must be an isolation but if you

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.070 
it's must be an isolation but if you
left<00:04:23.820> isolation<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.450> some<00:04:24.570> reason<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.930> could

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
left isolation for some reason you could

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.990 
left isolation for some reason you could
be<00:04:25.200> wearing<00:04:25.349> it<00:04:25.590> as<00:04:25.740> part<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.099> disguise<00:04:26.460> but

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
be wearing it as part of a disguise but

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.279 
be wearing it as part of a disguise but
it<00:04:27.060> still<00:04:27.240> seems<00:04:27.419> kind<00:04:27.630> of<00:04:27.659> like<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.990> weird

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
it still seems kind of like a weird

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.320 
it still seems kind of like a weird
thing<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.590> do<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.159> you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> good<00:04:29.849> person<00:04:30.240> I

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
thing to do if you know a good person I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.790 
thing to do if you know a good person I
don't<00:04:30.390> know<00:04:30.570> well<00:04:30.780> also<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.260> whole<00:04:31.409> thing<00:04:31.650> is

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
don't know well also the whole thing is

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.649 
don't know well also the whole thing is
that<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.070> he<00:04:32.310> seems<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.669> be<00:04:32.789> like<00:04:32.969> consoling

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
that is he seems to be like consoling

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.839 
that is he seems to be like consoling
r2d2<00:04:34.200> or<00:04:34.530> something<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.130> that's<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.400> very<00:04:35.430> lip

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
r2d2 or something and that's a very lip

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.180 
r2d2 or something and that's a very lip
thing<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.570> i<00:04:36.599> think<00:04:36.719> that<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.260> Luke<00:04:37.710> the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
thing to do so i think that is Luke the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.790 
thing to do so i think that is Luke the
question<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.940> he<00:04:39.630> also<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.080> guy<00:04:40.409> with<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
question is is he also the guy with the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.620 
question is is he also the guy with the
mask<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.340> now<00:04:41.520> there's<00:04:41.909> there's<00:04:42.210> kind<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.510> a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
mask and now there's there's kind of a

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.719 
mask and now there's there's kind of a
little<00:04:42.810> bit<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.169> new<00:04:43.380> fuel<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.400> debate

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
little bit of new fuel to that debate

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.320 
little bit of new fuel to that debate
yeah<00:04:45.330> um<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:46.550> there<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.700> go<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:48.000> don't<00:04:48.150> really

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
yeah um so there you go I don't really

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.969 
yeah um so there you go I don't really
know<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.750> believe<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.139> yeah<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.380> guess<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
know what to believe so yeah I guess the

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.339 
know what to believe so yeah I guess the
possibilities<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.700> end<00:04:50.849> up<00:04:51.000> with<00:04:51.180> uh<00:04:51.719> that's

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
possibilities you end up with uh that's

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.440 
possibilities you end up with uh that's
the<00:04:52.650> guy<00:04:52.770> with<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:52.979> mask<00:04:53.219> and<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.880> he's<00:04:54.300> not

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
the guy with the mask and it he's not

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.360 
the guy with the mask and it he's not
Luke<00:04:54.719> Skywalker<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.800> seen<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.099> trailer

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
Luke Skywalker that you seen the trailer

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.339 
Luke Skywalker that you seen the trailer
but<00:04:56.550> then<00:04:56.639> why<00:04:56.789> is<00:04:56.849> he<00:04:57.000> with<00:04:57.210> r2d2<00:04:57.570> in<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.169> bed

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
but then why is he with r2d2 in the bed

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.649 
but then why is he with r2d2 in the bed
so<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.560> doesn't<00:04:59.039> seem<00:04:59.219> right<00:04:59.270> the<00:05:00.270> second

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
so that doesn't seem right the second

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.830 
so that doesn't seem right the second
thing<00:05:01.229> is<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.669> that<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.700> Luke<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.330> he's<00:05:03.630> not

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
thing is that that is Luke and he's not

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.360 
thing is that that is Luke and he's not
wearing<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.229> mask<00:05:04.469> and<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> guy<00:05:04.950> in<00:05:05.099> the<00:05:05.190> mask

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
wearing the mask and the guy in the mask

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.890 
wearing the mask and the guy in the mask
is<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.760> separate<00:05:06.120> character<00:05:06.510> that<00:05:06.659> we<00:05:06.750> see<00:05:06.870> in

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
is a separate character that we see in

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.719 
is a separate character that we see in
the<00:05:07.050> concept<00:05:07.440> art<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.070> then<00:05:08.250> there's<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.520> third

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
the concept art and then there's a third

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.969 
the concept art and then there's a third
possibility<00:05:08.760> with<00:05:09.570> yes<00:05:10.200> that<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.409> Luke<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.919> the

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
possibility with yes that is Luke in the

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.070 
possibility with yes that is Luke in the
concept<00:05:11.400> art<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:11.880> yes<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.630> Luke<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:12.990> the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
concept art and yes that is Luke in the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.600 
concept art and yes that is Luke in the
trailer<00:05:13.469> but<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.860> reason<00:05:14.010> you<00:05:14.190> don't<00:05:14.279> see<00:05:14.400> his

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
trailer but the reason you don't see his

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.690 
trailer but the reason you don't see his
face<00:05:14.880> is<00:05:15.210> because<00:05:15.930> he<00:05:16.500> has<00:05:16.889> this<00:05:17.039> mask<00:05:17.310> yeah

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
face is because he has this mask yeah

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.219 
face is because he has this mask yeah
and<00:05:17.909> even<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> concept<00:05:18.659> art<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:18.960> can<00:05:19.080> see

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
and even in the concept art you can see

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.649 
and even in the concept art you can see
that<00:05:19.409> it's<00:05:19.770> not<00:05:19.919> like<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.070> robotic<00:05:21.000> face<00:05:21.240> it's<00:05:21.510> a

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
that it's not like a robotic face it's a

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.510 
that it's not like a robotic face it's a
human<00:05:22.260> wearing<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.650> mask<00:05:22.860> you<00:05:23.070> can<00:05:23.190> see<00:05:23.340> like

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
human wearing a mask you can see like

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.430 
human wearing a mask you can see like
lips<00:05:23.789> and<00:05:24.029> stuff<00:05:24.240> underneath<00:05:24.510> yeah<00:05:24.960> right<00:05:25.229> and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
lips and stuff underneath yeah right and

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.750 
lips and stuff underneath yeah right and
it<00:05:25.560> seems<00:05:25.800> like<00:05:25.950> if<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.159> concept<00:05:26.460> art<00:05:26.610> was

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it seems like if the concept art was

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.540 
it seems like if the concept art was
sort<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.029> a<00:05:27.180> really<00:05:27.630> try<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:27.960> really<00:05:28.710> like<00:05:28.979> art

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
sort of a really try and really like art

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.730 
sort of a really try and really like art
artistic<00:05:30.389> thing<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:30.659> kylo<00:05:31.050> Ren's<00:05:31.289> maski

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
artistic thing of kylo Ren's maski

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.320 
artistic thing of kylo Ren's maski
doesn't<00:05:32.279> look<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.550> same<00:05:32.580> at<00:05:32.880> all<00:05:32.969> like<00:05:33.210> a

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
doesn't look the same at all like a

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.209 
doesn't look the same at all like a
different<00:05:34.020> body<00:05:34.200> build<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:34.800> everything

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
different body build and everything

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:36.890 
different body build and everything
color<00:05:35.610> runs<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:35.880> lot<00:05:35.940> skinnier<00:05:36.360> it's<00:05:36.659> like<00:05:36.779> on<00:05:36.870> a

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
color runs a lot skinnier it's like on a

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.209 
color runs a lot skinnier it's like on a
foot<00:05:37.169> cloak<00:05:37.409> and<00:05:37.620> everything<00:05:37.860> but<00:05:37.950> it's<00:05:38.070> not

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
foot cloak and everything but it's not

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.800 
foot cloak and everything but it's not
like<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.580> like<00:05:38.729> Haggard<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.330> stuff<00:05:39.539> is<00:05:39.690> this

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
like is like Haggard and stuff is this

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.899 
like is like Haggard and stuff is this
one<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.500> other<00:05:40.620> character<00:05:40.800> yeah<00:05:41.159> the

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
one that this other character yeah the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.610 
one that this other character yeah the
impression<00:05:42.300> I<00:05:42.360> get<00:05:42.450> from<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.840> mask<00:05:43.260> character

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
impression I get from the mask character

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.469 
impression I get from the mask character
is<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:43.889> he's<00:05:44.039> maybe<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.370> little<00:05:44.639> bit<00:05:44.849> older<00:05:45.240> I

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
is that he's maybe a little bit older I

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.839 
is that he's maybe a little bit older I
don't<00:05:45.630> know<00:05:45.750> why<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.409> is<00:05:46.770> it's<00:05:47.340> like<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.669> he

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
don't know why that is it's like that he

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.820 
don't know why that is it's like that he
doesn't<00:05:48.029> quite<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.539> his<00:05:48.659> athletic<00:05:49.229> body

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
doesn't quite have his athletic body

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.070 
doesn't quite have his athletic body
yeah<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:50.909> really<00:05:51.150> like<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.690> guess<00:05:51.840> we<00:05:51.990> don't

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
yeah so really like I guess we don't

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.510 
yeah so really like I guess we don't
really<00:05:52.200> know<00:05:52.529> where<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:52.889> going<00:05:53.190> right

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
really know where this is going right

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.339 
really know where this is going right
it's<00:05:54.060> who<00:05:54.300> knows<00:05:54.539> it's<00:05:54.870> just<00:05:55.050> interesting

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349
