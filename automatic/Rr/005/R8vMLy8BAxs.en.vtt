00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
doing in construction you need a tape

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to run you thirty thirty-five dollars

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.160 
to run you thirty thirty-five dollars
and<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.280> would<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.939> maybe<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> month<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and we would get maybe a month out of it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
and we would get maybe a month out of it
if<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.590> were<00:01:46.710> lucky<00:01:47.000> before<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> would<00:01:48.240> come<00:01:48.509> up

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
if we were lucky before it would come up

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.130 
if we were lucky before it would come up
and<00:01:48.869> no<00:01:49.380> longer<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> reel<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
and no longer would it reel in and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.420 
and no longer would it reel in and
basically<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> throwaway<00:01:52.799> items<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
basically just the throwaway items and

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.909 
ran it down there about six inches long
and<00:04:16.630> they<00:04:16.720> just<00:04:16.930> stick<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:17.230> in<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.350> ground<00:04:17.380> and

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
and they just stick it in the ground and

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.550 
and they just stick it in the ground and
it<00:04:18.430> worked<00:04:18.579> out<00:04:18.700> great<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.690> any<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.049> guys<00:04:20.260> that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
framing something like this is just a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.190 
framing something like this is just a
it's<00:04:29.889> a<00:04:30.040> great<00:04:30.490> great<00:04:31.060> tape<00:04:31.450> measure<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.990> I

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
it's a great great tape measure and I

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.590 
it's a great great tape measure and I
just<00:04:32.440> can't<00:04:32.680> recommend<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.250> enough<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
just can't recommend it enough the the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.330 
just can't recommend it enough the the
black<00:04:34.810> tape<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.260> see<00:04:35.440> on<00:04:35.590> here<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.010> an

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
black tape you see on here is just an

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.000 
black tape you see on here is just an
electrical<00:04:36.820> tape<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.840> just<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.320> just<00:04:38.800> wrap

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
electrical tape and I just I just wrap

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.520 
electrical tape and I just I just wrap
that<00:04:39.040> on<00:04:39.340> there<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.790> keep<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.990> end<00:04:41.169> stiff

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
that on there to keep the end stiff

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.700 
that on there to keep the end stiff
because<00:04:42.100> it'll<00:04:42.370> flop<00:04:43.240> over<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:43.840> that's<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
because it'll flop over so that's the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.890 
because it'll flop over so that's the
