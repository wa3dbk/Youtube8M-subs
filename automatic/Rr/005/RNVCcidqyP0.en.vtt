00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
like a hundred players on that court at

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410 
like a hundred players on that court at
the<00:01:58.229> same<00:01:58.439> time<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.850> playing<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the same time not all playing at the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
the same time not all playing at the
same<00:02:00.540> time<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.140> basically<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.680> you're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
same time but it's basically like you're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
same time but it's basically like you're
in<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> lobby<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.270> hundred<00:02:03.659> different<00:02:03.780> my

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
in a lobby with a hundred different my

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.429 
in a lobby with a hundred different my
players<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.460> playing<00:02:05.700> street<00:02:06.090> ball

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
players and you're playing street ball

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.589 
players and you're playing street ball
so<00:02:07.439> maybe<00:02:07.680> there's<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> voice<00:02:08.340> chat<00:02:08.759> maybe

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so maybe there's a voice chat maybe

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.900 
so maybe there's a voice chat maybe
you're<00:02:09.929> waiting<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.470> between<00:02:10.830> games<00:02:11.160> then

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you're waiting in between games then

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.070 
you're waiting in between games then
you're<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.239> pick<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.569> other<00:02:12.750> people

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you're going to pick up other people

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
you're going to pick up other people
that<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that are

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.600 
that are
you<00:02:13.830> know<00:02:13.920> maybe<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.520> an

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you know maybe it's going to be an

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.190 
you know maybe it's going to be an
environment<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
environment like that that's what it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.760 
environment like that that's what it
seems<00:02:16.440> like

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
seems like

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.160 
seems like
and<00:02:16.980> since<00:02:17.910> multiple<00:02:18.450> games<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.110> be

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and since multiple games are going to be

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
and since multiple games are going to be
going<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> same<00:02:20.130> time<00:02:20.400> you'll<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.820> able

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
going on at the same time you'll be able

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
going on at the same time you'll be able
to<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.420> somebody<00:02:21.750> else's<00:02:22.170> game<00:02:22.410> another

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
to see somebody else's game another

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
to see somebody else's game another
full-court<00:02:23.340> game<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.210> you're

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
full-court game going on as you're

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420 
full-court game going on as you're
playing<00:02:24.690> your<00:02:24.900> game<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.370> if

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
playing your game now I don't know if

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.010 
playing your game now I don't know if
there's<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:26.850> any<00:02:27.060> referees<00:02:27.720> or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
there's going to be any referees or

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.590 
there's going to be any referees or
anything<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.530> probably<00:02:29.160> not<00:02:29.600> should

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
anything like that probably not should

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.090 
anything like that probably not should
be<00:02:30.630> interesting<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.320> can't<00:02:31.560> wait<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.830> see<00:02:32.010> how

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
be interesting I can't wait to see how

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.180 
be interesting I can't wait to see how
that<00:02:32.160> works<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.170> learn<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.920> game

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that works then we learn that this game

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.710 
that works then we learn that this game
is<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.610> running<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> new<00:02:36.420> engine

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
is going to be running on a new engine

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.020 
is going to be running on a new engine
it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.650> using<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.190> same<00:02:38.430> engine<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
it's not using the same engine that the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
it's not using the same engine that the
current<00:02:39.360> gen<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.530> means<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.980> game

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
current gen is on so that means the game

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.730 
current gen is on so that means the game
is<00:02:41.520> not<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.000> behave<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.440> current

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
is not going to behave like the current

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.620 
is not going to behave like the current
gen<00:02:43.890> version<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:45.000> also<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> be

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
gen version there's also going to be

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.130 
gen version there's also going to be
real<00:02:45.959> foot<00:02:46.350> planting<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.150> maybe<00:02:48.450> things<00:02:48.840> like

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
real foot planting so maybe things like

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.560 
real foot planting so maybe things like
speed<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.860> court<00:02:50.340> spacing<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> closeout

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
speed and court spacing and closeout

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
speed and court spacing and closeout
defense<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.459> way<00:02:53.670> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
defense it's not going to be the way it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
defense it's not going to be the way it
is<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> current<00:02:54.450> gen<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.590> new

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
is on the current gen with this new

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.830 
is on the current gen with this new
engine<00:02:56.130> that's<00:02:56.489> what<00:02:56.640> I'm<00:02:56.730> hoping<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.150> when

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
engine that's what I'm hoping for when

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.390 
engine that's what I'm hoping for when
we<00:02:57.959> get<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.380> some<00:02:58.620> gameplay<00:02:59.070> that's<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
we get to see some gameplay that's the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.530 
we get to see some gameplay that's the
first<00:02:59.640> thing<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.120> look<00:03:00.270> at<00:03:00.420> I'm

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
first thing I'm going to look at I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.120 
first thing I'm going to look at I'm
going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> look<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.050> rebounding<00:03:01.680> I'm

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
going to look at the rebounding I'm

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280 
going to look at the rebounding I'm
gonna<00:03:02.280> look<00:03:02.459> at<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> speed<00:03:03.090> I'm<00:03:03.810> gonna<00:03:04.110> look

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
gonna look at the speed I'm gonna look

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.870 
gonna look at the speed I'm gonna look
at<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> closeout<00:03:05.010> speed<00:03:05.340> defensive

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
at the closeout speed defensive

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.330 
at the closeout speed defensive
rotations<00:03:06.600> look<00:03:06.959> at<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.200> foot<00:03:07.440> planning<00:03:07.920> but

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
rotations look at the foot planning but

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.760 
rotations look at the foot planning but
I<00:03:08.550> am<00:03:08.760> extremely<00:03:09.090> excited<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:10.200> hear<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
I am extremely excited to hear that this

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.830 
I am extremely excited to hear that this
game<00:03:11.040> has<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> new<00:03:11.640> engine<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.360> means<00:03:12.630> it's

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
game has a new engine that means it's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.199 
game has a new engine that means it's
not<00:03:13.020> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.350> behave<00:03:13.470> like<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.700> version<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
not going to behave like this version of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.110 
not going to behave like this version of
the<00:03:15.330> game<00:03:15.360> I'm<00:03:15.690> playing<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.350> video<00:03:17.120> next

because if your players aren't happy you

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.310 
because if your players aren't happy you
can<00:03:50.940> actually<00:03:51.090> get<00:03:51.420> fired<00:03:51.810> from<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.290> team

they're not happy now this sounds good

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.850 
they're not happy now this sounds good
but<00:04:03.150> I'm<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.360> little<00:04:03.720> skeptical<00:04:04.380> because<00:04:04.680> we

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
but I'm a little skeptical because we

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.880 
but I'm a little skeptical because we
already<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.470> association<00:04:07.470> mode<00:04:07.680> on

already have this in association mode on
the<00:04:08.040> Kuragin<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:08.640> been<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.060> for

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the Kuragin it's been like this for

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.380 
the Kuragin it's been like this for
years<00:04:09.329> we've<00:04:10.049> had<00:04:10.290> emotions<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.390> player

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
years we've had emotions and player

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.360 
years we've had emotions and player
personalities<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.590> doesn't<00:04:13.980> work<00:04:14.160> out

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
personalities and it doesn't work out

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
personalities and it doesn't work out
right<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.269> way<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.480> does<00:04:15.690> encourage<00:04:16.019> it

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
right the way it does encourage it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.620 
right the way it does encourage it
maybe<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.310> next-gen<00:04:17.880> version<00:04:18.329> will<00:04:18.510> be

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
maybe the next-gen version will be

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.960 
maybe the next-gen version will be
better<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.229> here's<00:04:20.100> an<00:04:20.310> example<00:04:20.640> from

unrealistic<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.590> don't<00:05:20.830> mean<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.160> come<00:05:21.370> off

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
unrealistic so I don't mean to come off

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.029 
unrealistic so I don't mean to come off
negative<00:05:22.120> here<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.440> sounds<00:05:23.740> so

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
negative here but it just sounds so

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.740 
negative here but it just sounds so
similar<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.060> something<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.479> we<00:05:25.630> already

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
similar to something that we already

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.320 
similar to something that we already
have<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.110> current<00:05:26.410> gen<00:05:26.620> hey<00:05:27.190> next-gen<00:05:27.970> version

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
have in current gen hey next-gen version

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.790 
have in current gen hey next-gen version
maybe<00:05:28.570> it's<00:05:28.810> much<00:05:29.080> better<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.620> it's<00:05:29.740> not

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
maybe it's much better and it's not

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.779 
maybe it's much better and it's not
going<00:05:30.010> to<00:05:30.070> be<00:05:30.160> like<00:05:30.370> that

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
going to be like that

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.969 
going to be like that
that's<00:05:31.300> what<00:05:31.570> I'm<00:05:31.690> hoping<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.260> then<00:05:32.860> of
