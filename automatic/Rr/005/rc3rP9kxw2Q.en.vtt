just if we were to criticize just lost a

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.900 
just if we were to criticize just lost a
bit<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.079> quarters<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.980> first<00:00:55.280> part<00:00:55.640> of

bit of the quarters in the first part of
the<00:00:56.149> half<00:00:56.329> past<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:56.870> then<00:00:57.019> of<00:00:57.140> course<00:00:57.410> it

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
the half past but then of course it

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.329 
the half past but then of course it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
really straight change the riders aides

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:38.470 
really straight change the riders aides
are<00:04:24.600> really<00:04:25.650> discreet

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.420 

keeping<00:04:39.480> really<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.020> same<00:04:40.290> cantor<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.010> in

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
keeping really the same cantor in the in

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580 
keeping really the same cantor in the in
the<00:04:41.760> half<00:04:41.940> passes<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.690> no<00:04:42.870> change<00:04:43.230> in<00:04:43.440> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the half passes and no change in the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.100 
the half passes and no change in the
rhythm<00:04:43.790> no<00:04:44.790> change<00:04:45.090> in<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.390> balance<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
rhythm no change in the balance the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.950 
rhythm no change in the balance the
horse<00:04:46.350> stays<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:47.700> uphill<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.360> think<00:04:48.810> we've

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
horse stays just as uphill I think we've

00:04:48.960 --> 00:05:04.710 
horse stays just as uphill I think we've
got<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.140> tiny<00:04:50.270> mistake<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.600> corner

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.870 

so<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.900> all<00:05:06.050> depends<00:05:06.410> how<00:05:06.530> we're<00:05:06.890> picky<00:05:07.520> we

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
so it all depends how we're picky we

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:19.950 
so it all depends how we're picky we
want<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.240> be

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.830 

we<00:05:20.560> had<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.919> one<00:05:21.520> stride<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.270> little<00:05:22.720> bit

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
we had just one stride a little bit

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.059 
we had just one stride a little bit
larger<00:05:23.740> but<00:05:23.949> the<00:05:24.069> rest<00:05:24.280> was<00:05:24.660> really<00:05:25.660> nice<00:05:26.069> the

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
larger but the rest was really nice the

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.219 
larger but the rest was really nice the
impressive<00:05:27.610> product<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:28.180> think<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:28.750> the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
impressive product I think is that the

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.339 
impressive product I think is that the
counter<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.770> always<00:05:30.520> staying<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.780> same<00:05:31.810> every

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
counter is always staying the same every

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.620 
counter is always staying the same every
stride<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.830> really<00:05:33.130> similar<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.419> previous

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
stride is really similar to the previous

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.659 
stride is really similar to the previous
into<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.349> next<00:05:35.650> one<00:05:35.830> which<00:05:36.069> makes<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.580> a

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
into the next one which makes it a

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.170 
into the next one which makes it a
really<00:05:36.849> solid<00:05:37.180> right<00:05:37.509> general<00:05:38.410> impression<00:05:39.180> is

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
really solid right general impression is

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.180 
really solid right general impression is
really<00:05:40.810> excellent<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.440> second<00:05:41.830> pirouette

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
really excellent the second pirouette

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.330 
really excellent the second pirouette
was<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.460> very<00:05:43.030> good<00:05:43.360> i<00:05:46.139> think<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.259> horse<00:05:47.470> always

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
was a very good i think the horse always

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.370 
was a very good i think the horse always
stays<00:05:48.610> in<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:48.910> same<00:05:49.120> frame<00:05:49.539> in<00:05:49.810> his<00:05:50.139> neck

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
stays in the same frame in his neck

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.629 
stays in the same frame in his neck
keeps<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.580> same<00:05:51.819> rhythm<00:05:53.130> that's<00:05:54.130> what<00:05:54.370> makes

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
keeps the same rhythm that's what makes

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.969 
keeps the same rhythm that's what makes
the<00:05:55.479> difference<00:05:55.630> i<00:05:56.020> think<00:05:56.259> it<00:05:56.410> by<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.680> end<00:05:56.919> of

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
the difference i think it by the end of

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.879 
the difference i think it by the end of
the<00:05:57.130> test<00:05:57.370> of<00:05:58.050> course<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.229> quality<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.710> the

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
the test of course the quality of the

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.650 
the test of course the quality of the
horse<00:06:00.070> and<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.310> training<00:06:00.639> but<00:06:01.000> also<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.419> fact

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
horse and the training but also the fact

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.330 
horse and the training but also the fact
that<00:06:01.810> it's<00:06:03.960> solid<00:06:04.960> throughout<00:06:05.470> every<00:06:06.039> single

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
that it's solid throughout every single

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:23.950 
that it's solid throughout every single
movement

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.249 

that<00:06:24.650> really<00:06:24.889> is<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.250> perfect<00:06:25.569> final<00:06:26.569> line<00:06:26.990> the

that really is a perfect final line the

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.629
