00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
electric sockets now as for the death of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359 
electric sockets now as for the death of
electro<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> might<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.130> by<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
electro what we might see is that by the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.780 
electro what we might see is that by the
end<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> movie<00:01:12.119> electro<00:01:12.960> sort<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
end of the movie electro sort of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
end of the movie electro sort of
overcharges<00:01:14.790> himself<00:01:15.299> most<00:01:15.960> likely<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
overcharges himself most likely with the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.999 
overcharges himself most likely with the
help<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> Spidey<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:18.659> simply<00:01:19.009> vaporizes

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
help of Spidey and he simply vaporizes

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460 
help of Spidey and he simply vaporizes
we<00:01:20.790> won't<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.180> his<00:01:21.360> body<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.840> anything<00:01:22.200> like

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
we won't see his body or anything like

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.249 
we won't see his body or anything like
that<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> presumably<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.540> audience<00:01:25.020> will

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that so presumably the audience will

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679

think<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> guy<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.189> dead<00:01:26.729> while<00:01:27.540> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
think that the guy is dead while in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.960 
think that the guy is dead while in
reality<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.040> travels<00:01:29.430> through<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
reality he actually travels through a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510
