00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
no attachments so I couldn't use a grip

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.640 
no attachments so I couldn't use a grip
to<00:00:09.480> try<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.690> improve<00:00:09.929> what<00:00:10.080> accuracy<00:00:10.620> I

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to try to improve what accuracy I

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.259 
to try to improve what accuracy I
couldn't<00:00:11.190> use<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> scope<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.820> try<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.000> get<00:00:12.150> rid

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
couldn't use a scope to try to get rid

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.390 
couldn't use a scope to try to get rid
of<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.480> terrible<00:00:12.960> iron<00:00:13.170> sights<00:00:13.559> nothing<00:00:14.309> at

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of it's terrible iron sights nothing at

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.310 
of it's terrible iron sights nothing at
all<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.900> some

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
all and then see if I can go on some

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
all and then see if I can go on some
kill<00:00:16.500> streaks<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> normally<00:00:18.060> with

kill streaks with it and normally with

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900 
kill streaks with it and normally with
attachments<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:20.220> say<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
attachments I would say that this is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
attachments I would say that this is
still<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.050> mediocre<00:00:22.470> gun<00:00:23.010> or<00:00:23.130> even<00:00:23.460> actually

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
still a mediocre gun or even actually

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.120 
still a mediocre gun or even actually
even<00:00:23.970> below<00:00:24.300> average<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.529> gun<00:00:25.710> does

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
even below average like the gun does

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
even below average like the gun does
have<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.789> redeeming<00:00:27.060> quality<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
have one redeeming quality to it and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
have one redeeming quality to it and
that<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.619> accurate<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.310> does

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that it is that it is accurate it does

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
that it is that it is accurate it does
have<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.029> manageable<00:00:30.300> recoil<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
have a very manageable recoil it's got a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.459 
have a very manageable recoil it's got a
vertical<00:00:31.769> recoil<00:00:32.239> 0.24<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.630> left<00:00:33.840> kick<00:00:33.960> 0.2

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
vertical recoil 0.24 and a left kick 0.2

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.560 
vertical recoil 0.24 and a left kick 0.2
and<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> 0.1<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.300> very

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and a right of 0.1 so this is a very

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.209 
and a right of 0.1 so this is a very
accurate<00:00:36.870> weapon<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> also<00:00:37.770> doesn't<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
accurate weapon it also doesn't have a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
accurate weapon it also doesn't have a
lot<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> bullet<00:00:38.640> deviation<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.590> these

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
lot of bullet deviation but all of these

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.420 
lot of bullet deviation but all of these
other<00:00:40.829> attributes<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.809> don't<00:00:42.809> work<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.620> for

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
other attributes just don't work for for

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
other attributes just don't work for for
our<00:00:44.670> carbide<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.320> we'll

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
our carbide and because of this we'll

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
our carbide and because of this we'll
get<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.489> details<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
get into that if more details here in a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.020 
get into that if more details here in a
second<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.039> struggles<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
second it's just struggles like this is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
second it's just struggles like this is
not<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.780> good<00:00:51.960> weapon<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.680> would<00:00:52.829> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
not a very good weapon and I would not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.380 
not a very good weapon and I would not
recommend<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.489> normally<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> especially

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
recommend it normally and especially

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
recommend it normally and especially
with<00:00:54.750> using<00:00:55.320> no<00:00:55.440> attachments<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.460> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
with using no attachments at all it just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
with using no attachments at all it just
turns<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.539> pile<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> trash<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
turns into a pile of trash and so the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
turns into a pile of trash and so the
biggest<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.640> holding<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> type<00:01:00.510> 95<00:01:00.930> B

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
biggest thing holding back the type 95 B

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.219 
biggest thing holding back the type 95 B
is<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.250> doesn't<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.989> any

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
is that it doesn't really do well in any

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960 
is that it doesn't really do well in any
single<00:01:04.500> type<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> combat<00:01:05.280> scenario<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
single type of combat scenario it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.310 
single type of combat scenario it
doesn't<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.390> well<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.750> close

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
doesn't do well up close

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410 
doesn't do well up close
it's<00:01:07.439> alright<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.280> medium<00:01:08.580> range<00:01:08.790> combat<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's alright at medium range combat and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
it's alright at medium range combat and
you<00:01:09.930> normally<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.340> would

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you normally would think that this would

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
you normally would think that this would
be<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.670> amazing<00:01:11.909> long-range<00:01:12.720> weapon<00:01:13.110> which

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
be an amazing long-range weapon which

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
be an amazing long-range weapon which
we'll<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> second<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we'll get to here in a second but if you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
we'll get to here in a second but if you
go<00:01:14.880> against<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.390> much<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.869> assault<00:01:16.320> rifle

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
go against pretty much any assault rifle

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.929 
go against pretty much any assault rifle
out<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.280> gonna<00:01:17.580> mop<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
out there they're just gonna mop the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
out there they're just gonna mop the
floor<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> definitely<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
floor with you this is definitely not a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
floor with you this is definitely not a
weapon<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.450> close

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
weapon and that you want to use up close

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
weapon and that you want to use up close
and<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.020> simply<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.920> doesn't

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and that's simply because it doesn't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
and that's simply because it doesn't
have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> very<00:01:23.880> fast<00:01:24.150> rounds<00:01:24.659> per<00:01:24.810> minute<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have a very fast rounds per minute and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.039 
have a very fast rounds per minute and
only<00:01:25.259> clocks<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.950> 650<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> go

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
only clocks in at 650 and so if you go

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
only clocks in at 650 and so if you go
toe-to-toe<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.680> someone<00:01:29.130> who<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.430> using

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
toe-to-toe with someone who was using

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
toe-to-toe with someone who was using
pretty<00:01:30.119> much<00:01:30.329> any<00:01:30.659> other<00:01:31.049> carbine<00:01:31.650> pretty

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
are gonna have to be extremely accurate

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
are gonna have to be extremely accurate
you're<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:35.880> sure<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.390> line

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you're gonna have to make sure you line

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.090 
you're gonna have to make sure you line
up<00:01:36.659> every<00:01:37.049> single<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.619> shots<00:01:37.920> you're

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
up every single one of your shots you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.410 
up every single one of your shots you're
probably<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.430> need<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> get

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
probably gonna need you can need to get

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
probably gonna need you can need to get
a<00:01:39.450> couple<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> headshots<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.619> well

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a couple of headshots in there as well

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
a couple of headshots in there as well
and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.579> possible<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.630> do

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and then as possible like you can do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
and then as possible like you can do
well<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.259> close<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> headshot

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
well look close if you are a headshot

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
well look close if you are a headshot
machine<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.420> since<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.780> don't<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.439> very

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
machine and since you don't have a very

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.060 
machine and since you don't have a very
a<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.490> crazy<00:01:47.790> recoil<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.960> possible<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
a very crazy recoil it is possible but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
a very crazy recoil it is possible but
because<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> slower<00:01:50.880> rpm<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> just

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
because of that slower rpm this is just

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.210 
because of that slower rpm this is just
simply<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> weapon<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.100> gonna

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
simply not a weapon that you're gonna

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889 
simply not a weapon that you're gonna
want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.970> those<00:01:54.119> types<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.600> combat

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
want to use in those types of combat

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
want to use in those types of combat
scenarios<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> try<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> take

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
scenarios and then when you try to take

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
scenarios and then when you try to take
it<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.000> long<00:01:57.509> range<00:01:57.810> combat<00:01:58.049> where<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.590> would

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it for long range combat where you would

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
it for long range combat where you would
assume<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> type<00:01:59.549> magnify<00:01:59.939> B<00:02:00.119> would

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
assume that the type magnify B would

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.600 
assume that the type magnify B would
excel<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.110> slow<00:02:01.350> rpm<00:02:01.610> amazing

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
excel because of that slow rpm amazing

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.730 
excel because of that slow rpm amazing
recoil<00:02:03.060> pattern<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.540> nice<00:02:03.780> bullet<00:02:04.170> deviation

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
recoil pattern and nice bullet deviation

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
recoil pattern and nice bullet deviation
you<00:02:05.250> run<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> problem<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
you run them the problem that it doesn't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
you run them the problem that it doesn't
do<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> damage<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.129> distance<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:09.090> is

do a lot of damage at a distance this is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
do a lot of damage at a distance this is
a<00:02:09.539> carbine<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.590> dice<00:02:10.860> did<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.160> want

a carbine and because dice did not want

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.090 
a carbine and because dice did not want
to<00:02:11.400> give<00:02:11.520> every<00:02:11.760> single<00:02:12.060> class<00:02:12.270> access<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
long range amazing assault rifle they

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.130 
long range amazing assault rifle they
had<00:02:16.250> reduced<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.880> damage<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.450> distance<00:02:17.990> it

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
had reduced the damage at a distance it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
had reduced the damage at a distance it
does<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> standard<00:02:19.070> 25<00:02:19.430> damage<00:02:19.640> per<00:02:19.880> shot

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
does do the standard 25 damage per shot

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.730 
does do the standard 25 damage per shot
up<00:02:20.150> close<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.900> they<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.290> get<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.470> 50

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
up close but they want to get to 50

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.730 
up close but they want to get to 50
meters<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.340> only<00:02:22.490> does<00:02:23.110> 15.4<00:02:24.110> damage<00:02:24.590> in

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
meters out it only does 15.4 damage in

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.860 
meters out it only does 15.4 damage in
those<00:02:25.040> circumstances<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:26.690> you're

standard assault rifle or especially if
they're<00:02:30.500> using<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.190> SI<00:02:31.670> R<00:02:31.910> which<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.180> miles

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
they're using the SI R which is miles

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.590 
they're using the SI R which is miles
ahead<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.860> type<00:02:34.040> 95<00:02:34.340> B<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:35.300> gonna<00:02:35.420> get

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
ahead of the type 95 B you're gonna get

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.120 
ahead of the type 95 B you're gonna get
blown<00:02:35.750> away<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.440> takes<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.650> extra

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
blown away because it takes one extra

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
them and you guys know when you're using

them and you guys know when you're using
a<00:02:40.460> very<00:02:40.490> slow<00:02:41.030> rpm<00:02:41.270> weapon<00:02:41.960> especially<00:02:42.620> for

a very slow rpm weapon especially for

a very slow rpm weapon especially for
long<00:02:42.950> range<00:02:43.160> combat<00:02:43.490> where<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
long range combat where it can be a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.430 
long range combat where it can be a
little<00:02:44.300> bit<00:02:44.390> harder<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.780> trickier<00:02:45.140> for<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
little bit harder and trickier for you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.690 
little bit harder and trickier for you
to<00:02:45.620> make<00:02:45.800> sure<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.190> lining<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.490> all

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
to make sure that you're lining up all

of your shots that one extra bullet is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.470 
of your shots that one extra bullet is
gonna<00:02:49.580> feel<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.090> gonna<00:02:50.210> take<00:02:50.270> an

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
gonna feel like it's gonna take an

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.550 
gonna feel like it's gonna take an
eternity<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.050> they're<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.290> they're<00:02:51.500> just

eternity and they're just they're just

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740 
eternity and they're just they're just

all this wasn't enough it also has a

the point where I have no idea why
didn't<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:03.890> slow<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.400> shortens<00:03:05.060> the

and as long as you take you three point
four<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:10.910> an<00:03:11.390> eternity

four that is an eternity

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.870 
four that is an eternity

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
seconds like I just don't understand why

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.370 
seconds like I just don't understand why
the<00:03:29.750> type<00:03:30.080> 95<00:03:30.500> B<00:03:30.770> has<00:03:31.280> such<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.820> slow<00:03:32.380> reload

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the type 95 B has such a slow reload

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.530 
the type 95 B has such a slow reload
speed<00:03:33.770> like<00:03:33.980> sure<00:03:34.280> yeah<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.150> got<00:03:35.360> an

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
speed like sure yeah it's it's got an

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.620 
speed like sure yeah it's it's got an
amazing<00:03:35.680> recoil<00:03:36.680> pattern<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.520> ak5c<00:03:38.180> also

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
amazing recoil pattern but the ak5c also

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.720 
amazing recoil pattern but the ak5c also
has<00:03:38.780> an<00:03:38.930> amazing<00:03:39.380> recoil<00:03:39.920> pattern<00:03:40.220> like<00:03:40.370> it's

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
has an amazing recoil pattern like it's

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.430 
has an amazing recoil pattern like it's
just<00:03:41.000> as<00:03:41.180> manageable<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.870> got<00:03:42.050> basically

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
just as manageable it's got basically

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.530 
just as manageable it's got basically
the<00:03:42.560> same<00:03:42.770> amount<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.250> bullet<00:03:43.490> deviation<00:03:44.120> it's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the same amount of bullet deviation it's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.600 
the same amount of bullet deviation it's
got<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.690> much<00:03:45.020> faster<00:03:45.260> reload<00:03:45.740> speed<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.310> I

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
got a much faster reload speed and I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.590 
got a much faster reload speed and I
honestly<00:03:46.790> can't<00:03:47.180> think<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.570> single

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
honestly can't think of a single

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.810 
honestly can't think of a single
scenario<00:03:48.440> where<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.250> would<00:03:49.280> ever<00:03:49.490> want<00:03:49.610> to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
scenario where you would ever want to

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.750 
scenario where you would ever want to
use<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.210> type<00:03:50.390> 95<00:03:50.690> B<00:03:50.960> over<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.620> ak5c<00:03:52.580> like

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
use the type 95 B over the ak5c like

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.000 
use the type 95 B over the ak5c like
there<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.060> there<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.390> no<00:03:53.690> situation<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.860> my

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
there is there is no situation in my

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.410 
there is there is no situation in my
mind<00:03:55.280> where<00:03:55.460> I'm<00:03:55.520> like<00:03:55.640> yep<00:03:55.880> right<00:03:56.240> there

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
mind where I'm like yep right there

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.880 
mind where I'm like yep right there
that's<00:03:56.660> that's<00:03:57.080> where<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:57.410> gonna<00:03:57.530> excel

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
that's that's where it's gonna excel

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.290 
that's that's where it's gonna excel
like<00:03:58.010> that's<00:03:58.280> where<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.670> would<00:03:58.790> want<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.120> use

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
like that's where you would want to use

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780 
like that's where you would want to use
the<00:03:59.480> type<00:03:59.660> 95<00:03:59.930> B<00:04:00.200> over<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:00.980> gun<00:04:01.160> or<00:04:01.490> really

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
the type 95 B over that gun or really

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.520 
the type 95 B over that gun or really
over<00:04:02.240> any<00:04:02.450> other<00:04:02.690> weapon<00:04:03.050> in<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.200> game<00:04:03.320> like

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
over any other weapon in the game like

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.890 
over any other weapon in the game like
this<00:04:03.740> gun<00:04:04.010> just<00:04:04.580> doesn't<00:04:04.970> make<00:04:05.090> any<00:04:05.300> sense<00:04:05.480> to

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
this gun just doesn't make any sense to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.110 
this gun just doesn't make any sense to
me<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.740> I'm<00:04:07.190> not<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.460> lot<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.640> percent<00:04:07.970> sure

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
me and so I'm not a lot of percent sure

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540 
me and so I'm not a lot of percent sure
why<00:04:08.510> dice<00:04:09.110> went<00:04:09.620> down<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.100> path<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.430> they

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
why dice went down the path that they

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.940 
why dice went down the path that they
did<00:04:10.760> for<00:04:11.000> balancing<00:04:11.420> out<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.720> type<00:04:11.900> 95<00:04:12.200> B<00:04:12.530> it

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
did for balancing out the type 95 B it

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.440 
did for balancing out the type 95 B it

could have been for authenticity I know

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.479 
could have been for authenticity I know
that<00:04:14.780> dice<00:04:14.960> has<00:04:15.230> taken<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.620> firm<00:04:15.830> stance<00:04:16.130> at

that dice has taken a firm stance at

that dice has taken a firm stance at

making sure that all other weapons feel
authentic<00:04:19.070> they<00:04:20.030> definitely<00:04:20.299> took<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.930> firm

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
authentic they definitely took a firm

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.280 
authentic they definitely took a firm
stance<00:04:21.470> with<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.830> g36c<00:04:22.550> they<00:04:22.940> said<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.570> when

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
stance with the g36c they said that when

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.110 
stance with the g36c they said that when
they<00:04:24.440> tested<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:24.890> weapon<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.640> field<00:04:25.910> it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
they tested this weapon in the field it

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.540 
they tested this weapon in the field it
had<00:04:26.270> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
had a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.490 
per minute of 650 and so they absolutely
refused<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:30.210> increase<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.080> do<00:04:31.349> their

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
refused to increase it they do their

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.890 
refused to increase it they do their
credit<00:04:31.800> they<00:04:31.949> did<00:04:32.030> reduce<00:04:33.030> its<00:04:33.419> recoil

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
credit they did reduce its recoil

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.390 
credit they did reduce its recoil
numbers<00:04:34.319> they<00:04:34.470> did<00:04:34.620> make<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.800> should<00:04:35.039> make<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
numbers they did make it should make it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.200 
numbers they did make it should make it
so<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.729> was<00:04:35.819> a<00:04:35.849> little<00:04:36.000> bit<00:04:36.090> more

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
so that it was a little bit more

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.980 
so that it was a little bit more
accurate<00:04:36.629> but<00:04:37.050> they<00:04:37.250> 100%<00:04:38.250> refused<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.360> reduce

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
accurate but they 100% refused to reduce

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.710 
accurate but they 100% refused to reduce
or<00:04:40.289> increase<00:04:40.319> its<00:04:41.250> rpm<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.449> could<00:04:42.569> be

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
or increase its rpm and so that could be

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.450 
or increase its rpm and so that could be
the<00:04:42.810> same<00:04:43.020> thing<00:04:43.259> with<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.650> tight<00:04:43.830> 95b

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
the same thing with the tight 95b

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.430 
the same thing with the tight 95b
maybe<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.210> real<00:04:45.389> world<00:04:45.659> it<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> very

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
maybe in the real world it is a very

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.110 
maybe in the real world it is a very
cumbersome<00:04:47.069> weapon<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.639> it's<00:04:47.759> not<00:04:47.909> very<00:04:48.090> easy

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
cumbersome weapon and it's not very easy

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.450 
cumbersome weapon and it's not very easy
to<00:04:48.360> reload<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.139> that<00:04:49.349> may<00:04:49.680> be<00:04:49.740> why<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.129> has

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
to reload and so that may be why it has

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.719 
to reload and so that may be why it has
such<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.639> long<00:04:50.849> reload<00:04:51.180> time<00:04:51.479> but<00:04:52.199> overall<00:04:52.860> this

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
such a long reload time but overall this

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.050 
such a long reload time but overall this
weapon<00:04:54.210> just<00:04:54.479> is<00:04:55.050> just<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.949> pile<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.460> crap<00:04:56.729> and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
weapon just is just a pile of crap and

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.149 
weapon just is just a pile of crap and
so<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.930> way<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.319> I<00:04:58.409> had<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.680> get<00:04:58.800> gameplay

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
so the way that I had to get gameplay

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.760 
so the way that I had to get gameplay
for<00:04:59.400> today<00:04:59.610> was<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.479> I<00:05:00.509> essentially<00:05:01.259> had<00:05:01.469> to<00:05:01.650> out

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
for today was I I essentially had to out

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.320 
for today was I I essentially had to out
play<00:05:01.949> in<00:05:02.069> my<00:05:02.159> enemy<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.639> had<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.879> get<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.090> drop

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
play in my enemy I had to get the drop

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.240 
play in my enemy I had to get the drop
on<00:05:03.509> them<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.780> had<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.110> go<00:05:04.289> for<00:05:04.500> headshots<00:05:04.680> when

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
on them I had to go for headshots when

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.770 
on them I had to go for headshots when
they<00:05:05.370> were<00:05:05.490> not<00:05:05.610> getting<00:05:05.759> headshots<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.539> had<00:05:06.690> to

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
they were not getting headshots I had to

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.629 
they were not getting headshots I had to
get<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.990> flank<00:05:07.289> use<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.949> terrain<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.340> my

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
get the flank use the terrain to my

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.610 
get the flank use the terrain to my
advantage<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.360> for<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.870> most<00:05:09.990> part<00:05:10.139> try<00:05:10.500> to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
advantage and for the most part try to

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.240 
advantage and for the most part try to
get<00:05:10.860> into<00:05:11.780> medium-range<00:05:12.780> combat<00:05:13.500> scenarios<00:05:14.009> I

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
get into medium-range combat scenarios I

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.580 
get into medium-range combat scenarios I
felt<00:05:14.819> like<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.030> medium<00:05:15.360> ray<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.930> medium<00:05:16.319> game

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
felt like the medium ray the medium game

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.180 
felt like the medium ray the medium game
was<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.370> sweet<00:05:17.639> spot<00:05:17.969> for<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.539> type<00:05:18.750> 95<00:05:19.259> be<00:05:19.560> up

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
was the sweet spot for the type 95 be up

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.249 
was the sweet spot for the type 95 be up
close<00:05:20.580> I'm<00:05:20.819> gonna<00:05:20.909> get<00:05:21.150> dominated<00:05:21.690> because<00:05:22.020> of

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
close I'm gonna get dominated because of

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.100 
close I'm gonna get dominated because of
that<00:05:22.379> slow<00:05:22.590> rpm<00:05:23.099> long<00:05:23.699> range<00:05:24.000> because<00:05:24.389> of<00:05:24.690> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that slow rpm long range because of the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.559 
that slow rpm long range because of the
low<00:05:25.379> damage<00:05:25.590> model<00:05:26.099> but<00:05:26.639> at<00:05:26.789> medium<00:05:27.180> distance

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
low damage model but at medium distance

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.260 
low damage model but at medium distance
it<00:05:28.289> seemed<00:05:28.710> like<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.129> was<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.460> way<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.669> go<00:05:30.030> I

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
it seemed like that was the way to go I

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.209 
it seemed like that was the way to go I
could<00:05:30.449> get<00:05:30.569> I<00:05:30.690> could<00:05:30.750> use<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.529> nice<00:05:31.710> recoil

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
could get I could use the nice recoil

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.620 
could get I could use the nice recoil
pattern<00:05:32.580> my<00:05:32.819> bullets<00:05:33.120> were<00:05:33.240> going<00:05:33.479> where<00:05:33.599> I

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
pattern my bullets were going where I

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.059 
pattern my bullets were going where I
wanted<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.139> because<00:05:34.469> of<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.620> nice<00:05:34.740> bullet

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
wanted to because of the nice bullet

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.189 
wanted to because of the nice bullet
deviation<00:05:35.759> and<00:05:36.000> for<00:05:36.599> the<00:05:36.659> most<00:05:36.779> part<00:05:37.020> that's

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
deviation and for the most part that's

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.140 
deviation and for the most part that's
where<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.590> felt<00:05:38.340> like<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.580> was<00:05:38.699> gonna<00:05:38.789> have<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
where I felt like I was gonna have the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.390 
where I felt like I was gonna have the
most<00:05:39.330> success<00:05:39.719> with<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.860> iron<00:05:41.039> sights

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
most success with this the iron sights

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.089 
most success with this the iron sights
on<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.669> bad<00:05:41.849> boy<00:05:41.880> though<00:05:42.360> oh<00:05:42.770> man<00:05:43.770> were<00:05:43.979> they

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
on this bad boy though oh man were they

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.070 
on this bad boy though oh man were they
a<00:05:44.130> doozy<00:05:44.669> what<00:05:45.210> they<00:05:45.270> reminded<00:05:45.569> me<00:05:45.690> of<00:05:45.719> most

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
a doozy what they reminded me of most

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.709 
a doozy what they reminded me of most
was<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.830> iron<00:05:47.009> sights<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.729> FAMAS<00:05:48.120> back<00:05:48.539> in

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
was the iron sights of the FAMAS back in

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.990 
was the iron sights of the FAMAS back in
battle<00:05:48.990> ax<00:05:49.080> 3<00:05:49.319> they're<00:05:49.919> not<00:05:50.039> as<00:05:50.159> bad<00:05:50.370> as<00:05:50.669> the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
battle ax 3 they're not as bad as the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820 
battle ax 3 they're not as bad as the
battlefield<00:05:51.419> 3<00:05:51.659> FAMAS<00:05:52.080> iron<00:05:52.380> sights<00:05:52.650> if<00:05:52.770> you

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
battlefield 3 FAMAS iron sights if you

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.290 
battlefield 3 FAMAS iron sights if you
remember<00:05:53.069> them<00:05:53.190> they<00:05:53.580> were<00:05:53.639> basically<00:05:54.000> like<00:05:54.270> a

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
remember them they were basically like a

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.820 
remember them they were basically like a
pin<00:05:54.569> hole<00:05:54.750> like<00:05:54.930> they<00:05:55.139> were<00:05:55.199> they<00:05:55.680> were<00:05:55.740> just

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
pin hole like they were they were just

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.350 
pin hole like they were they were just
awful<00:05:56.550> like<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:56.729> can't<00:05:56.940> even<00:05:57.029> believe<00:05:57.210> that

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
awful like I can't even believe that

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.050 
awful like I can't even believe that
dice<00:05:57.750> added<00:05:58.110> them<00:05:58.199> into<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:58.440> game<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:59.370> they

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
dice added them into the game but they

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.570 
dice added them into the game but they
they're<00:06:00.539> not<00:06:00.569> good<00:06:00.990> by<00:06:01.409> any<00:06:01.710> means<00:06:01.949> there<00:06:02.460> were

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
they're not good by any means there were

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.920 
they're not good by any means there were
a<00:06:02.610> lot<00:06:02.759> of<00:06:02.789> moments<00:06:02.940> when<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.330> would<00:06:03.509> completely

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
a lot of moments when I would completely

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.990 
a lot of moments when I would completely
lose<00:06:04.259> my<00:06:04.289> target<00:06:04.919> if<00:06:05.039> they<00:06:05.250> were<00:06:05.310> moving<00:06:05.580> at

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
lose my target if they were moving at

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.119 
lose my target if they were moving at
all<00:06:06.270> if<00:06:06.539> they<00:06:06.690> were<00:06:06.750> ducking<00:06:07.259> behind<00:06:07.409> cover<00:06:07.830> if

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
all if they were ducking behind cover if

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.559 
all if they were ducking behind cover if
they<00:06:08.279> were<00:06:08.340> just<00:06:08.550> trying<00:06:08.849> to<00:06:09.029> avoid<00:06:09.180> my

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
they were just trying to avoid my

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.180 
they were just trying to avoid my
bullets<00:06:09.960> there<00:06:10.379> were<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:10.560> lot<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:10.740> times<00:06:10.919> where

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
bullets there were a lot of times where

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.189 
bullets there were a lot of times where
I<00:06:11.219> just<00:06:11.370> had<00:06:11.699> no<00:06:11.909> idea<00:06:11.940> where<00:06:12.599> they<00:06:12.779> went<00:06:12.960> and

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
I just had no idea where they went and

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.469 
I just had no idea where they went and
so<00:06:13.650> one<00:06:13.949> thing<00:06:13.979> that<00:06:14.190> I<00:06:14.370> quickly<00:06:14.699> learned<00:06:14.969> that

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
so one thing that I quickly learned that

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.180 
so one thing that I quickly learned that
if<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:15.690> wanted<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.139> make<00:06:16.289> sure<00:06:16.319> that<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:16.919> was

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
if I wanted to make sure that I was

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.610 
if I wanted to make sure that I was
tracking<00:06:17.669> my<00:06:17.759> target<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.419> needed<00:06:19.139> to<00:06:19.229> spot<00:06:19.440> my

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
tracking my target I needed to spot my

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.649 
tracking my target I needed to spot my
enemies<00:06:19.949> and<00:06:20.190> while<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.490> pretty<00:06:21.029> much<00:06:21.180> spot<00:06:21.509> as

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
enemies and while I pretty much spot as

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:22.459 
enemies and while I pretty much spot as
often<00:06:21.990> as<00:06:22.139> I<00:06:22.229> can

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
often as I can

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.529 
often as I can
there<00:06:23.159> are<00:06:23.310> some<00:06:23.520> times<00:06:23.699> when<00:06:23.969> the<00:06:24.180> spotted

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
there are some times when the spotted

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.119 
there are some times when the spotted
mechanic<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:24.960> doesn't<00:06:25.529> work<00:06:25.860> or<00:06:26.099> you

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
mechanic just doesn't work or you

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.040 
mechanic just doesn't work or you
spammed<00:06:26.849> it<00:06:26.969> too<00:06:27.120> frequently<00:06:27.569> and<00:06:27.779> you<00:06:27.870> can't

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
spammed it too frequently and you can't

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.480 
spammed it too frequently and you can't
get<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:28.229> spot<00:06:28.440> on<00:06:28.560> them<00:06:28.740> and<00:06:28.919> then<00:06:29.310> I<00:06:29.370> would

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
get the spot on them and then I would

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.890 
get the spot on them and then I would
just<00:06:29.520> completely<00:06:29.940> lose<00:06:30.150> them<00:06:30.389> they<00:06:30.690> would

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
just completely lose them they would

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.450 
just completely lose them they would
duck<00:06:31.080> behind<00:06:31.379> cover<00:06:31.560> for<00:06:31.770> half<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:32.039> second<00:06:32.400> I

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
duck behind cover for half a second I

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.159 
duck behind cover for half a second I
would<00:06:32.520> have<00:06:32.729> no<00:06:32.969> idea<00:06:33.360> where<00:06:33.659> they<00:06:33.810> would<00:06:33.990> win

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
would have no idea where they would win

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.930 
would have no idea where they would win
so<00:06:34.349> I<00:06:34.409> would<00:06:34.529> look<00:06:34.710> around<00:06:34.830> frantically<00:06:35.669> and

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
so I would look around frantically and

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.579 
so I would look around frantically and
then<00:06:36.449> they<00:06:36.690> would<00:06:36.899> of<00:06:37.020> course<00:06:37.199> duck<00:06:37.440> behind

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:37.589 
then they would of course duck behind

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:38.260 
then they would of course duck behind
that<00:06:37.919> little

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
that little

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.490 
that little
that<00:06:38.660> I<00:06:38.690> should<00:06:38.960> have<00:06:39.020> known<00:06:39.200> they<00:06:39.350> were<00:06:39.470> there

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
that I should have known they were there

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.400 
that I should have known they were there
and<00:06:39.920> blast<00:06:40.730> my<00:06:40.970> face<00:06:41.240> full<00:06:41.450> of<00:06:41.510> bullets<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.140> so

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
and blast my face full of bullets and so

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.160 
and blast my face full of bullets and so
the<00:06:42.980> iron<00:06:43.220> sights<00:06:43.610> wild<00:06:44.030> are<00:06:44.210> not<00:06:44.450> as<00:06:44.630> bad<00:06:44.870> as

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
the iron sights wild are not as bad as

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.320 
the iron sights wild are not as bad as
the<00:06:45.620> iron<00:06:45.800> sights<00:06:46.100> from<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.520> FAMAS<00:06:46.820> in<00:06:47.030> benefi

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
the iron sights from the FAMAS in benefi

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.600 
the iron sights from the FAMAS in benefi
3<00:06:47.600> there<00:06:48.500> they're<00:06:48.830> probably<00:06:49.250> one<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.430> the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
3 there they're probably one of the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.100 
3 there they're probably one of the
worst<00:06:49.820> in<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:50.180> game<00:06:50.330> or<00:06:50.510> at<00:06:50.600> least<00:06:50.780> in<00:06:50.960> my

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
worst in the game or at least in my

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.900 
worst in the game or at least in my
opinion<00:06:51.260> like<00:06:51.650> they<00:06:51.980> were<00:06:52.040> one<00:06:52.370> thing<00:06:52.580> that<00:06:52.880> I

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
opinion like they were one thing that I

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.450 
opinion like they were one thing that I
did<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.360> overcome<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.260> so<00:06:54.620> overall<00:06:55.070> I

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
did have to overcome and so overall I

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.490 
did have to overcome and so overall I
don't<00:06:55.760> think<00:06:56.090> I<00:06:56.210> could<00:06:56.390> ever<00:06:56.480> recommend<00:06:57.080> using

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
don't think I could ever recommend using

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.370 
don't think I could ever recommend using
the<00:06:57.950> type<00:06:58.190> 95<00:06:58.520> be<00:06:58.850> to<00:06:59.030> be<00:06:59.150> competitive<00:06:59.510> maybe

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
the type 95 be to be competitive maybe

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.720 
the type 95 be to be competitive maybe
if<00:07:00.590> you<00:07:00.680> want<00:07:00.890> to<00:07:00.980> challenge<00:07:01.160> like<00:07:01.490> if<00:07:01.610> you

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
if you want to challenge like if you

want to use a weapon where you do have
to<00:07:03.290> outperform<00:07:03.530> your<00:07:03.980> enemies<00:07:04.550> then<00:07:05.000> go<00:07:05.210> for

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
to outperform your enemies then go for

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.850 
to outperform your enemies then go for
it<00:07:05.570> like<00:07:05.660> it<00:07:05.810> is<00:07:05.930> a<00:07:05.960> fun<00:07:06.170> challenge<00:07:06.410> like<00:07:06.710> this

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
it like it is a fun challenge like this

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.160 
it like it is a fun challenge like this
actually<00:07:07.400> it<00:07:07.580> is<00:07:07.850> a<00:07:07.880> fun<00:07:08.330> weapon<00:07:08.660> to<00:07:08.750> use<00:07:08.960> if

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
actually it is a fun weapon to use if

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.780 
actually it is a fun weapon to use if
you<00:07:09.650> like<00:07:09.680> to<00:07:10.010> put<00:07:10.160> yourself<00:07:10.550> at<00:07:10.730> a
