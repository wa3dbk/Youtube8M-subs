00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 secondly, new coach Markus Baur has the suspension of his three 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.180
 National player laid 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.040
 since his first day at work, the boss is no longer discussed 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.519
 now demands a defiance reaction 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.039
 He has in his first Bundesliga match as a coach only a trunk troop to 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.800
 disposal 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
 the much scolded Michael Kraus same weakened on the bench 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 Florian Kehrmann rarely ETR thigh strain until further notice 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.419
 like the national team 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.579
 Sebastian Preiss 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.289
 So far from happy for the state of Markus Baur 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 because blue starts nerves 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.660
 Error of the suspended 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 Rolf Herrmann 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.910
 Mentor Nm calls Gang 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.020
 the 1 2 3 after 2 minutes 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 convincing the beginning of the guest 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.830
 the Melsungers would be easy 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 the neighborhood 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.950
 but the Bauer Group is after us 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.910
 with a brilliant directing then her Stefan 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.510
 and a strong Thom Asmuth 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 the balance 8 to 8 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.610
 Bauer satisfied with the fighting attitude of his team 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 but the offensive defense of the Lambo me 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.360
 not and the vote is not right there 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.010
 Engelbert salt on the baur group it not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 that played the host 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.140
 the 9 14 alien view 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.350
 the Greek 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.490
 Olaf h walks here to Michael Hegemann for Bike no chance of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.380
 International will not be in goal 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.200
 Roth Michael Kraus middle of the first half three very 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.060
 a überervös the Fehlpass 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 The Melsungen took their chance 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 and play Ruit the free man 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.210
 Dornier Tellander 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 the 24-year-old Swede 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.020
 on the left outside position 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 Landau still urges trying to get back into the game via tempo 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.339
 nice passport his work on then was going to be 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.559
 the Hungarian market hardly any players this time from the unfamiliar 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:13.409
 outside position 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.799
 the mood in the sold-out rothenbach hall relieves her of pressure 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.639
 as with meters 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.829
 for changes 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.569
 Max ice age 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.759
 the well-rested team behind 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.599
 because calls for transition 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.609
 Gregor is not there 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.319
 six seconds 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.149
 two goals back time-out Markus Baur 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.919
 apn 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 80 million are worldwide 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.219
 he just did not have it 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.869
 but since then there is two steps forward 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.409
 for the hosts from Melsungen after changing Michael Kraus seven-meter 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.639
 his first possibility 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.150
 his first goal after 43 minutes 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.479
 May a defiance reaction look different 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.379
 his flu probably decisive for the poor performance until then 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.499
 and messages always has the right answer with the solar cell 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.889
 Morr 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.889
 National player 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 in it the Melsunger again on offer 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.509
 NPCs this time 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.509
 might be 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.719
 PETA trucks 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.789
 Runners of the national team vorläge 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:44.869
 until then 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.999
 not at all in the game after 45 minutes 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:49.759
 substitute 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.219
 48 minutes his first goal 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.379
 and his national team colleague RPO Isermann 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.159
 in the right backspace 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.159
 now he gets the ball strong his eighth goal 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.069
 he met in total in this game 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.029
 the countries has two goals back 31 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 to 33 after 50 minutes 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.829
 but again and again technical mistakes 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.829
 sneaked in 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 Melbourne again immediately 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.699
 31 if you have plenty 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.309
 Prospect of the mentor of the Lambo 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.309
 Robert Ideas a happy birthday »four goals ago 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.259
 and Michael Kraus with the wrong answer 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
 dictated messages precede 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.530
 loud picture is there in front 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.870
 there the world 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.900
 you are now 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.379
 and dare 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.529
 for text 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.529
 the Kassel Rothenbach hall they 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.249
 according to Liddy's mood 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.839
 Lampard still struggling shortly before the end 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:05.839
 to approve the incredible true nose like teachers 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.349
 The game has long been written off from body language 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.620
 once again in forward gear 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.130
 he is off the markets his third goal 37 back 41 the processing 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.849
 defeat 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.839
 against playfully strong hosts from Melsungen 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.189
 Markus Baur starts his first appearance as a coach 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.830
 thanks to much scolded three internationals, he takes in Chur 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.789
 if, for example, occupied laser measuring instruments playing time 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.289
 say that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.490
 but also with the three perpetrators 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.050
 and not self-critical after poor performance 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.870
 so Australia had to banish itself on the head and is out but we are 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.819
 Young and old 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.819
 in front of the former GDR 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.590
 the clear defeat at the injured stood the farmer no good 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:02.869
 begin 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.539
 This is to rebuild the humble Starz and find peace
