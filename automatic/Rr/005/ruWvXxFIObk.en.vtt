00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:19.080 

all<00:03:57.890> right<00:03:58.040> now<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:58.519> operation<00:04:06.370> remember

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:05:00.920 

make<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.300> come<00:04:20.600> around<00:04:20.750> my<00:04:20.900> shoulder

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:32.340 

officer

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.659 

now<00:05:33.350> multiplied<00:05:33.830> by<00:05:33.979> twenty<00:05:34.310> one<00:05:34.340> on<00:05:34.550> each

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
now multiplied by twenty one on each

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.600 
now multiplied by twenty one on each
side<00:05:35.380> because<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.470> want<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.740> isolate<00:05:36.919> the

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
side because you want to isolate the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.360 
side because you want to isolate the
variable<00:05:37.639> which<00:05:38.300> is<00:05:38.449> a<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:39.169> 21<00:05:39.889> on<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.160> side

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
variable which is a so 21 on the side

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.350 
variable which is a so 21 on the side
divided<00:05:41.300> by<00:05:41.330> like<00:05:41.720> 21<00:05:42.190> divided<00:05:43.190> by<00:05:43.220> 21<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:43.729> x

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
divided by like 21 divided by 21 and x

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.200 
divided by like 21 divided by 21 and x
21<00:05:44.840> cancel<00:05:45.320> each<00:05:45.410> other<00:05:45.500> up<00:05:45.740> so<00:05:46.550> now<00:05:46.759> we<00:05:46.820> need

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
21 cancel each other up so now we need

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:55.650 
21 cancel each other up so now we need
to<00:05:47.330> multiply<00:05:47.590> 25<00:05:51.400> 1006<00:05:52.400> 4<00:05:52.789> &amp;<00:05:53.000> 9<00:05:53.090> for<00:05:54.250> 9<00:05:55.250> equals

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
to multiply 25 1006 4 &amp; 9 for 9 equals

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:21.800 
to multiply 25 1006 4 &amp; 9 for 9 equals
13<00:05:57.190> 6<00:05:58.190> 3<00:05:58.820> 7<00:05:59.330> for<00:06:00.020> a<00:06:01.360> good

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:43.719 

Sara

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.999 

now<00:06:44.729> we're<00:06:45.029> going<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.300> add<00:06:45.629> my<00:06:45.960> eye<00:06:46.439> level

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
now we're going to add my eye level

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:55.670 
now we're going to add my eye level
height<00:06:47.449> so<00:06:49.249> 13563<00:06:50.689> 7/4<00:06:51.689> which<00:06:52.050> was<00:06:54.499> there<00:06:55.499> I'm

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
height so 13563 7/4 which was there I'm

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.469 
height so 13563 7/4 which was there I'm
gonna<00:06:55.860> add<00:06:56.069> my<00:06:56.099> eye<00:06:56.759> level<00:06:57.059> height<00:06:57.330> which<00:06:57.449> is

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
gonna add my eye level height which is

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.469 
gonna add my eye level height which is
approximately<00:06:57.899> 5<00:06:58.680> feet<00:06:58.710> and<00:06:59.279> it's<00:07:00.210> going<00:07:00.419> to

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
approximately 5 feet and it's going to

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.260 
approximately 5 feet and it's going to
eat

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
eat

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.350 
eat
two<00:07:02.930> point<00:07:03.560> six<00:07:03.950> three<00:07:04.460> seven<00:07:05.000> four<00:07:05.770> now<00:07:07.360> we're

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
two point six three seven four now we're

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.610 
two point six three seven four now we're
going<00:07:08.450> to<00:07:08.510> round<00:07:08.720> this<00:07:08.930> answer<00:07:09.320> to<00:07:09.530> the

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
going to round this answer to the

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:28.150 
going to round this answer to the
nearest<00:07:09.860> foot<00:07:10.370> so<00:07:18.520> 219<00:07:21.640> so<00:07:26.320> is<00:07:27.320> approximately

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
nearest foot so 219 so is approximately

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.800 
nearest foot so 219 so is approximately
19<00:07:28.700> feet<00:07:29.710> thank<00:07:30.710> you
