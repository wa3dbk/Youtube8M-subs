00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
called an m12 PA see what it's doing is

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.950 
called an m12 PA see what it's doing is
it's<00:02:03.550> talking<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.030> our<00:02:04.150> products<00:02:04.540> via<00:02:04.690> various

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
it's talking to our products via various

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's talking to our products via various
feel<00:02:05.260> bus<00:02:05.440> technologies<00:02:06.070> things<00:02:06.370> like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
feel bus technologies things like

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.669 
feel bus technologies things like
ethernet/ip<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.780> these<00:02:07.930> two<00:02:08.110> devices<00:02:08.350> over

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
ethernet/ip to these two devices over

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.009 
ethernet/ip to these two devices over
here<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.040> EtherCAT<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.300> larger<00:02:10.630> axis

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
here and EtherCAT to the larger axis

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.020 
here and EtherCAT to the larger axis
with<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.070> able<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.400> act<00:02:12.580> as<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.820> master

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
with that it's able to act as a master

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
with that it's able to act as a master
device<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.630> can<00:02:13.690> display<00:02:14.019> things<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.590> an<00:02:14.680> HMI

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
device it can display things on an HMI

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.860 
device it can display things on an HMI
show<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> how<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.120> actuators<00:02:16.510> are<00:02:16.630> doing

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
show you how your actuators are doing

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.810 
show you how your actuators are doing
what<00:02:17.230> they're<00:02:17.350> where<00:02:17.739> they<00:02:17.890> are<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.160> space<00:02:18.430> how

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
what they're where they are in space how

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.430 
what they're where they are in space how
fast<00:02:19.269> they're<00:02:19.480> moving<00:02:19.510> current<00:02:20.170> state<00:02:20.410> of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
fast they're moving current state of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.770 
fast they're moving current state of
operations<00:02:21.070> things<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:22.600> that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
operations things like that with that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.210 
operations things like that with that
that<00:02:23.110> kind<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.350> concludes<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.830> two<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.070> our

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
that kind of concludes the two of our

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.710 
that kind of concludes the two of our
