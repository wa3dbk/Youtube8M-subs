 vegetable korte six chefs swirl around 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.530
 pots and pans but it's worth it 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.660
 because good food is also for the dear 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 important is that goes through the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.330
 stomach clean with good food you get 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.250
 him off the train 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.910
 here comes the main course at the latest 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.070

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.980
 the dessert uses apple gata tried 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.560
 still with sweetness to win the victory 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.690
 if he succeeds, it will be very difficult 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.130
 but I think that's about the same 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.090
 I would say 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.210
 both cooked well it is done 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.190
 the host also threw the cooking duel 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.650
 he warmly and there were no big ones 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.230

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.210
 evaluation of what will come out 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 I am firmly convinced that we 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.690
 However, only that has won 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.230
 he won so the result remains 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.000
 the host is still the winner 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.520
 durchgeboxt with a gossamer 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.590
 lead but the real winner 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.110
 was the great food on this charming 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.800
