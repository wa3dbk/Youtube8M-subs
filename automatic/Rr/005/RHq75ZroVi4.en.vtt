have normal click funds that have not

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.260 
have normal click funds that have not
been<00:00:39.410> designed<00:00:40.160> either<00:00:40.580> produced<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:42.320> support

been designed either produced to support

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.479 
been designed either produced to support
the<00:00:44.270> adversity<00:00:44.840> in<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.290> broad<00:00:45.500> tent<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.220> broad

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
the adversity in a broad tent the broad

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.860 
the adversity in a broad tent the broad
tent<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.850> have<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:47.059> know<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:47.210> humidity

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
tent you have to know that humidity

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.720 
tent you have to know that humidity
might<00:00:48.739> be<00:00:48.950> very<00:00:49.190> high

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
might be very high

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.630 
might be very high
also<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.780> clip<00:00:50.989> fans<00:00:51.200> are<00:00:51.410> not<00:00:51.650> being

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
also the clip fans are not being

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.960 
also the clip fans are not being
produced<00:00:53.060> to<00:00:53.240> be<00:00:53.270> running<00:00:53.870> 24/7<00:00:54.730> this<00:00:55.730> means

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
produced to be running 24/7 this means

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.450 
produced to be running 24/7 this means
that<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.330> normal<00:00:57.260> engine<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:57.980> clip<00:00:58.190> fan

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
that the normal engine of the clip fan

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.770 
that the normal engine of the clip fan
has<00:00:59.030> oil<00:00:59.450> in<00:00:59.690> this<00:01:00.020> oil<00:01:00.460> being<00:01:01.460> used<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.180> warm

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
has oil in this oil being used and warm

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.890 
has oil in this oil being used and warm
too<00:01:03.050> much<00:01:03.430> disappears<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.720> clip

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
too much disappears and then the clip

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.890 
too much disappears and then the clip
and<00:01:06.080> gets<00:01:06.290> broken<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:08.090> our<00:01:08.210> industry

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
and gets broken so in our industry

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.020 
and gets broken so in our industry
unfortunately<00:01:09.170> there's<00:01:10.100> many<00:01:10.400> returns<00:01:10.820> in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
unfortunately there's many returns in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.510 
unfortunately there's many returns in
shop<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.420> griffin's<00:01:11.960> due<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> fact<00:01:13.190> that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
shop of griffin's due to the fact that

months<00:01:19.090> fun<00:01:20.090> if<00:01:20.540> there<00:01:20.780> are<00:01:20.840> any<00:01:20.930> advantages

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
months fun if there are any advantages

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.310 
months fun if there are any advantages
of<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.280> over<00:01:22.820> any<00:01:23.030> other<00:01:23.300> fun<00:01:23.509> on<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.899> market

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
of this over any other fun on the market

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.770 
of this over any other fun on the market
at<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.500> minute<00:01:24.830> yes<00:01:25.190> there's<00:01:25.490> two<00:01:25.780> big

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
at the minute yes there's two big

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.770 
at the minute yes there's two big
advantages<00:01:27.380> basically<00:01:27.830> with<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.100> clip<00:01:28.399> fun

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
advantages basically with this clip fun

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.900 
advantages basically with this clip fun
first<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.960> all<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.890> have<00:01:31.100> developed<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.759> new

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
first of all we have developed a new

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.109 
first of all we have developed a new
engine<00:01:32.539> which<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:33.080> direct<00:01:33.770> drive<00:01:34.369> magnetic

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
engine which is a direct drive magnetic

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.570 
engine which is a direct drive magnetic
system<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.259> like<00:01:36.410> basically<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.860> DJ<00:01:37.280> plates

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
system it's like basically the DJ plates

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.840 
system it's like basically the DJ plates
so<00:01:38.090> we<00:01:38.360> don't<00:01:38.750> use<00:01:39.020> any<00:01:39.259> more<00:01:39.500> oil<00:01:39.740> which<00:01:40.580> means

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
so we don't use any more oil which means

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.400 
so we don't use any more oil which means
that<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:42.289> find<00:01:42.740> out<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> way<00:01:44.140> have<00:01:45.140> clip

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
that we really find out a way have clip

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.630 
that we really find out a way have clip
funds<00:01:45.709> that<00:01:45.800> can<00:01:46.039> be<00:01:46.630> working<00:01:47.950> 24/7<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.459> wall

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
funds that can be working 24/7 in a wall

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.440 
funds that can be working 24/7 in a wall
tent<00:01:49.910> even<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.509> adversity<00:01:51.580> environment<00:01:52.580> as

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
tent even in a adversity environment as

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.440 
tent even in a adversity environment as
you<00:01:53.509> can<00:01:53.780> see<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.679> clip<00:01:54.890> fund<00:01:55.160> is<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.880> engine

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
you can see the clip fund is the engine

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.559 
you can see the clip fund is the engine
is<00:01:56.569> very<00:01:56.600> very<00:01:57.170> clean<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.940> very<00:01:59.149> simple

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
is very very clean it's a very simple

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.050 
is very very clean it's a very simple
engine<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:02.720> can<00:02:02.899> put<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> wheel<00:02:03.470> very

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
engine and you can put the wheel very

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.469 
engine and you can put the wheel very
easily<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:06.440> this<00:02:06.470> as<00:02:07.039> magnetic<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.330> it's

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
easily like this as magnetic so it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.580 
easily like this as magnetic so it's
just<00:02:08.990> great<00:02:10.390> yes<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.380> first

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
just great yes so this is the first

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.620 
just great yes so this is the first
advantage<00:02:13.099> we<00:02:13.250> can<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:13.640> assure<00:02:14.090> people

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
advantage we can really assure people

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.450 
advantage we can really assure people
that<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.500> one

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
that this one

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.580 
that this one
work<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.880> run<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.210> run<00:02:17.330> 24/7<00:02:17.990> without<00:02:18.380> any

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
work and run and run 24/7 without any

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.340 
work and run and run 24/7 without any
problem<00:02:19.300> another<00:02:20.300> good<00:02:20.540> point<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:21.200> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
problem another good point with this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.370 
problem another good point with this
engine<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.490> could<00:02:22.700> reduce<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:24.080> five

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
engine is that we could reduce to five

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.910 
engine is that we could reduce to five
what<00:02:24.710> only<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.220> consume<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.650> means<00:02:27.860> that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
what only the consume so this means that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.290 
what only the consume so this means that
end-user<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:29.300> do<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.930> saving<00:02:30.740> on<00:02:30.950> their

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
end-user can do a saving on their

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.820 
end-user can do a saving on their
invoice<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> owner<00:02:33.230> Bill<00:02:33.650> of

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
invoice or in the owner Bill of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.810 
invoice or in the owner Bill of
electricity<00:02:34.960> from<00:02:35.960> 20<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.590> 25<00:02:37.100> pounds<00:02:37.580> per

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
electricity from 20 to 25 pounds per

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.470 
electricity from 20 to 25 pounds per
year<00:02:38.710> so<00:02:39.710> if<00:02:39.890> somebody<00:02:40.310> has<00:02:40.370> maybe<00:02:40.730> five<00:02:41.120> six

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
year so if somebody has maybe five six
