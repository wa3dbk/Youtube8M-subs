00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229

their pets like other people do and

another person that's been smoking

another person that's been smoking
that's<00:01:25.070> become<00:01:25.369> because<00:01:25.909> their<00:01:26.090> smell<00:01:26.450> has

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
that's become because their smell has

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.920 
that's become because their smell has
become<00:01:27.350> resistant<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.950> those<00:01:28.130> smells<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
become resistant to those smells the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.990 
become resistant to those smells the
same<00:01:30.110> thing<00:01:30.290> happens<00:01:30.650> with<00:01:30.740> insulin<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.820> more

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
same thing happens with insulin the more

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.850 
same thing happens with insulin the more
you're<00:01:32.119> exposed<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.509> insulin<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.439> more<00:01:33.680> you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
you're exposed to insulin the more you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.910 
you're exposed to insulin the more you
become<00:01:33.979> resistant<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.770> need<00:01:36.890> a

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
become resistant to it so you need a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.710 
become resistant to it so you need a
bunch<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.220> sugar<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:38.060> produce<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.450> bunch<00:01:38.600> of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
bunch of sugar you produce a bunch of

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.749 
bunch of sugar you produce a bunch of
insulin<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.290> then<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.890> become<00:01:40.130> resistant<00:01:40.700> to

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
insulin and then you become resistant to

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.960 
insulin and then you become resistant to
that<00:01:41.329> inside<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.229> can't<00:01:42.439> do<00:01:42.560> its<00:01:42.650> job

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
that inside so it can't do its job

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.140 
that inside so it can't do its job
remember

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
remember

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.230 
remember
it's<00:01:44.720> job<00:01:45.079> is<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.740> force<00:01:46.100> sugar<00:01:46.399> from<00:01:47.180> the

it's job is to force sugar from the

it's job is to force sugar from the
blood<00:01:47.540> into<00:01:48.170> yourselves

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240

tissues of your body that need it the
most<00:02:04.630> they<00:02:05.630> become<00:02:05.899> resistant<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:06.890> fat<00:02:07.159> cells

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
most they become resistant but fat cells

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.059 
most they become resistant but fat cells
do<00:02:07.670> not<00:02:07.700> become<00:02:08.119> resistant<00:02:08.539> right<00:02:08.660> away<00:02:09.069> so

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
do not become resistant right away so

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.589 
do not become resistant right away so
what<00:02:10.190> happens<00:02:10.580> when<00:02:10.819> sugar<00:02:11.150> starts<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> build

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
what happens when sugar starts to build

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.050 
what happens when sugar starts to build
up<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.870> your<00:02:11.900> blood<00:02:12.080> when<00:02:12.890> your<00:02:13.099> muscles<00:02:13.519> your

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
up in your blood when your muscles your

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.089 
up in your blood when your muscles your
brain<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.630> your<00:02:14.750> liver<00:02:14.930> already<00:02:15.800> become

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
brain and your liver already become

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.550 
brain and your liver already become
resistant<00:02:16.580> well<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.569> think<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.050> easy<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.319> see

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
resistant well I think it's easy to see

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.380 
resistant well I think it's easy to see
but<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.550> sugar<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:19.970> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.209> driven

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
but that sugar is going to be driven

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.170 
but that sugar is going to be driven
directly<00:02:20.930> into<00:02:21.230> your<00:02:21.260> fat<00:02:21.560> cells<00:02:22.180> now

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
directly into your fat cells now

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.330 
directly into your fat cells now
eventually<00:02:23.810> your<00:02:24.470> fat<00:02:24.680> cells<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.190> become

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
eventually your fat cells will become

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.580 
eventually your fat cells will become
resistant<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.030> well<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:27.319> there's<00:02:27.470> no

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
resistant as well and then there's no

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.559 
resistant as well and then there's no
place<00:02:27.799> for<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.040> sugar<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:29.239> certain

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
place for the sugar to go the certain

place for the sugar to go the certain

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.620 
matter how much insulin you produce
