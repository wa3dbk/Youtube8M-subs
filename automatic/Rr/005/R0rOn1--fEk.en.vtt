00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.149 
exactly I looked at the WNBA coaches and
it<00:02:55.090> looks<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.299> half<00:02:55.659> of<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.200> coaches<00:02:56.889> on<00:02:57.129> the

it looks like half of the coaches on the

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.640 
it looks like half of the coaches on the
WNBA<00:02:57.909> are<00:02:58.180> men<00:02:58.419> right<00:02:58.870> nobody<00:02:59.230> seems<00:02:59.439> to<00:02:59.560> have

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
WNBA are men right nobody seems to have

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.589 
WNBA are men right nobody seems to have
a<00:02:59.680> problem<00:02:59.889> with<00:03:00.189> that<00:03:00.310> exactly<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.120> my<00:03:01.540> guess

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
a problem with that exactly so my guess

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.240 
a problem with that exactly so my guess
is<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.900> they're<00:03:02.470> gonna<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.859> have<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:02.980> find

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
is that they're gonna just have to find

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.319 
is that they're gonna just have to find
a<00:03:03.370> way<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.579> work<00:03:03.700> together<00:03:03.879> that's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
a way to work together that's

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.149 
a way to work together that's
appropriate<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.930> makes<00:03:05.049> sense<00:03:05.169> for<00:03:05.379> them<00:03:05.530> but

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
appropriate it makes sense for them but

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.429 
appropriate it makes sense for them but
it's<00:03:06.549> not<00:03:06.730> like<00:03:06.879> this<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.060> going<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> huge

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
it's not like this is going to be a huge

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's not like this is going to be a huge
problem<00:03:08.980> or<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> deal-breaker<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.629> means

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
problem or a deal-breaker it just means

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.270 
problem or a deal-breaker it just means
that<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.349> nature<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.799> relationship

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that the nature of the relationship

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.069 
that the nature of the relationship
might<00:03:12.430> change<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.700> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.909> that<00:03:13.629> is<00:03:13.780> part

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
might change a little bit that is part

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.720 
might change a little bit that is part
of<00:03:14.139> why<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.349> is<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.739> fascinating<00:03:14.950> yeah

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
of why this is so fascinating yeah

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.219 
of why this is so fascinating yeah
absolutely<00:03:16.000> fascinating<00:03:16.780> but<00:03:16.840> let<00:03:17.019> us<00:03:17.049> know

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
absolutely fascinating but let us know

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.390 
absolutely fascinating but let us know

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
what you think about this particular

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.619 
what you think about this particular
case<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.699> you<00:03:18.760> think<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.180> we're<00:03:19.329> gonna<00:03:19.389> have

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
case do you think that we're gonna have

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.330 
case do you think that we're gonna have
more<00:03:19.870> female<00:03:20.290> coaches<00:03:20.530> or<00:03:20.919> do<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.099> think<00:03:21.129> that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
more female coaches or do you think that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.860 
more female coaches or do you think that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
Becky Hammon maybe is just an anomaly

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.539 
Becky Hammon maybe is just an anomaly
