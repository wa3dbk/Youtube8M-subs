supervision of dr. Q in for this way we
do<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.109> experiment<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:17.010> determine<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
do this experiment to determine the

do this experiment to determine the
presence<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.119> protein<00:00:18.560> firstly<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.680> may<00:00:19.800> take

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
presence of protein firstly we may take

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.300 
presence of protein firstly we may take
the<00:00:20.640> temple<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> protein<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.560> sample<00:00:23.160> we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the temple of protein into the sample we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.380 
the temple of protein into the sample we
will<00:00:23.430> add<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> few<00:00:24.300> 0.5<00:00:25.260> ml<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> ninhydrin<00:00:26.390> after

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
will add a few 0.5 ml of ninhydrin after

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.689 
will add a few 0.5 ml of ninhydrin after
that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.750> will<00:00:27.869> bond<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.710> few<00:00:29.220> minutes<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that we will bond it a few minutes and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
that we will bond it a few minutes and
then<00:00:30.179> cool<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.480> after<00:00:31.380> cooling<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.830> will

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
then cool it after cooling we will

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
then cool it after cooling we will
observe<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.520> color<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.149> solution<00:00:33.450> will

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
observe that color of this solution will

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
observe that color of this solution will
change<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.380> blue<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.829> indicates<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> presence

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
change to blue it indicates the presence

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:50.119 
change to blue it indicates the presence
