00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
older but that's about it normally when

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.729 
older but that's about it normally when
you<00:03:26.659> see<00:03:26.840> down<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.139> it's<00:03:27.290> going<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.560> start

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
you see down there it's going to start

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.229 
you see down there it's going to start
for<00:03:27.859> me<00:03:27.980> not<00:03:28.069> as<00:03:28.250> warm<00:03:28.400> top<00:03:28.730> because<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.090> is

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
for me not as warm top because this is

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.729 
for me not as warm top because this is
really<00:03:29.420> easily<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.930> down<00:03:30.170> British

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
really easily going down British

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.490 
really easily going down British
destroyers<00:03:31.220> there<00:03:31.519> goes<00:03:31.810> level<00:03:32.810> 31<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.379> too

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
destroyers there goes level 31 on too

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.729 
destroyers there goes level 31 on too
pretty<00:03:34.689> to<00:03:35.689> orem<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.049> gives<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.319> lot<00:03:36.560> of

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
pretty to orem so gives a lot of

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.250 
pretty to orem so gives a lot of
experience<00:03:37.159> I<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.639> hundred<00:03:37.909> seventy

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
experience I think so hundred seventy

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.220 
experience I think so hundred seventy
