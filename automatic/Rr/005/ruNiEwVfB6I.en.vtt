it's a video my winch setup I built for
my<00:00:03.149> boat<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:04.370> $40<00:00:05.370> winch<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.359> bring<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.109> sucks

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
my boat a $40 winch I bring this sucks

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.220 
my boat a $40 winch I bring this sucks
otherwise<00:00:07.919> when<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.220> find<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.820> hit<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:10.019> boat

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230

so I bring that up and now real

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
so I bring that up and now real
important<00:00:13.500> part<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.549> triangles

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
important part is all these triangles

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
important part is all these triangles
right<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.509> keep<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.900> strong<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.220> pulls<00:00:17.490> up

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
right here keep it strong as it pulls up

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.660 
right here keep it strong as it pulls up
here<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.109> brings<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> pressure<00:00:19.800> back<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
here and brings the pressure back that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
here and brings the pressure back that
way<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.300> braces<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.840> against<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
way so then this braces up against the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.450 
way so then this braces up against the
back<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.439> bed<00:00:22.650> I'll<00:00:22.769> show<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> once<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.279> get

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
back of my bed I'll show you once I get

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.080 
back of my bed I'll show you once I get

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it on get out a two by fours and dowel

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.470 
it on get out a two by fours and dowel
some<00:00:27.539> PVC<00:00:27.840> pipe<00:00:28.019> around<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.849> some<00:00:29.849> braces<00:00:30.240> here

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
some PVC pipe around it some braces here

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
some PVC pipe around it some braces here
pulls<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.289> way<00:00:32.149> these<00:00:33.149> go<00:00:33.360> right<00:00:33.390> into<00:00:33.950> these

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
pulls that way these go right into these

00:00:34.950 --> 00:01:13.670 
pulls that way these go right into these
here<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.579> truck<00:00:35.880> no<00:00:36.690> bolts<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.320> anything

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:34.730 

right<00:01:14.680> here<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:19.060> cut<00:01:19.360> absolutely<00:01:19.869> perfect

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.340 

this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.130> load<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.580> boat

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.900 

okay<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.800> stops<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> from<00:01:41.700> falling

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
okay so that stops it from falling

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.580 
okay so that stops it from falling
forward<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:45.270> piece<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:46.050> these<00:01:46.380> are

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
forward this piece here these are

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.110 
forward this piece here these are
rollers

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.770 

I<00:02:08.129> cut<00:02:09.129> these<00:02:09.340> right<00:02:09.670> here<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.269> fit<00:02:10.599> the
