00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.099
 today 's movie food is a delight 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.460
 chocolate cake filled with 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.900
 chocolate and chocolate coating 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.970
 matilda in my favorite movies 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.010
 When I was a child, I was dying of envy 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.470
 the fat man who was forced to eat a 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.169
 giant cake by the school principal 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:29.499
 Just the way I'm going to start today. 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.659
 showing dry 240 grammes of 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.659
 wheat flour what the two cups 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.430
 Sift flour together with a spoon 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.899
 of chemical yeast soup and a cup 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.899
 and average chocolate powder 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.530
 if you want to use chocolate powder or cocoa 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.179
 also can but I think the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.449
 chocolatado has a lot more like 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.449
 childhood 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.000
 in a bowl to 3 gems 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.000
 Clear, come back later. 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.330
 in the flames mixed sugar mexico 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.910
 refined and mexico was brown sugar 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.860
 break the cake gets more chopped hit 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.370
 quickly to absorb the sugars 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.540
 And I add a cup of milk and mexico. 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.030
 is vegetable oil 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.200
 mix well and gradually add 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.200
 the mixture of centuries 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.000
 now beat the egg whites in a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.829
 bowl clean and with no fat 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 with a pinch of salt 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.130
 here I'll do it in the hand but I can do it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.130
 in the mixer that is easier 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.610
 when the whites are firm and 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.610
 lightly incorporating the mouth mix 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.560
 then along with butter and flour as well 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 a round shape 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.350
 this is essential to not stick now 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.869
 I take cake to bake in an oven 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.330
 preheated at medium power for what 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.890
 if I am a means to bind him by 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 at least 15 minutes before he 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.349
 can reach the ideal temperature to be 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.930
 love left holy for about 30 to 40 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.519
 minutes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.769
 Meanwhile make the filling the cover 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.180
 I've already chopped 250 grams of 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.340
 half bitter chocolate 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.870
 What 's the use of a barrier here? 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.420
 using bitter means so that it stays 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.510
 very dark as in the film the most flowers 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.459
 Antoinette of the procel is the milk and light 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 to low heat with the pan with 250 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.489
 grams of cream or cream of fresh milk 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.900
 until boiling 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.790
 here i am using the same amount 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.299
 of cream and chocolate that I want 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.430
 stay a softer ganache cream range 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.109
 hot on chocolate and stir until 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.109
 which melts completely 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.810
 the cake is ready to know if you're already 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.970
 good, just do the old 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 political spectacle if you turn tanquinho 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.640
 It's because it's ready to just wait to cool down. 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.989
 a bit the cake is already cold I untangle and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.989
 put into practice the work 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.270
 with a nylon cord makes a well round the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.400
 half the cake to divide into two 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.530
 layers the nylon wire is more resistant 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.460
 but a sewing line can be used 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.560
 also 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.140
 then just pull the line the cake goes 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.760
 stay well behaved in half 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.260
 I want to make a goal like that of the movie. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.690
 with four layers 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.240
 so here I made another cake and fold it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.280
 ganache recipe if you want to do the same 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.720
 mine is just doubling all the revenue 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.810
 but when the layers is already a 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.810
 delicious 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.950
 now it's just me I finish layers of stuffing 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.240
 and cake 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.230
 You have to be careful not to break 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.790
 so always very gently 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.380
 after all the calls made by the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.540
 roof 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.540
 I also cover all sides 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 I never thought you'd do my thing. 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.830
 dream of get cake 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.640
 Sorry, but I'll eat you. 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.210
 that neither the bulls with the hands a kiss and 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.210
 until the next
