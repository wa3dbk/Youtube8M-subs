00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
culture and eating out and so I chose a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.190 
culture and eating out and so I chose a
lot<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.030> different<00:02:15.330> themes<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:15.900> actually

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.310 
painting by Ralph goings and this idea
of<00:02:21.980> consumptive<00:02:23.390> properties<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.600> also<00:02:25.110> not

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
of consumptive properties is also not

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.960 
of consumptive properties is also not
just<00:02:25.470> literal<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.340> I'm<00:02:26.489> showing<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
just literal as I'm showing with the

just literal as I'm showing with the
food<00:02:27.239> but<00:02:27.720> also<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.260> terms<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.590> cars<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.060> cars

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.949 
food but also in terms of cars and cars
both<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:31.640> America<00:02:32.640> loving<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> consume<00:02:33.510> luxury

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959

item<00:02:34.440> vehicles<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.640> also<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.060> idea<00:02:36.330> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
item vehicles but also the idea of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.759 
item vehicles but also the idea of
consumption<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.200> time<00:02:37.380> when<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.739> a

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
consumption at a time when there was a

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.320 
consumption at a time when there was a
gas<00:02:38.010> shortage<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> mean<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.209> an

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
gas shortage so I mean that's an

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.560 
gas shortage so I mean that's an
underlying<00:02:39.870> idea<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> finally<00:02:41.570> American

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
underlying idea and finally American

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.350 
underlying idea and finally American
Life<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:43.500> charts<00:02:44.070> mostly<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.820> suburban

American<00:02:45.840> experience<00:02:46.470> leisure<00:02:47.010> time<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
portraiture because a lot of artists

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.009

in western painting you know it's a lot
of<00:03:40.180> tradition<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.900> goes<00:03:41.019> way<00:03:41.290> back

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
Roman for mosaics you know in Pompeii

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.990 
Roman for mosaics you know in Pompeii

where they did bits of food you know
that<00:03:55.239> sort<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.569> looked<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.049> been

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
that sort of looked like it's been

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.020 
that sort of looked like it's been
spilled<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.680> floor<00:03:56.829> but<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.609> all<00:03:57.790> part

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
spilled on the floor but it's all part

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.449 
spilled on the floor but it's all part
of<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:59.099> picture<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.680> know<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.099> terms<00:04:03.129> of

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
of the picture and you know in terms of

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.819 
of the picture and you know in terms of
modern<00:04:03.790> painting<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.870> know<00:04:05.019> really<00:04:05.680> goes

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
modern painting it you know really goes

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.059 
modern painting it you know really goes
back<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.280> Dutch<00:04:06.579> pictures<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.659> the<00:04:08.560> 17th

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
back to the Dutch pictures of the 17th

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.089 
back to the Dutch pictures of the 17th
century<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.419> not<00:04:10.629> that<00:04:10.750> I'm<00:04:11.099> thinking

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
century so it's not that I'm thinking

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.490 
century so it's not that I'm thinking
about<00:04:12.400> those<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.419> know<00:04:13.510> when<00:04:13.659> I'm<00:04:13.780> painting

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
about those you know when I'm painting

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.219 
about those you know when I'm painting
but<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.040> sort<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.609> see<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.539> as<00:04:16.599> part<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:17.079> the

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
but I sort of see that as part of the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:27.629 
but I sort of see that as part of the
continuum<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.099> I'm<00:04:18.669> working<00:04:18.880> in

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.709 

I<00:04:27.729> think<00:04:28.659> the<00:04:28.840> end<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.319> the<00:04:30.120> 1970s<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.569> I

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719 
I think the end of the 1970s and I

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.350 
I think the end of the 1970s and I
started<00:04:34.719> these<00:04:34.930> paintings<00:04:35.469> of<00:04:35.789> store<00:04:36.789> windows

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
started these paintings of store windows

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.399 
started these paintings of store windows
with<00:04:37.749> mannequins<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.029> the<00:04:40.029> idea<00:04:40.449> being<00:04:40.779> to

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
with mannequins and the idea being to

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.860 
with mannequins and the idea being to
contrast<00:04:42.779> artificial<00:04:44.219> people<00:04:45.219> with<00:04:45.460> real

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
contrast artificial people with real

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.499 
contrast artificial people with real
Street<00:04:46.870> sees<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.560> real<00:04:47.770> people's<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.879> kind

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
Street sees and real people's is a kind

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.279 
Street sees and real people's is a kind
of<00:04:49.629> interaction<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:52.090> two<00:04:52.139> elements<00:04:53.139> and

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
of interaction of the two elements and

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.219 
of interaction of the two elements and
the<00:04:55.229> interestingly<00:04:57.419> this<00:04:58.419> figure<00:04:59.020> is

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
the interestingly this figure is

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.839 
the interestingly this figure is
actually<00:04:59.650> a<00:05:00.360> friend<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.539> mine<00:05:01.719> who<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.080> a
