that he's had very good success with
already<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.240> thought<00:00:18.570> smartlipo<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.980> something

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
already I thought smartlipo is something

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759 
already I thought smartlipo is something
that<00:00:20.460> I'd<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.060> try<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:22.260> having<00:00:22.289> done

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
that I'd like to try not having done

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
that I'd like to try not having done
anything<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.369> before<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.119> forget<00:00:24.449> let's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
anything like this before I forget let's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.290 
anything like this before I forget let's
give<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.990> shot<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.519> looks<00:00:27.210> like

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
give this a shot but that we looks like

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.150 
give this a shot but that we looks like
there's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.660> more<00:00:27.720> pros<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.650> smartlipo

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
there's a lot more pros of the smartlipo

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.790 
there's a lot more pros of the smartlipo
and<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.480> used<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.080> done<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.590> lot

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and then way it used to be done a lot

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
and then way it used to be done a lot
less<00:00:31.980> recovering<00:00:32.730> less<00:00:32.940> scarring<00:00:33.420> better

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
less recovering less scarring better

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
less recovering less scarring better
results<00:00:34.530> yeah<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.880> looking

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
results yeah that's what I'm looking

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
results yeah that's what I'm looking
forward<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> seeing<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.590> fact<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
forward to seeing if that is in fact the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
forward to seeing if that is in fact the
case<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.430> sure<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> after

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
case on I'm sure it will be but after

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
case on I'm sure it will be but after
learning<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.160> supposed<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> whole

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
learning that is supposed to be a whole

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
learning that is supposed to be a whole
lot<00:00:42.300> easier<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> body<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.770> more

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
lot easier on the body and more

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.610 
lot easier on the body and more
effective<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> long<00:00:45.090> run<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.289> thought

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
effective in the long run it's I thought

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.619 
effective in the long run it's I thought
well<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.100> time<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> give<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> shot<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
well it's time you give it a shot and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.709 
well it's time you give it a shot and
what<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> hoping<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.800> result<00:00:50.250> wise

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
what are you hoping for like result wise

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
what are you hoping for like result wise
well<00:00:51.719> less<00:00:52.110> hanging<00:00:53.039> over<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> beard

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
well less hanging over the the beard

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
well less hanging over the the beard
belly<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.199> s<00:00:55.500> hanging<00:00:55.890> over<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
belly if you will s hanging over the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.450 
belly if you will s hanging over the
belt<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.210> ability<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.899> fit<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
belt the ability to fit into all the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
belt the ability to fit into all the
pants<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> already<00:01:00.300> gone<00:01:00.600> rather<00:01:01.020> than

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
pants that I already gone rather than

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
pants that I already gone rather than
buying<00:01:01.530> movements<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.660> most

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
buying movements I think will be most

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
buying movements I think will be most
effective<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.549> give<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> most

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
effective and will give me the most

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
effective and will give me the most
pleasure<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> point<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.740> today<00:01:07.860> what
