00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.220 

alright<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.820> let's<00:00:15.000> get<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> transformation

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
alright so let's get the transformation

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.050 
alright so let's get the transformation
when<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.590> macro<00:00:16.980> mode<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.760> may<00:00:17.880> look

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
when I have macro mode on so it may look

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.850 
when I have macro mode on so it may look
out<00:00:18.360> of<00:00:18.480> focus<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> moment<00:00:19.500> there

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
out of focus for just a moment there

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.670 
out of focus for just a moment there
until<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.310> close<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:20.820> lens<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
until I get close to the lens if you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
until I get close to the lens if you
have<00:00:22.860> previous<00:00:23.310> garland<00:00:23.730> releases

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
have previous garland releases

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.240 
have previous garland releases
transformation<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.080> exactly<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> same

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
transformation is exactly the same

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.269 
transformation is exactly the same
because<00:00:26.669> it<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.270> other<00:00:27.689> than<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.320> change<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
because it is other than the change of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
because it is other than the change of
materials<00:00:29.989> exactly<00:00:30.989> the<00:00:31.050> same<00:00:31.259> as<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
materials exactly the same as the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
materials exactly the same as the
previous<00:00:31.590> release<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.570> waves<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.840> on

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
previous release so the waves are on

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
previous release so the waves are on
swing<00:00:34.290> bars<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.970> there<00:00:35.970> are<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> couple<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
swing bars here there are a couple of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.660 
swing bars here there are a couple of
magnets<00:00:37.070> right<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> course

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
magnets right there and then of course

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
magnets right there and then of course
magnets<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> legs<00:00:42.500> really<00:00:43.500> strong<00:00:43.800> ones

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
magnets and the legs really strong ones

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.329 
magnets and the legs really strong ones
too<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:45.000> hold<00:00:45.379> nicely<00:00:46.379> so

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
too so these really hold nicely so

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.750 
too so these really hold nicely so
basically<00:00:47.760> we're<00:00:48.089> just<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.489> take<00:00:50.489> those

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
basically we're just going to take those

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.739 
basically we're just going to take those
out<00:00:53.179> one<00:00:54.179> of<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.749> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.230> see

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
out one of these up so you can see

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:06.430 
out one of these up so you can see
whilst<00:00:57.749> I<00:01:01.129> snaps<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.539> feet

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.710 

also<00:01:07.440> click<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.210> first

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
also click out when I first got my first

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
also click out when I first got my first
Garlin<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.350> took<00:01:10.560> me<00:01:10.710> till<00:01:11.460> Josh<00:01:11.729> B's<00:01:11.970> review

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
Garlin it took me till Josh B's review

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
Garlin it took me till Josh B's review
to<00:01:12.450> realize<00:01:12.810> those<00:01:13.050> actually<00:01:13.380> popped<00:01:13.620> out

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to realize those actually popped out

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
to realize those actually popped out
like<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.420> open<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> feet<00:01:16.970> let<00:01:17.970> me<00:01:18.090> repeat

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
like that open up the feet let me repeat

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.060 
like that open up the feet let me repeat
the<00:01:18.780> same<00:01:19.020> process<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.710> other<00:01:19.860> side

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 

nice<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.940> tight<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> clicking<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
nice and tight and clicking as you can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.100 
nice and tight and clicking as you can
hear<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.120> basically<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.780> kind<00:01:31.080> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
hear and then basically it just kind of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
hear and then basically it just kind of
straightened<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.830> our<00:01:31.950> legs<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.030> should

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
straightened out the our legs I should

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.070 
straightened out the our legs I should
say<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.930> lift

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
say and then and then I'm going to lift

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.359 
say and then and then I'm going to lift
the<00:01:40.260> seat<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.540> basically<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the seat up and basically this can be a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.200 
the seat up and basically this can be a
little<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.150> hook<00:01:45.420> under<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:47.210> we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
little little hook under here and we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
little little hook under here and we
want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> make<00:01:48.600> sure<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> clear<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.430> gas

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
want to make sure that clear the gas

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.590 
want to make sure that clear the gas
tank<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:52.800> just<00:01:53.040> rolls<00:01:53.580> right<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:55.220> now

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
tank and that just rolls right down now

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320 
tank and that just rolls right down now
let<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.630> try<00:01:57.990> shows<00:01:58.380> two<00:01:58.680> wheel<00:01:59.520> does<00:01:59.789> roll<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
let me try shows two wheel does roll and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.090 
let me try shows two wheel does roll and
there<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> hole<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.830> my<00:02:01.920> thumb

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
there is a hole right there and my thumb

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.980 
there is a hole right there and my thumb
is<00:02:02.390> lines<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.660> peg<00:02:06.660> right

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
is lines up right there and peg right

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.820 
is lines up right there and peg right
there<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.890> right<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:09.410> next<00:02:10.410> though<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
there just go right in next though you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.729 
there just go right in next though you
get<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.070> both<00:02:11.400> sides<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.959> try<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.410> stand<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
get up both sides and try and stand it

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.810 
get up both sides and try and stand it
up<00:02:13.800> straight<00:02:14.100> because<00:02:14.220> you'll<00:02:14.400> actually<00:02:14.550> need

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
up straight because you'll actually need

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.250 
up straight because you'll actually need
the<00:02:14.970> legs<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.330> balance<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.870> rest<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.140> this

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the legs to balance for the rest of this

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
the legs to balance for the rest of this
process<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.910> from<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.209> going<00:02:21.239> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
process and from there you're going to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.190 
process and from there you're going to
get<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> seat<00:02:22.530> em<00:02:23.450> there's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.630> little<00:02:24.810> door

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
get the seat em there's a little door

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.390 
get the seat em there's a little door
here<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:27.500> back<00:02:28.500> side<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.980> may<00:02:29.100> want<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
here on the back side you may want to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.449 
here on the back side you may want to
give<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> little<00:02:30.090> space<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.780> can

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
give that a little space so that can

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.810 
give that a little space so that can
kind<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.610> clear<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.310> doesn't<00:02:35.549> want<00:02:35.760> to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
kind of clear and this doesn't want to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.100 
kind of clear and this doesn't want to
play<00:02:35.970> along<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.570> course<00:02:38.630> there<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.780> go<00:02:39.900> just

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
play along of course there we go just

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
play along of course there we go just
kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> snap<00:02:40.680> some<00:02:40.980> sequins<00:02:41.700> shogo<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
kind of snap some sequins shogo can and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.350 
kind of snap some sequins shogo can and
theory<00:02:43.709> sit<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.579> while<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.820> transform

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
theory sit in there while you transform

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940 
theory sit in there while you transform
it<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.049> be<00:02:46.170> honest<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.590> gets<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.829> little

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it but to be honest it gets a little

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.370 
it but to be honest it gets a little
difficult<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.730> we're<00:02:48.660> not<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.230> doing

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
difficult so we're not going to be doing

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.420 
difficult so we're not going to be doing
that<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.750> now<00:02:51.750> here's<00:02:52.410> where<00:02:52.620> most<00:02:52.829> folks<00:02:53.160> for

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that and now here's where most folks for

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.590 
that and now here's where most folks for
having<00:02:53.730> problems<00:02:55.579> with<00:02:56.579> their<00:02:57.209> Garland's

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
having problems with their Garland's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.900 
having problems with their Garland's
arms<00:03:00.600> come<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:02.070> magnets<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:02.790> on

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
arms come out a little magnets here on

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.069 
arms come out a little magnets here on
the<00:03:03.030> end<00:03:03.150> I'll<00:03:03.360> give<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> better<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:03.959> at

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
the end I'll give you a better look at

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.560 
the end I'll give you a better look at
those<00:03:04.760> once<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.209> point<00:03:06.420> with

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
those once we get to that point with

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.000 
those once we get to that point with
your<00:03:06.720> information<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:07.890> you're<00:03:07.950> going

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
your information from here you're going

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.800 
your information from here you're going
to<00:03:08.130> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.640> support<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.299> fuselage

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
to kind of have to support the fuselage

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.580 
to kind of have to support the fuselage
it's<00:03:10.799> not<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.430> finicky<00:03:12.120> as<00:03:12.329> it<00:03:12.600> kind<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.350> looks

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it's not as finicky as it kind of looks

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220 
it's not as finicky as it kind of looks
on<00:03:13.829> camera<00:03:13.860> here<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.930> we're<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.110> open

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
on camera here so we're going to open

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.840 
on camera here so we're going to open
these<00:03:16.470> up<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.739> bit<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.549> i<00:03:17.579> would<00:03:17.790> do

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
these up a little bit what i would do

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.490 
these up a little bit what i would do
want<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> point<00:03:18.299> out<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.540> there<00:03:18.930> are<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.350> is

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
want to point out is there are this is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.289 
want to point out is there are this is
where<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.799> started<00:03:20.130> breaking<00:03:20.519> on<00:03:20.640> folks<00:03:20.970> in

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
where it started breaking on folks in

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.539 
where it started breaking on folks in
here<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.140> aware<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.010> got<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.430> be

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
here so be aware of it you got to be

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.120 
here so be aware of it you got to be
aware<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.940> there<00:03:24.090> are<00:03:24.120> two<00:03:24.540> hinges<00:03:25.380> one

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
aware that there are two hinges one

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.430 
aware that there are two hinges one
closest<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.880> wheel<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.230> shoulder

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
closest to the wheel one in the shoulder

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.220 
closest to the wheel one in the shoulder
so<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.459> suggest<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:30.030> bringing<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.959> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so what I suggest is bringing that up to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.289 
so what I suggest is bringing that up to
a<00:03:31.260> clicks<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:32.549> making<00:03:32.970> sure<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
a clicks and then just making sure the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.680 
a clicks and then just making sure the
arms<00:03:33.600> cleared<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.410> have

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
arms cleared so you have

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.640 
arms cleared so you have
room<00:03:34.990> they're<00:03:36.600> being<00:03:37.600> aware<00:03:37.840> i<00:03:38.050> tend<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.410> grab

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
room they're being aware i tend to grab

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.680 
room they're being aware i tend to grab
right<00:03:38.950> here<00:03:39.250> at<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.550> circle<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.270> just<00:03:40.510> to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
right here at the circle and just to

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.380 
right here at the circle and just to
make<00:03:40.720> sure<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.230> clicks<00:03:41.820> again<00:03:42.820> getting<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.300> out

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
make sure it clicks again getting it out

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.470 
make sure it clicks again getting it out
of<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.600> way<00:03:44.400> these<00:03:45.400> are<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.730> diecast<00:03:46.120> parts

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
of the way these are the diecast parts

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.600 
of the way these are the diecast parts
in<00:03:46.630> here<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.420> little<00:03:49.930> weird<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.650> takes

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
in here this is a little weird and takes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.300 
in here this is a little weird and takes
a<00:03:51.820> couple<00:03:52.030> times<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.690> practice<00:03:53.140> before<00:03:53.320> it's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
a couple times of practice before it's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.740 
a couple times of practice before it's
real<00:03:54.730> obvious<00:03:54.910> what<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.390> do<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.600> but

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
real obvious what you do it but

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.990 
real obvious what you do it but
basically<00:03:56.080> there<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:56.890> you're<00:03:57.640> going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.820> be

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
basically there is you're going to be

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.750 
basically there is you're going to be
able<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.450> kind<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.140> pull<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.620> wheel<00:03:59.800> away<00:04:00.370> just

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
able to kind of pull the wheel away just

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.430 
able to kind of pull the wheel away just
a<00:04:00.880> little<00:04:01.120> bit<00:04:01.210> not<00:04:01.450> hard<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:02.050> don't<00:04:02.200> want<00:04:02.380> to

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
a little bit not hard you don't want to

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.890 
a little bit not hard you don't want to
break<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:03.070> is<00:04:03.280> plastic<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.000> here<00:04:04.270> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
break this this is plastic in here and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.770 
break this this is plastic in here and
it<00:04:05.020> just<00:04:05.050> rolls<00:04:05.530> like<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.450> basically<00:04:07.450> going

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
it just rolls like that basically going

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.930 
it just rolls like that basically going
to<00:04:07.870> bring<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.170> arm<00:04:08.350> in<00:04:08.530> like<00:04:08.710> that<00:04:08.920> I'm<00:04:09.790> going

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
to bring the arm in like that I'm going

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.150 
to bring the arm in like that I'm going
to<00:04:10.030> put<00:04:10.210> that<00:04:10.390> over<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:10.660> out<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.050> way<00:04:11.200> so

shoulders from being floppy and not

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.200 
shoulders from being floppy and not
connected<00:04:49.620> here's<00:04:50.620> what<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.890> want<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.160> do<00:04:51.310> did

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
can see it that is double hinged so you

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.610 
can see it that is double hinged so you
want<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.169> make<00:04:59.200> sure<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.770> that<00:04:59.800> kind<00:05:00.250> of

want to make sure that that kind of
it'll<00:05:02.620> kind<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.919> naturally<00:05:03.280> do<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.520> it's<00:05:03.640> kind

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
it'll kind of naturally do it it's kind

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.290 
it'll kind of naturally do it it's kind
of<00:05:03.910> at<00:05:04.030> an<00:05:04.120> angle<00:05:04.590> where<00:05:05.820> see<00:05:06.820> where<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.150> kind

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
of at an angle where see where it kind

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.210 
of at an angle where see where it kind
of<00:05:07.419> indents<00:05:07.810> is<00:05:08.140> going<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.440> rest<00:05:08.740> right<00:05:08.980> under

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
of indents is going to rest right under

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.610 
of indents is going to rest right under
the<00:05:09.310> fuselage<00:05:09.960> just<00:05:10.960> make<00:05:11.110> sure<00:05:11.140> all<00:05:11.320> thats

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
the fuselage just make sure all thats

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.060 
the fuselage just make sure all thats
lined<00:05:11.860> up<00:05:12.070> close<00:05:12.550> your<00:05:12.820> hatch<00:05:13.860> then<00:05:14.860> pretty

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
lined up close your hatch then pretty

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.730 
lined up close your hatch then pretty
much<00:05:15.160> that's<00:05:15.580> it

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.710 

push<00:05:19.740> got<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.160> cockpit<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.390> little

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
push got the cockpit this is a little

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.000 
push got the cockpit this is a little
tight<00:05:22.880> but<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.030> does<00:05:24.180> go<00:05:24.360> in<00:05:24.540> now<00:05:24.870> back<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.980> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
tight but it does go in now back to the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.460 
tight but it does go in now back to the
arms<00:05:26.430> here<00:05:26.660> this<00:05:27.660> point<00:05:27.930> things<00:05:28.170> are<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.320> little

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
arms here this point things are a little

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.790 
arms here this point things are a little
floppy<00:05:28.800> what<00:05:29.730> happens<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:31.260> want<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.620> be

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
floppy what happens is you want to be

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.170 
floppy what happens is you want to be
able<00:05:31.950> to<00:05:32.220> kind<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.520> straighten<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.030> out<00:05:33.120> a

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
able to kind of straighten it out a

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.720 
able to kind of straighten it out a
little<00:05:33.390> bit<00:05:33.570> can<00:05:33.810> get<00:05:33.960> those<00:05:34.170> in<00:05:34.500> there<00:05:34.800> and

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
little bit can get those in there and

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.820 
little bit can get those in there and
that<00:05:36.000> will<00:05:36.270> now<00:05:36.450> set<00:05:36.840> tightly<00:05:37.500> against<00:05:37.740> the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
that will now set tightly against the

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.650 
that will now set tightly against the
body<00:05:38.070> without<00:05:38.400> too<00:05:38.730> much<00:05:38.880> flop<00:05:39.210> want<00:05:39.480> to<00:05:39.540> make

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
body without too much flop want to make

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.720 
body without too much flop want to make
sure<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.230> wheel<00:05:40.410> actually<00:05:40.920> rolls<00:05:41.280> all

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
sure that the wheel actually rolls all

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.410 
sure that the wheel actually rolls all
the<00:05:41.760> way<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.150> kind<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.420> clicks<00:05:43.460> by<00:05:44.460> natural

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
the way and kind of clicks by natural

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.320 
the way and kind of clicks by natural
it'll<00:05:45.810> kind<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.140> want<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.380> sit<00:05:46.650> there<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.970> it

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
it'll kind of want to sit there and it

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.910 
it'll kind of want to sit there and it
does<00:05:48.600> roll<00:05:48.870> back<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.140> little<00:05:49.350> bit<00:05:49.500> once<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:49.800> do

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
does roll back a little bit once you do

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.280 
does roll back a little bit once you do
that<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.340> kind<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.580> clicks<00:05:50.850> into<00:05:51.030> place<00:05:51.290> and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
that it kind of clicks into place and

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.540 
that it kind of clicks into place and
you<00:05:52.350> don't<00:05:52.500> have<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.710> worry<00:05:52.860> about<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:54.470> floppy

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
you don't have to worry about a floppy

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.129 
you don't have to worry about a floppy
arms<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.180> speak

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.420 

alright<00:06:04.139> so<00:06:04.410> basically<00:06:04.560> all<00:06:04.889> we<00:06:04.979> got<00:06:05.100> left<00:06:05.130> to

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
alright so basically all we got left to

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.390 
alright so basically all we got left to
do<00:06:05.669> are<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.720> arm<00:06:06.900> pieces<00:06:07.260> so<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.860> want<00:06:08.130> to<00:06:08.280> get

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
do are the arm pieces so I want to get

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.360 
do are the arm pieces so I want to get
this<00:06:08.639> in<00:06:08.880> close<00:06:09.180> here<00:06:09.419> for<00:06:09.720> you<00:06:10.370> basically

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
this in close here for you basically

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.770 
this in close here for you basically
these<00:06:11.550> magnets<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.210> we're<00:06:12.419> holding<00:06:12.690> it

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
these magnets that we're holding it

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.969 
these magnets that we're holding it
through<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.020> chance<00:06:13.260> you<00:06:13.470> just<00:06:13.650> snap<00:06:13.949> right

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
through the chance you just snap right

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.350 
through the chance you just snap right
back<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.729> these<00:06:15.690> little<00:06:16.080> doors<00:06:16.350> open<00:06:16.740> here<00:06:17.360> and

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
back in these little doors open here and

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.140 
back in these little doors open here and
if<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:18.510> rotate<00:06:19.110> here<00:06:19.470> now<00:06:20.400> these<00:06:20.669> can<00:06:21.000> get

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
if you rotate here now these can get

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.210 
if you rotate here now these can get
stuck<00:06:21.510> sometimes<00:06:21.780> don't<00:06:22.260> fight<00:06:22.560> I<00:06:22.770> find<00:06:23.040> it's

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
stuck sometimes don't fight I find it's

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.040 
stuck sometimes don't fight I find it's
easier<00:06:23.370> to<00:06:23.729> do<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.960> smaller<00:06:25.410> door<00:06:26.870> before<00:06:27.870> you

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
easier to do the smaller door before you

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.390 
easier to do the smaller door before you
close<00:06:28.290> the<00:06:28.440> magnet<00:06:28.800> all<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.040> way<00:06:29.160> in

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.620 

basically<00:06:32.400> open<00:06:32.760> those<00:06:32.880> up<00:06:32.910> and<00:06:33.360> there's<00:06:33.570> a

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
basically open those up and there's a

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.680 
basically open those up and there's a
hand<00:06:33.960> in<00:06:34.169> there<00:06:34.380> just<00:06:34.530> go<00:06:34.740> roll<00:06:35.100> out<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:36.479> doors

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
hand in there just go roll out the doors

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.290 
hand in there just go roll out the doors
closed<00:06:37.020> back<00:06:37.320> up<00:06:38.120> little<00:06:39.120> knobs<00:06:39.780> in<00:06:40.080> there

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
closed back up little knobs in there

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.750 
closed back up little knobs in there
lock<00:06:42.300> it<00:06:42.539> in<00:06:42.750> and<00:06:45.110> individually<00:06:46.760> articulated

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
lock it in and individually articulated

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.730 
lock it in and individually articulated

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
fingers my earlier garland the finger

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.950 
fingers my earlier garland the finger
seem<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.130> get<00:06:53.250> loose<00:06:53.490> pretty<00:06:53.850> quickly<00:06:54.150> this

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
seem to get loose pretty quickly this

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.580 
seem to get loose pretty quickly this
has<00:06:55.410> seemed<00:06:55.740> to<00:06:55.860> have<00:06:55.949> hold<00:06:56.310> its<00:06:56.789> tightness

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
has seemed to have hold its tightness

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.990 
has seemed to have hold its tightness
again<00:06:58.590> I<00:06:58.740> suspect<00:06:59.190> they<00:06:59.340> might<00:06:59.520> be<00:06:59.639> using<00:06:59.820> a

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
again I suspect they might be using a

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.230 
again I suspect they might be using a
different<00:07:00.360> quality<00:07:01.699> plastic<00:07:02.699> than<00:07:02.910> they<00:07:03.060> used

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
different quality plastic than they used

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.330 
different quality plastic than they used
to<00:07:03.419> so<00:07:03.840> again<00:07:04.850> noticeable<00:07:06.169> noticeable

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
to so again noticeable noticeable

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.960 
to so again noticeable noticeable
quality<00:07:08.340> control<00:07:08.460> improvements<00:07:10.250> not<00:07:11.250> that<00:07:11.460> DF

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
quality control improvements not that DF

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.029 
quality control improvements not that DF
first<00:07:12.240> release<00:07:12.539> was<00:07:12.570> horrible<00:07:13.169> you<00:07:13.950> know

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
again you know sometimes these things

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.180 
again you know sometimes these things
happen<00:07:17.150> especially<00:07:18.150> with<00:07:18.599> the<00:07:19.190> complex

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
happen especially with the complex

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.219 
happen especially with the complex
engineer<00:07:20.669> toy<00:07:20.849> so<00:07:21.150> we<00:07:21.240> get<00:07:21.450> just<00:07:21.840> going<00:07:21.990> to<00:07:22.080> pop

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
engineer toy so we get just going to pop

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
so you can see the door that door rotate

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:40.999 
so you can see the door that door rotate
the<00:07:32.930> hand<00:07:33.169> out<00:07:33.669> nope

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.700 

and<00:07:41.309> this<00:07:42.089> is<00:07:42.539> of<00:07:42.749> course<00:07:42.809> more<00:07:43.259> on<00:07:43.379> the<00:07:43.499> shape

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:43.710 
and this is of course more on the shape

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.279 
and this is of course more on the shape
of<00:07:43.889> a<00:07:44.009> fist<00:07:44.900> so<00:07:45.900> that<00:07:46.139> you<00:07:46.650> can<00:07:46.860> hold<00:07:47.069> the<00:07:47.189> gun
