00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay this is my Electrolux super J now
I'm<00:00:07.799> really<00:00:08.189> not<00:00:08.370> too<00:00:08.639> familiar<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
I'm really not too familiar with the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.740 
I'm really not too familiar with the
Electrolux<00:00:10.290> model<00:00:11.190> names<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.940> anything<00:00:12.480> like

Electrolux model names or anything like

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
Electrolux model names or anything like
that<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:14.299> know<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.809> over<00:00:16.080> there<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
that I know that one over there is the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.910 
that I know that one over there is the
golden<00:00:17.070> jubilee<00:00:19.130> but<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.350> believe<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
golden jubilee but this one I believe is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.439 
golden jubilee but this one I believe is
either<00:00:23.100> super<00:00:23.550> J<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.269> Silverado<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:26.449> something

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
either super J or Silverado or something

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:41.479 
either super J or Silverado or something
like<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:35.149> model<00:00:36.149> 1505<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> one

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like that it is model 1505 and this one

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.880 
like that it is model 1505 and this one
is<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.180> design<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.410> pretty<00:00:43.680> much

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is actually in design it's pretty much

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.970 
is actually in design it's pretty much
identical<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.289> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
identical to that one over there but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
identical to that one over there but
it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.700> newer<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.239> has<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it's a little bit newer it has a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.260 
it's a little bit newer it has a
slightly<00:00:48.780> stronger<00:00:49.200> motor<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> 10<00:00:51.030> amp

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
slightly stronger motor this is 10 amp

motor<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> nine<00:00:53.489> point<00:00:53.760> seven

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
motor that one has a nine point seven

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
motor that one has a nine point seven
amp<00:00:54.360> motor<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:57.649> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> dinged<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.280> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
amp motor it's kind of dinged up it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
amp motor it's kind of dinged up it's
been<00:00:59.969> well<00:01:00.239> used<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:02.930> see<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.140> dented<00:01:05.040> on

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
been well used and see it's dented on

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
been well used and see it's dented on
the<00:01:05.460> bottom<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> little<00:01:06.000> bit<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.560> only

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the bottom a little bit there the only

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
the bottom a little bit there the only
thing<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.100> I've<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.490> done<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thing that I've actually done with this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
thing that I've actually done with this
one<00:01:09.750> other<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.140> wipe<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> off<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.180> replace

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
one other than wipe it off is replace

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
one other than wipe it off is replace
the<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.600> wheel<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the little wheel on it because this is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.679 
the little wheel on it because this is
the<00:01:14.850> wheel<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.880> quite

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the wheel that was on it it's not quite

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.280 
the wheel that was on it it's not quite
round<00:01:19.530> anymore<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.330> sure<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.840> happened

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
round anymore I'm not sure what happened

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
round anymore I'm not sure what happened
to<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.860> why<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to that or why it's like that because it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.160 
to that or why it's like that because it
turns<00:01:24.479> fine<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.880> who<00:01:26.880> knows<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
turns fine so who knows but this is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.039 
turns fine so who knows but this is
actually<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> wheel<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.670> old

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
actually the wheel off of an old

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.200 
actually the wheel off of an old
dehumidifier<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.070> fit<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> works<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
dehumidifier but it fit in it works so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
dehumidifier but it fit in it works so
but<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> don't<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.210> any

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:13.770 
lights dim a little bit when I turn it
on

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.760 

okay<00:03:14.780> for<00:03:15.050> some<00:03:15.230> reason<00:03:15.620> it's<00:03:15.770> not<00:03:15.860> sucking

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
okay for some reason it's not sucking

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.510 
okay for some reason it's not sucking
there's<00:03:18.770> no<00:03:18.950> air<00:03:19.160> coming<00:03:19.970> up<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.950> think

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
there's no air coming up so I think

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.860 
there's no air coming up so I think
there<00:03:22.730> might<00:03:22.850> be<00:03:22.910> something<00:03:23.240> stuck<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
there might be something stuck in the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990 
there might be something stuck in the
hose<00:03:24.020> okay<00:03:24.770> now<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.730> taken

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.720 
hose okay now that we have that taken
care<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.410> with<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.950> help<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.340> my<00:03:28.550> shop<00:03:28.880> vac<00:03:29.240> and

old power cord I got whatever was stuck
in<00:03:35.930> hose<00:03:36.580> out<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:39.280> now<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.940> should<00:03:41.150> be<00:03:41.270> able<00:03:41.510> to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280

piles<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.140> fuzz<00:03:45.470> too<00:03:47.080> because<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:49.270> machine

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
piles of fuzz too because this machine

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.240 
piles of fuzz too because this machine
was<00:03:50.480> not<00:03:50.630> designed<00:03:51.110> as<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.410> suction<00:03:51.769> only

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
was not designed as a suction only

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.040 
was not designed as a suction only
machine<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:55.090> there's<00:03:56.090> probably<00:03:56.570> no<00:03:56.810> reason

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
machine so I there's probably no reason

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.890 
machine so I there's probably no reason
to<00:03:57.440> try<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.640> make<00:03:59.050> it<00:04:01.150> suck<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.390> stuff

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
to try it to make it suck up that stuff

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:19.900 
to try it to make it suck up that stuff
but<00:04:03.290> whatever<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> let's<00:04:05.540> give<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.840> shot<00:04:05.870> now
