00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.599
 alfonso of the yummy blog titled 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.429
 Eat well daily and the conxo is a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.960
 'crack' making empanadas so I'm going to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 versionar one of his good 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 basically what I'm going to cover is your 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.830
 mass if you want to make one of your recipes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 step by step you just have to go to your 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 good blog what edited very fast because 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.349
 we made an eternal video but let's go 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 to it the first thing that we are going to do is 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.579
 roast the peppers and for that we are going 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.070
 to spread olive oil and put them 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.920
 in the oven that is about 200 degrees and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.930
 we leave it between 15 and 20 minutes later 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 we remove it and cover it until it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 cool before peeling it on the other hand 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.739
 we chop some onions and put them on 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.719
 podar salted and we also add 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.670
 chopped garlic 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 we have to cook the eggs and or 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 I put in the cold water and when it breaks 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.309
 boil it I leave it about ten minutes you can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.309
 make the empanada of what you want from 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.980
 sausage loin cod tuna and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.140
 I'm going to make it from txistorra so I'm going to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.659
 chop the before adding the onion 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 that as you can see, it's already good 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 and I told you, we removed the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 peppers and we cover them so that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.140
 later it is easier to paste them for another 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 side we grate the tomato we fry it 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 adding a couple of tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.479
 and a couple of tablespoons of paprika and what 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.219
 we are suffering without stopping to remove 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.950
 we are testing and when it is at its point 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.049
 we add the pepper that we have peeled and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.179
 chopped and hard-boiled eggs that also 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.829
 we have chopped them and we have the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.740
 filling that we are going to drain 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.659
 taking advantage of the oil because then what 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 let's incorporate the mass that we do 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.009
 with flour baker's yeast 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.909
 dissolved in a little water a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.950
 pinch of salt 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.110
 I'm going to tune it up a bit with a little 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 of tarragon we are stirring e 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 we incorporate water if it is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.020
 necessary until we have a mass 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.869
 homogeneous and we knead for about 10 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.189
 minutes until it is very flexible and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.219
 it does not stick to hands 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.899
 we reincorporamos the well floured bowl the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.909
 cover with a damp cloth and the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.099
 we leave until it doubles its size in 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.109
 that moment we make two pieces one for 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.420
 the base a little bigger and one for the 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.970
 we extend it, we put it in a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 Oven container we incorporate 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 Fill distribute it well 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.480
 we cover with the part of the mass that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 we have reserved we mix an egg 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.430
 beaten with a splash of milk and the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
 put together so that it is well golden and not 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 burn out we finally put it in the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.850
 oven that is preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 and we 're going to leave it with the fire down 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.200
 about 45 minutes yes on the part of 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.300
 up is not golden at the end 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.460
 you just put fire up and what 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.080
 you put on until you take color and 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.520
 this is already good I hope you have 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.520
 liked a hug until then
