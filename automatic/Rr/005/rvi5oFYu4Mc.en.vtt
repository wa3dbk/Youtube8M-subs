00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 a particular cut of meat the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.550
 beef lancet is a very flesh 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 lean and gelatinous that we will cook without 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 fats added with red wine with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.039
 vegetables so let's see how to prepare 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.260

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.930
 vegetable nut spoon inter ha 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 a face at home or salt and a little 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.980
 of pepper aromatic herbs to taste as 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.020
 for example sage rosemary and garlic 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.390
 then guys this is a piece of 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.750
 meat protagonist of our recipe 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 the cheek of sending a piece of meat 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 very thin as I said before gelatinous 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.400
 and also rather inexpensive is not a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 however, the usual piece of meat is common 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 you book at the butcher my butcher of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 trust in dad then we say that not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.040
 I have these problems and I'm already taken 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.370
 ahead I crushed the carrot and I have it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.980
 diced 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.570
 and I caught the filaments two liras gnosi 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.960
 from the celery I am also cut from the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.300
 the recipe in extraordinarily yes there 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.430
 here we prepare a perfect where 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.250
 we arrange all the aromas that is 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:36.670
 garlic we can remove the garlic 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.530
 then a few leaves of sage this 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.580
 we will need it to prevent analysts 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.240
 turn off for the nests and also some 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.700
 rosemary 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.460
 if you like you can also add a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.400
 onion I didn't see it well you know 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 that I don't like even with laurel 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.850
 we grow very well we make a little bundle 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.650
 cooking is cold or all 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.990
 ingredients that we will put inside 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.540
 there will be no rupture of priests 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.960
 preliminary as you see I do not put 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 don't even fat the concetta because not the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.930
 rho but because I don't want it to form 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.610
 crunchy crust 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 I want the whole house to be very 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.450
 strong and that's how the mandate collapsed 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 let's put a braised libertine in my own way 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 we do so then I did not put salt 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.250
 because I want to use my dice 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.870
 vegetable in cream now as you have 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.580
 understood the use very often because of me 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.040
 like to recommend it right from 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.350
 realizing extraordinary if at home 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.310
 you don't want to do anyway 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.560
 replace it with the usual we hear one 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.670
 little more for our nice with the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.400
 spices and then a glass about 200 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 milliliters of red wine 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.110
 take good red wine ok people 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.050
 it's practically done now we don't have to 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.730
 do nothing but put the lid on 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.620
 bring to a boil when it starts 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.670
 the finished boiling immediately we maintain 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.250
 one calls lively beautiful 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.590
 then when it reaches the stamp we keep 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.320
 a very low flame and we do 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.270
 boil very very slowly from meat 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.480
 for about an hour and a half two until when 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.070
 it will be soft inside very well 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.290
 guys like my cheeks 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.570
 pad on the position therefore we cover 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.090
 a lid we lower we import 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.070
 cooking I advise you to look at it often 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.080
 always during turnaround cooking 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.360
 very slowly so as not to break the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.310
 meat eventually we add some 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.530
 water wants some red wine 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.630
 if we see that it immediately dries too much 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.850
 Then we see the final result 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.430
 I cooked very very gently 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.380
 labuan city soon I can 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.610
 see in the meantime also prepared the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.260
 puree that one is second according to 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.700
 this type of meat 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.440
 now quantity that attention is not 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.450
 start with pork cheek 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.110
 has absolutely nothing to do with the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 cheek liguria and we put it on a 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.250
 we pay then pay 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.250
 meanwhile we find all the sauce 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.730
 this is ours immediately for one side 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.210
 naturally I removed the lager called of 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.550
 roma we move on the basket 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.980
 I've already started cutting some pawns 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.620
 the white part you see when there 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.030
 meat is still raw it is not fat but it is 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 the piece of lace you can also 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.480
 don't talk here you see the veins 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.070
 absolutely to make a nice cut there 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.710
 I advise you to leave a little in 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.760
 india to say the meat or to cool 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.540
 even better we make slices 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.330
 complaint back this is my idea is 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.250
 of presentation of the cheek in 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.170
 alternative to pure you can serve it with 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.030
 of the soft soft policy of the 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.350
 end of the world really the one proposed 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.520
 for Easter, however, you can clearly 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.520
 adapt it to all occasions
