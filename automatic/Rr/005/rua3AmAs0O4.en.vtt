00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.070 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
customize<00:00:06.330> your<00:00:06.690> notification<00:00:07.620> area<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.610> that

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
customize your notification area so that

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.540 
customize your notification area so that
persistent<00:00:10.080> notifications<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.010> don't

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
persistent notifications like this don't

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.060 
persistent notifications like this don't
continue<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.480> happen<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.440> obviously<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:14.009> you

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
continue to happen so obviously when you

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
continue to happen so obviously when you
connect<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> Wi-Fi<00:00:14.700> that's<00:00:15.000> always<00:00:15.299> going

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
connect to the Wi-Fi that's always going

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
connect to the Wi-Fi that's always going
to<00:00:15.690> be<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:16.080> until<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.949> disconnect<00:00:17.490> from

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to be there until you disconnect from

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
to be there until you disconnect from
the<00:00:17.730> Wi-Fi<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.960> you're<00:00:19.140> trying<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> take<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the Wi-Fi and if you're trying to take a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
the Wi-Fi and if you're trying to take a
screenshot<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.730> want<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
screenshot or you just want this to be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259 
screenshot or you just want this to be
cleaner<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.779> clearer<00:00:22.910> there's<00:00:23.910> no<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
cleaner and clearer there's no way to

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.370 
cleaner and clearer there's no way to
really<00:00:24.510> disable<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.750> module

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
really disable that now with the module

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
really disable that now with the module
that<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.800> show<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.580> can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that I'm going to show you you can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
that I'm going to show you you can
actually<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.210> remove<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:31.050> whole<00:00:31.859> bunch<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
actually just remove a whole bunch of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually just remove a whole bunch of
things<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.380> notification<00:00:34.380> area<00:00:34.680> all

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
things from the notification area all

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
things from the notification area all
from<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.180> place<00:00:36.210> which<00:00:36.600> makes<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> super

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
from one place which makes it super

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
from one place which makes it super
convenient<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.399> want<00:00:38.610> Wi-Fi<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
convenient so if you don't want Wi-Fi to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
convenient so if you don't want Wi-Fi to
show<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:41.040> ongoing

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
show or if you don't want your ongoing

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
show or if you don't want your ongoing
application<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.210> particular<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.200> smart

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
application in particular this one smart

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
application in particular this one smart
app<00:00:43.829> protector<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:45.120> show<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:45.899> though

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
app protector to show here even though

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
app protector to show here even though
you<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.440> running<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you know it's running you can just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
you know it's running you can just
disable<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.039> an

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
disable that so it's going to be an

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
disable that so it's going to be an
exposed<00:00:50.610> module<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> obviously<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
exposed module and obviously for that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
exposed module and obviously for that
we're<00:00:52.860> gonna<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.460> rooted<00:00:53.879> phone<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.449> the

notify clean now once that's checked off

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.050 
notify clean now once that's checked off
we<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> framework<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.979> reboot<00:01:35.790> now

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we can go to framework and reboot now

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.870 
we can go to framework and reboot now
once<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.750> rebooted<00:01:37.280> once<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.400> rebooted

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
once we rebooted once we rebooted

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
once we rebooted once we rebooted
obviously<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> app<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.170> installed

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
obviously the app will now be installed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
obviously the app will now be installed
and<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.340> head<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.490> into<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.180> app<00:01:42.299> it's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and we can head over into the app it's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
and we can head over into the app it's
all<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> clean<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.640> launch

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
all right here now if I clean you launch

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.190 
all right here now if I clean you launch
it<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.270> it'll<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> here

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
now here are all the applications where

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
now here are all the applications where
we<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> obviously<00:01:49.680> adjust<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.220> red<00:01:50.399> ones<00:01:50.610> or

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
because I disable them using the module

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.369
