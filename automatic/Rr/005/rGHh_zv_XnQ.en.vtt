00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.720
 not the first time I read comments about 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.940
 tom how cool to be an owner bye 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 after a year or two on this platform 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.259
 4k era begins 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 and on the console wto nothing like that will happen 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.750
 and we for now will play games without 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.760
 ladder 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.300
 so this talk amuses me 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.609
 even decided to make a separate opinion right away 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 the question here is who are you dreaming about 4k what are you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 play gathered in resolution or 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 still provoke games mean 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 race formats and then you will 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 lament the heartless graphics 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 and you both bought the monitor already suitable and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 do not forget that the diagonal should be 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 big to make the difference tangible 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.910
 you have a good zheka they need a monitor 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.350
 in fact, now the right options are worth 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 three and a half thousand dollars 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.460
 cheaper of course but not straight tomorrow yet 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 should warn you know how u 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 god on ipad looks strung out 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.940
 iphone apps so here is a high 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 resolution will require ultra textures 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 which weighs will be respectively plus 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.260
 cool videos like you download games 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 30 gigabytes each 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 taking into account the video about whales generally keep quiet 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 4k remixes your internet channel simply 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 crack with the movies in principle the situation 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.490
 blue-ray quality that is interesting to many 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.100
 I do not like because of excessive clarity and you 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 4k wait i repeat i need you 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.939
 there will be a big diagonal and better 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 projectors free wall three meters 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 tall try in a small window 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.509
 youtube and see 725 then 1080 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 practice finding differences 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.320
 users will be especially happy 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 VKontakte which is not against viewing 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 inch screens 4k this shit of course 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 will be especially clear further we are so 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 We look at compressed full hd 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.850
 not on compressed 4k movies weigh a terabyte and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.619
 of course you have to squeeze even 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.020
 there will be a blue-ray of a hundred and fifty gigs of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.939
 streaming 4k games will also be problems with 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.979
 current formats are not going smoothly 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.939
 if the issue is bandwidth 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.619
 global network 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.420
 you do not like when the weekend 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.220
 Internet speed drops because everything 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.049
 watch full hd clips on youtube something 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.329
 download imagine the same 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.729
 situation only on a global scale in 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.350
 how many times there 4k cooler in the same 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.090
 will increase the load on the network of games 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.490
 Of course, lucky if you believe the author 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.259
 forte thing of the past and therefore the ladder 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.000
 many are kicking new consoles since 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.400
 there actually have problems with games 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.180
 in 4k and so I decided to stake out 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.829
 place your steam engines 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.540
 but you know what potentially leads 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.250
 success steam machines accelerated 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.290
 cantilever cycle considering all 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.120
 the above I do not see that benefit from 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 A new format that would justify everything 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.739
 those costs that will have to go 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.480
 at least there is no need to hurry and in any 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.280
 case personally i'm going to play games 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.200
 they are in permission I can say for sure 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.840
 what the battlefield on new consoles and pc 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.790
 played equally interesting despite 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.299
 do not believe the difference in permissions see 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.439
 my story from stockholm on this topic 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.790
 progress is good stuff but not 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.159
 forget rationality 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.590
 why 4k is needed by manufacturers, I understand 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.819
 why do you need him do n't you think many of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.209
 you yourself do not really know 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.409
 Fallujah ideas were necessary because 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.599
 480pi on large screens looked 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.370
 nauseous but here it is linear 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.680
 dependency greater resolution for 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.209
 larger screens like me so 4k 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.040
 more appropriate in cinema than at home 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.780
 home cinema exception with 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.489
 projector but it's still dear yes 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.620
 little with the situation more 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.419
 controversial but isn't it better to come up 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.310
 advanced smoothing algorithms like 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.569
 it has already been done once and not 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.400
 would hurt to spend more time 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.450
 quality games with existing ones 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.209
 technology 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.069
 never mind kinect and and krius reef word on 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.599
 the next five years we have something else 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.760
 work without 4k 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.889
 and so I have a powerful home 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 pc and i will play some games on it 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.329
 I do not understand people who are proud 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.340
 capacity of their cars Ponte and various 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.530
 complex alas lead only to the fact that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.919
 every year new smartphones come out and all 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.560
 scream 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.970
 oh how little difference help rob on 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.009
 This all do not forget about voting 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.629
 remind that we have a portal not 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.939
 youtube channel only or page 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.650
 VKontakte well wait your opinion in 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.849
 I just had my comments 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.849
 shared everything bye
