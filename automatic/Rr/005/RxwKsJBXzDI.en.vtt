00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.840
 More and more young German architects are working internationally here they are 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.190
 in our series the master builder is going today we want to clear the way 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 do 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 one of the so-called tiger states in Southeast Asia 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.579
 with a huge boom in recent decades 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.989
 Of all this little has remained 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.520
 the country he feels constantly new 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.620
 the ideal place for young creative architects 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 young team of BP and SEO Lehmann loud in Taichung, the second largest city 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.240
 Bavaria 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.820
 Here they have realized their first projects 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 the principle 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 the connection of tradition 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.530
 on the outskirts a new office building 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 for a medium-sized company 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.230
 the one protective wall stands between the historic restored courtyard house and 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 he spends behind it 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 Even the clients have deliberately chosen for an architect team 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 Germany decided 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 Germany is esteemed for that and the engineers under the eyes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.609
 stood the work 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.260
 he was wrong 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.320
 and percent 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560
 October protests 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.430
 and this was what the weapons actually wanted 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 one in June 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.120
 the connection between the individual buildings is falsified 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 and it also ensures short distances between the factory floor 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.720
 the new office wing 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 Con around the historic reception building 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.960
 a new residential area in Taichung 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.580
 The architects of BakBone have grown in the construction of these voters 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 especially close with the client 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.859
 Family plans wanted a modern house tailored to the climate 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.839
 but also a retreat 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.839
 from the hustle and bustle of any big Asian city 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.109
 DAPD-hes 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.039
 It can not be a drama but we would tension as a German office 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:41.069
 that is actually the different influences together the german 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.309
 that too 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.439
 the Taiwanese and so for example one of the modern materials 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.729
 and they are also from Germany 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.049
 such as the device for the technology 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.389
 the central space connects inside and outside and is different 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.730
 Layers visible The clou of Hosp hanging articulated spaces the optical 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.109
 connected and always provide new insights 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.349
 the apocalypse perpetrators seven locations in the house offer a variety of 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.729
 Buy prospects 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.469
 We like it a lot and also our friends are surprised nobody in one 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 House also offer paroli in this way 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.749
 the success and the quality from the outside meanwhile have become new ones 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.189
 Orders 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.189
 also for whom in Germany 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.049
 the success story of the architect 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.469
 It started here in Leipzig 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.659
 five years ago she won the competition for the conversion of the 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.549
 university 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.399
 Maik Lehmann 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.009
 both cultivation and co 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.829
 and Martin w 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.799
 a campus at the foot of a skyscraper in the middle of the city for such a young one 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.569
 Office a daunting task 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.759
 Ramon very strong 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.519
 existing structure and gave twice to get at the buildings 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.479
 at the property what is available but then just to the 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.869
 entire city's architectural context around it 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.129
 almost finished 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.439
 the new cafeteria 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.439
 also harmoniously harmonized with the building center 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.840
 the red army in which structure the facade 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 will also be the interior 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.719
 the two because Kohl opens the woman to the city 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.620
 Menzer is open 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.710
 the refectory is a devilish building Green therefore we wanted to build a subsoil 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.060
 to the city a nice balcony and where the students can eat or 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.289
 work 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.990
 for that the basic idea is to establish a relationship between ours 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.990
 Buildings and the beach of Sylt 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:49.860
 the architect 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.219
 only here is indeed an exciting connection happy 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.219
 between the campus students the noble ring built from Leipzig 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.800
 get the pons 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.169
 they build in Germany and Taiwan 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.479
 For such a young office in the end a balancing act would be the answer 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.970
 some of the works internationally is that 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.749
 both 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.599
 to have 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.879
 Percent taxable percent 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.300
 only limited 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.589
 Pauli's percent 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.589
 in which at St but we want it 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.979
 that has become normal 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 They have already opened a new office in Taiwan 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.819
 there are new orders here 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.569
 9 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.300
 in part already they are building a new villa 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.099
 Apartment and gallery at the same time for a successful art collector 8 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.040
 also lie in the capital Taipei Plan and Syria several 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.430
 Major projects 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.110
 including two museum buildings 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.819
 as on the string and Taiwan was worth it 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.959
 a business card for new orders worldwide
