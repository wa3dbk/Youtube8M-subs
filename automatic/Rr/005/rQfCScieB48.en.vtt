00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
it's kind of weird of course we are

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.080 
it's kind of weird of course we are
going<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.860> need<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.160> assault<00:02:56.489> rifle<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.650> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
movie he was using one that was black so

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.270 
movie he was using one that was black so
since<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.900> already<00:03:04.260> black<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.980> are

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
since this one is already black we are

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
since this one is already black we are
just<00:03:05.550> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.000> go<00:03:06.360> ahead<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.050> leave<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> black

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
I really don't think there's a need to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.540 
I really don't think there's a need to
paint<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.290> simple<00:03:10.590> thing<00:03:10.800> last

have<00:03:43.920> no<00:03:44.100> freakin<00:03:44.430> clue<00:03:44.459> maybe<00:03:44.880> it's<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.560> flare

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560

maybe<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.160> grenade<00:03:47.549> if<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.180> turn<00:03:48.360> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
maybe it's a grenade if you turn the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.910 
maybe it's a grenade if you turn the
backpack<00:03:48.959> over<00:03:49.260> there<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.530> these<00:03:49.650> little

spaces in here to actually hold the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.620 
spaces in here to actually hold the
thing<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.400> until<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.430> know<00:03:53.579> what<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.420> thing<00:03:54.600> is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
thing so until I know what this thing is

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.860 
thing so until I know what this thing is
for<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.850> go<00:03:56.970> ahead<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.540> stick<00:03:57.840> it
