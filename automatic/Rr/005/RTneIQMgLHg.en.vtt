role-playing game but they're mostly
known<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.940> think<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:44.450> for<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:45.050> game<00:00:45.140> units

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.900 
known I think now for this game units
and<00:00:45.710> masterminds<00:00:46.130> because<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.430> think<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:46.760> is

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
and masterminds because I think this is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.639 
and masterminds because I think this is
kind<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.149> like<00:00:47.329> they're<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.809> most<00:00:47.989> successful

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
kind of like they're the most successful

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.950 
kind of like they're the most successful
thing<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:48.980> they've<00:00:49.160> done<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:49.579> far<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.809> about

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
thing that they've done so far now about

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.229 
thing that they've done so far now about
the<00:00:51.079> game<00:00:51.260> itself<00:00:51.850> role-playing<00:00:52.850> games<00:00:53.090> are

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
the game itself role-playing games are

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.120 
the game itself role-playing games are
really<00:00:53.480> about<00:00:53.750> how<00:00:53.989> much<00:00:54.140> fun<00:00:54.350> they<00:00:54.530> are<00:00:54.559> how

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
really about how much fun they are how

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.610 
really about how much fun they are how
well<00:00:55.340> they<00:00:55.489> work<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.180> just<00:00:56.840> how<00:00:57.020> creative<00:00:57.380> you

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
well they work and just how creative you

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.770 
well they work and just how creative you
can<00:00:57.770> be<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.670> think<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.059> really<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
can be and I think that really the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.910 
can be and I think that really the
reason<00:01:00.079> why<00:01:00.110> I<00:01:00.200> like<00:01:00.410> mutants<00:01:00.829> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
reason why I like mutants and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.130 
reason why I like mutants and
masterminds<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.670> most<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.270> any<00:01:02.540> role-playing

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
something that just like was able to be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.099 
something that just like was able to be
a<00:01:37.099> bruiser<00:01:37.429> or<00:01:38.179> just<00:01:38.329> something<00:01:38.479> they<00:01:38.719> give

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
a bruiser or just something they give

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.529 
a bruiser or just something they give
you<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.259> lot<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.439> examples<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:40.279> kind<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.819> start

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
you a lot of examples to kind of start

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.120 
you a lot of examples to kind of start
off<00:01:41.719> on<00:01:41.959> the<00:01:42.139> power<00:01:42.349> point<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.889> then<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.099> can

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
off on the power point and then you can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.190 
off on the power point and then you can
kind<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.459> redistribute<00:01:44.179> them<00:01:44.419> cuz<00:01:45.079> otherwise

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
kind of redistribute them cuz otherwise

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.989 
kind of redistribute them cuz otherwise
you<00:01:45.799> know<00:01:45.919> you<00:01:46.249> you<00:01:46.459> wouldn't<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:46.880> know

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
you know you you wouldn't really know

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.789 
you know you you wouldn't really know
what<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.270> start<00:01:47.569> because<00:01:48.049> it's<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.319> point<00:01:48.590> based

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
what to start because it's a point based

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.769 
what to start because it's a point based
system<00:01:49.249> you<00:01:49.789> could<00:01:49.939> really<00:01:50.119> just<00:01:50.389> pump<00:01:50.689> all

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:50.779 
system you could really just pump all

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.359 
system you could really just pump all
your<00:01:50.899> points<00:01:51.229> into<00:01:51.439> things<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.829> won't<00:01:52.009> help

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
your points into things that won't help

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.159 
your points into things that won't help
you<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.609> combat<00:01:52.849> or<00:01:53.060> don't<00:01:53.479> make<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.779> kind<00:01:54.079> of

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.169 
you in combat or don't make you kind of

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:57.429 
you in combat or don't make you kind of
useful<00:01:54.590> or<00:01:54.740> even<00:01:54.799> fun<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:56.539> this<00:01:56.749> is<00:01:56.989> this<00:01:57.259> can

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
useful or even fun and this is this can

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.109 
useful or even fun and this is this can
be<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.709> big<00:01:57.950> greatest<00:01:58.340> strength<00:01:58.669> of<00:01:58.849> the<00:01:58.939> game

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
be the big greatest strength of the game

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.969 
be the big greatest strength of the game
but<00:01:59.749> it<00:01:59.840> can<00:01:59.959> also<00:02:00.079> be<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.349> game's<00:02:00.679> greatest

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
but it can also be the game's greatest

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.870 
but it can also be the game's greatest
weakness

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
weakness

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.159 
weakness
so<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.209> strongest<00:02:02.509> part<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.869> this<00:02:02.929> game<00:02:03.109> is

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
so the strongest part of this game is

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:05.649 
so the strongest part of this game is
the<00:02:03.439> character<00:02:03.889> creation<00:02:04.249> system<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.509> can

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
the character creation system you can

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.449 
the character creation system you can
really<00:02:05.899> create<00:02:06.139> any<00:02:06.409> kind<00:02:06.889> of<00:02:06.950> character<00:02:07.219> or

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
really create any kind of character or

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.150 
really create any kind of character or
superhero<00:02:08.210> you<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.600> imagine

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
superhero you can imagine

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.250 
superhero you can imagine
you<00:02:10.000> need<00:02:10.120> some<00:02:10.270> masterminds<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.870> based<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.230> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
you need some masterminds is based on a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.530 
you need some masterminds is based on a
d20<00:02:11.680> system<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.210> lot<00:02:13.390> of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
d20 system but there's a lot of

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.510 
d20 system but there's a lot of
differences<00:02:14.020> between<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:14.830> any<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
differences between this and any of the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.850 
differences between this and any of the
Dungeons<00:02:15.880> &amp;<00:02:16.000> Dragons<00:02:16.030> games<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.590> kind<00:02:17.830> of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons games and I kind of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.980 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons games and I kind of
go<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.130> why<00:02:18.430> first<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.240> foremost

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
go into why first and foremost

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.540 
go into why first and foremost
mutants<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.440> masterminds<00:02:20.920> does<00:02:21.160> not<00:02:21.310> have

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
mutants and masterminds does not have

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.180 
mutants and masterminds does not have
character<00:02:21.970> classes<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:23.710> this<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.010> can

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
character classes with this you can

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.220 
character classes with this you can
customize<00:02:24.670> your<00:02:24.850> character<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.510> point

if<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.260> wanted<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> create<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> character<00:02:36.220> that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
if you wanted to create a character that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.780 
if you wanted to create a character that
could<00:02:37.060> shoot<00:02:37.360> lasers<00:02:37.930> out<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.260> his<00:02:38.410> eyes<00:02:38.790> fly

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
could shoot lasers out of his eyes fly

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.420 
could shoot lasers out of his eyes fly
and<00:02:40.360> would<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:40.990> mechanical<00:02:41.650> body<00:02:41.830> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
and would have a mechanical body you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.830 
and would have a mechanical body you
could<00:02:42.580> totally<00:02:42.820> make<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.210> in<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.570> system

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
could totally make that in this system

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.150 
could totally make that in this system
and<00:02:44.140> that's<00:02:44.290> something<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.860> think<00:02:44.890> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
and that's something that I think is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.250 
and that's something that I think is
really<00:02:45.430> awesome<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.940> creative<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.870> another

really awesome and creative and another
thing<00:02:47.500> about<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.920> that's<00:02:48.100> different<00:02:48.490> from

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
thing about this that's different from

and they can stop time and fly around
and<00:03:44.709> teleport<00:03:45.130> everywhere<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:46.000> can<00:03:46.150> it's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
and teleport everywhere you can it's

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.300 
and teleport everywhere you can it's
really<00:03:46.840> awesome<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.590> respect<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
really awesome in that respect that you

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.070 
really awesome in that respect that you
make<00:03:48.670> characters<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.780> kind<00:03:49.989> of

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
make characters that can do that kind of

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.500 
make characters that can do that kind of
stuff<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:50.920> it's<00:03:51.550> really<00:03:51.790> problematic<00:03:52.090> for

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
stuff but it's really problematic for

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.870 
stuff but it's really problematic for
Dungeon<00:03:53.230> Master's<00:03:53.590> or<00:03:53.770> game<00:03:53.980> masters<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.670> kind

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
Dungeon Master's or game masters to kind

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.330 
Dungeon Master's or game masters to kind
of<00:03:54.940> keep<00:03:55.150> track<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.600> what's<00:03:55.780> going<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:56.680> if

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
of keep track of what's going on now if

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.470 
of keep track of what's going on now if
you're<00:03:57.459> thinking<00:03:57.790> about<00:03:57.880> running<00:03:58.209> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
you're thinking about running a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.810 
you're thinking about running a
superhero<00:03:59.110> campaign<00:03:59.680> I<00:04:00.100> think<00:04:00.670> that

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
superhero campaign I think that

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.729 
superhero campaign I think that
absolutely<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.750> should<00:04:02.080> get<00:04:02.260> mutants<00:04:02.590> and

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
absolutely you should get mutants and

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.010 
absolutely you should get mutants and
masterminds<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.610> is<00:04:03.760> by<00:04:03.910> far<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.239> best<00:04:04.600> we

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
masterminds this is by far the best we

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.530 
masterminds this is by far the best we
like<00:04:05.410> superhero<00:04:05.980> campaign<00:04:06.580> or<00:04:06.880> superhero

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
like superhero campaign or superhero

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.110 
like superhero campaign or superhero
system<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.410> think<00:04:09.010> that's<00:04:09.160> out<00:04:09.310> there<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.880> don't

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
system I think that's out there I don't

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.780 
system I think that's out there I don't
think<00:04:10.300> there's<00:04:10.540> really<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.870> good<00:04:11.110> alternative

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
think there's really a good alternative

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.050 
think there's really a good alternative
there<00:04:12.790> are<00:04:12.910> some<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.690> know<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:14.110> gurps<00:04:14.800> or<00:04:15.250> or

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
there are some you know like gurps or or

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.690 
there are some you know like gurps or or
some<00:04:16.299> other<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:17.080> think<00:04:17.710> palladium<00:04:18.220> made<00:04:18.460> one

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
some other I think palladium made one

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.090 
some other I think palladium made one
and<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.330> know<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.479> didn't<00:04:19.840> really<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.229> now

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
and you know I didn't really like it now

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.219 
and you know I didn't really like it now
combat<00:04:21.580> aside<00:04:22.030> mutants<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.450> masterminds<00:04:23.020> can

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
characters based on this system it can

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.960

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
totally work it's kind of nice because

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.870 
totally work it's kind of nice because
it's<00:06:04.270> not<00:06:04.510> based<00:06:04.840> on<00:06:05.020> hit<00:06:05.229> points<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.220> if<00:06:06.669> you

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
have greater repercussions because in

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.860 
have greater repercussions because in
other<00:06:12.070> systems<00:06:12.400> if<00:06:13.000> you're<00:06:13.419> really<00:06:13.630> high

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870
