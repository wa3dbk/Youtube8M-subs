00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.790
 this tested its from importer long in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.520
 slice of lexus 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.050
 around here is the lexus nx what 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.550
 is going to add this car to it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 existing offer 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 alex there was no car in it yet 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.730
 compact SUV segment and that is clear 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.920
 showed a growth throughout Europe 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 and actually on global and then from 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.230
 texas important to this car 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.969
 develop 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 but to what extent does this distinguish me and me 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.430
 from the audi q5 the bmw x3 it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 the traditional the traditional brands 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 just grab it for example 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.989
 design is powerful it is pronounced 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 very elegant at the same time 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 in addition, a hybrid 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.480
 has powerful hybrid powertrain 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 interesting later 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 take innovations in batches on board 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 for example the wireless charging of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 your phone and the chassis is very bad 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.829
 refined is a very beautiful 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 balanced chassis 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 great seating position and I love it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.250
 convinced that you will have a lot of driving pleasure 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.409
 to get to this car 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.400
 you already called it that is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.320
 of course very beautiful but it is too 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 immediately the only powertrain for this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 car is that not immediately the weakness we 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 I did not even prefer diesel 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 this segment 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 we know from experience that people are whole 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.909
 be very enthusiastic about the hybrid 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.009
 powertrain eh that we make and have 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 we now also recently seen with wol ts 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.939
 it also gets a very nice car whole 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 good reviews not only from the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.210
 press but also from consumers 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.100
 just very nice 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 relax driving and don't forget 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 that you also get this automatically with 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.979
 a vending machine 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 climate control and cruise control that we 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.939
 add so much to a car 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.140
 that is very relaxed and very nice 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.520
 driving 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 okay those are in between it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 competitive 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 pricing you also have the price 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 investigated downwards 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.909
 it is really a very good offer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.320
 how should we see that exemption 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 we are completely at the bottom of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.149
 the market 45 1990 euros 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.149
 there is no competition for this car 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.009
 offers no in this segment with so much 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.640
 standard on the car he thinks of the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.039
 cruise control 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 think and climate control also think one 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.550
 for example, pick up and delivery service 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.010
 and think of the vending machine that we do 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.970
 have standard in the old in this car 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 197 horsepower that's going to surpass someone 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.950
 so if you are looking for a car in this segment 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.629
 but just have it on your shirt is okay 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.370
 finally what do you expect 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.550
 of this because I don't assume you guys 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.379
 the pretension have the decent q5 and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.640
 x3 to stick to the crown but you 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.450
 wants to get a bit close 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
 yet 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 yes absolutely we want absolutely in the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.090
 come close you are absolutely right 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.319
 of course we are cheek side too 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.480
 realistic 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.209
 so we are trying 100 150 cars this year 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.670
 to sell and then want years there 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.200
 sell around 500 cars 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.819
 the car arrives in October at the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.330
 market so we know this year one more 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.730
 market 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 relatively limited but good at 20% 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.390
 addition, we think we are a lot 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.230
 interesting and competitive proposal 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.230
 have for the consumer
