00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
fatter at the other you want that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
fatter at the other you want that
tapered<00:01:36.299> point<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
tapered point so you kind of want it to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830 
tapered point so you kind of want it to
graduate<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.369> small<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.659> up

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
graduate from a small and all the way up

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.090 
graduate from a small and all the way up
to<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> thicker<00:01:40.380> end<00:01:40.560> kinda<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.979> an

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to a thicker end kinda like an

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.569 
to a thicker end kinda like an
elephant's<00:01:41.549> trunk<00:01:41.659> cut<00:01:42.659> even<00:01:43.290> pieces<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
elephant's trunk cut even pieces off and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
elephant's trunk cut even pieces off and
because<00:01:44.880> we've<00:01:45.030> graded<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.930> thickness<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
because we've graded the thickness of it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.289 
because we've graded the thickness of it
you're<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> end<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.909> six

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you're going to end up with six

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
you're going to end up with six
different<00:01:48.570> thicknesses<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.500> six<00:01:50.040> different

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
different thicknesses so six different

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
different thicknesses so six different
amounts<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.030> colored<00:01:51.390> dough<00:01:51.600> take<00:01:52.350> a

color<00:01:53.909> paste<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.479> rather<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:54.869> liquid

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
color paste here rather than liquid

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.380

rectangle<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.230> gonna<00:02:16.319> be<00:02:16.470> rolling

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
rectangle because we're gonna be rolling

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.619

it out into like a long rectangle piece
this<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.470> helps<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> start<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.550> roll<00:02:20.790> and
