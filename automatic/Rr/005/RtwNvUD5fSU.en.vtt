00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 the truth 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.480
 many times we do not dare to use 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.700
 garments with prints for fear of 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.350
 wrong to combine the garments 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.389
 more fun prints for me are 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.660
 the pants and they are very easy 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.660
 to combine let's see these four options 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.289
 there are endless prints to use in the 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.449
 pants I think this is one of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.119
 the most difficult to combine is the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.439
 camouflage or military print me 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 love these pants that are 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 Completely tube if your body is ideal 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.449
 for another type of cut is perfect no 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.059
 nothing happens can be cut boot 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.920
 flared or straight I simply decided 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.440
 that this tonality was well in play with 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 a pastel yellow top I love 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 make it cut to the waist and then 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.379
 flared because it is ideal for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 people with straight body I'm using 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.400
 very cute and flirty sandals 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.619
 they have some glimmers out there and that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.239
 camel color also matches with the 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.330
 other colors present in this look 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.060
 I'm using as an accessory a ring is 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.070
 pretty big we see an insect these 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.229
 insects in general see you in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 necklaces in bracelets and rings look 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 incredible I'm finally using a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 Large bag also matches with the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780
 sandals and that skull print does 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.640
 that transforms into something a little more 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.350
 rocker you have to balance a bit 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.549
 our looks and I find study 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.549
 'to use during the afternoon 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.579
 Y 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.909
 another purpose that sometimes we also find 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.280
 very difficult to combine is the tribal 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.560
 I'm wearing some pants with this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.229
 stamped the tonality that I chose is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.899
 ideal to use in fall winter are from 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.189
 corduroy there are many textures obviously 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.140
 you can find cuts and 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.630
 different textures 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 I wanted to combine it with a jeans shirt 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.039
 it's basic plus it never fails no matter 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.049
 the tonality I wanted this that is a 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.049
 medium term you can use something 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.420
 darker or lighter shoes with 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.729
 tip and bicolor finish because no 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.550
 we can have fun with any type 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.709
 of shoes could wear tennis sandals 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.430
 that does not matter to me I like to do this 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.930
 contrast I'm wearing three bracelets go 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.620
 in play also with the colors of 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.930
 trousers 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.700
 I really like this style of bracelets 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.530
 because we can combine them in very many 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.620
 different looks and my account is given to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.480
 nobody and finally a bag was the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.980
 sixties or also ideal to use 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.780
 during the afternoon we could even 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.190
 take them out during the night although I 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.190
 I prefer this look to go eat 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.219
 another 30 in pants that never fail 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.230
 The animal print also looks amazing 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.109
 in autumn-winter I'm using some 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.879
 very thin pants is silk type 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.709
 we can use them very casually 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.959
 but today I want to teach them how to combine 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.450
 the ones a little more formal are 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.459
 stopped completely straight and the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.709
 termination is with a spring so 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.719
 I wanted to hide that spring with a maxi 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.969
 soft black ether we could combine it with 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.950
 black or with white that is the combination 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.930
 perfect I chose black because I want 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.639
 wearing this look at night is a 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.290
 very simple sweater if they are fixed does not have 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.120
 prints or anything because we are already using 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.010
 paint on the bottom as 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.709
 simple is always to use the high part 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.720
 list and the lower part complete the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.340
 shoes are also finished in 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.319
 tip as you may realize me 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.269
 they love these have something of 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.129
 applications and brightness there are many 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.579
 different styles could also use 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.159
 closed tennis shoes flat type up 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.959
 sandals can look very nice with 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.780
 this look I'm wearing a necklace 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.540
 long has a few touches of green 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.650
 to add an extra color is long what 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.560
 that will make my trunk look 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.989
 much more stylized can use from 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.340
 so beautiful necklaces or these that 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.530
 They are also discreet and they look very 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.890
 elegant I'm finally using a 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.690
 bag has brightness is very flirtatious ideal 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.690
 to make you look during the night 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.920
 and we need a beach look so 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.230
 I chose this pants very funny 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.349
 has many prints present too 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.810
 different bright colors ideal for 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.959
 use in spring-summer time when 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.419
 it's a lot of sun I like to combine this 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.250
 type of print with the color black or with 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.260
 the white color I wanted the black color 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.710
 because I found this one that opted 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.460
 Very discreet straps loose and smooth 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.860
 I'm completely wearing high shoes 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.389
 they have the heel completely run what 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.580
 which makes them ideal up to 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.080
 to walk in the sand they could use 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.270
 also sandals with this look is 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.460
 would look very nice I'm using a 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.760
 belt just to put some 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.830
 extra little touches are very thin this 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.930
 type of belts are ideal for 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.610
 look with these looks if they were more 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.160
 thick it would look different so I 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.460
 I always advise you to use delgadito 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.990
 They look very clean I'm wearing bracelets 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.600
 they are different shades also be 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.039
 present the neon color we have it that 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.720
 play with other colors we can 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.760
 have fun with many colors more than 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.510
 combine very well and finally this 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.180
 bag that matches with the belt 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.220
 I like the camel color also present 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.550
 It's an extra touch to enjoy in 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.550
 summer 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.310
 now if there is no excuse to go out to the 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.600
 street wear those patterned pants that 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.490

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.110
