00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.510
 that's how you have to clean your 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:11.270
 screen with these instruments 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.290
 a bottle of water if you want him 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.290
 you throw soap inside 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:25.050
 a towel with which he cleaned estruch 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 your windshield 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.760
 and clean your screen 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.269
 these can be the clean boiler 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 You need to spend a lot of money on 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.550
 other things 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.720
 simply and simply 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.140
 throw this on the screens which I 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.140
 already did 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.900
 this 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.309
 although this one is a bit old but it 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.980
 consigned I remove the stains that 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.980
 they were on the screen on a plasma tv 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.390
 and that's all and right now I'm going to put 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.420
 a cover 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.960
 I have a 2-year-old boy and he broke a 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.150
 50-inch large plasma this is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.190
 another one that I have in another room and this is 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.460
 I want to protect and I will put a 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.220
 protective shield that calls 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.520
 but this protective script I invented it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.300
 I managed them by screen protector that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.880
 they say 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:44.680
 worth as 199 for 46 screens 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.060
 50 inches then it is 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.060
 I think only 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.490
 can in rose and get 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.170
 acrylic plastic acrylic dixit 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.270
 Clear 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 more clarito this jumps very thick 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.580
 I already put you of these things so that you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.700
 stick 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.800
 to television 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.800
 in all the corners like this 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 Yes my son 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.250
 He throws like a trolley car 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.860
 heavy throws them to the screen in 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.870
 times or do other things like that metal 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.540
 they weigh and they hit the hard screen 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.180
 and bankruptcy because the television that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.270
 had before he threw a plaque 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.710
 metal iron and it broke the screen 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.510
 one is the small track 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:49.470
 with that little gulch that made him 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 it went black and then the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.050
 screen and it got good black 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.620
 and put and lose my screen and to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.920
 buy one 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 it's too expensive or to repair it 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.400
 it comes out like buying a new one then 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 I invented this 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.180
 well in the next part I will show you 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.910
 he does not know how to do it 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.180
 with this you can clean the fluff that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180
 is 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.880
 it's clear 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.020
 as you can see here I put it 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.020
 and the little ones 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.769
 and there is the protector script protector 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.769
 just a little scrub here in front 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.769
 because it has a little bit of fluff 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.129
 clarita 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:11.590
 and there it is 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.590
 but let's see how the image looks 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.960
 very well 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.910
 something that is good there are reasons from before 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.910
 Angel 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.189
 A) Yes 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.189
 but 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:14.169
 protects from the blows of children of 23 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.169
 years that throw you resources 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.180
 I did this because a child of two years and 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.180
 they had the giant screen
