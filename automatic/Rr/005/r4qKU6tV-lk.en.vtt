00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 so my friends welcome back to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 the announced special video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.570
 you can already see from the video title of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 that is it today in the new I have 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.509
 you 're already 12 weeks on 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.820
 Weekend promised now you get 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.770
 really this weekend finally 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.170
 black on white or white 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 on yellow I was good to see that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 yes, the first thing I did was 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 now first set to normal because 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 time plays a very important role 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 roll when I see you right 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 you should also get enough of both 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.989
 I think ten of them 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 piece should be sufficient I still have 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 four other balls 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.140
 my balls and my table yes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 So it is then he has today 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.309
 I get gold kaspar is what's going on 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 but he does not work 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 to do a lot for this match 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 for this check is actually 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 in klitzschen player so it is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.989
 actually it should not be possible 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 but it is possible 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.410
 due to various problems in this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.510
 generation 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.980
 We already know other problems 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.539
 like missing you for example but that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.500
 is something completely different than me too 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.409
 explain something different someday 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.720
 Anyway, it would really have to be for the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.890
 ju glitsch note that this is not something 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.390
 is what you do only in the room 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 you can do the new kids 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.250
 also really expensive if your console 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 original play on your gameboy 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 do 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 you just have to do what I to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.119
 opened it up again and important 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 is that you have two coaches 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.570
 On the one hand, there is one thing that is extremely important 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.079
 different trainers of the kind like now 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.540
 this egghead route which is good 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.260
 that I have that lower right again 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.840
 from tonia 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.920
 Gude 8 and his head this player 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.470
 she believes and what she is here now 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.790
 Just note with him is her 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.720
 he is now outside the screensaver 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.820
 if we take a step up now 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.910
 he will go see us us one 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.640
 Demand Now is our goal 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.670
 We go one steps and quickly 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.130
 Immediately before the guy and looks at the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.590
 take the start button so that it is you 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.740
 menu the menu auftitt I'll show you that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.820
 times to hammer in an ok sell 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.800
 the type has not confirmed us now 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.190
 seen and you should be a pokémon with 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.570
 teleporter or flying with the best 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 because flying usually works 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.600
 Schaeffler is also about teleporter 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.920
 Of course, but I should have that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.740
 with which you now fly in front of the guy 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.380
 can we fly and do now 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.600
 Now fly to your city 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.730
 that is very important and you see that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.090
 fight us where she goes or or 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.350
 Ice hockey music and the way and now 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.390
 we fly after deduction are the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.280
 baunacher to her you see inatura 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.520
 There is now a coach of the city 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.000
 very important when we are in july her 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.280
 have to and you can do the glitch with 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 lightning every other pokémon against 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.459
 each other can all footprints 101 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.660
 you will be caught with this trick 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.080
 you just have to try luck 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.430
 try different trainers and then 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.730
 will you see it coming every time 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.140
 different audience but also the same 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.570
 again, something more in this game 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.519
 Coach here is extremely important is that 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.140
 you do not speak directly to tal 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.360
 want to address page or similar 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.760
 you should have the greatest possible distance 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.310
 the largest possible bend around it 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.890
 make and then only to this point 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.900
 a fight demand that namely a 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.510
 trainer of something because of msn 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.280
 blablabla party my dad off us dollar 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.080
 and he has a spot nobly noble 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.690
 level 17 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.010
 he also fits really cold 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.010
 to the really cute 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.950
 and yes mend more two us-researchers 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.260
 paderborn is we are leaving now though 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.629
 first slots and the rope is 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 broken okay that 's playing but now 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.310
 really totally did not matter because 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.099
 if we can have done that now 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.469
 nothing to stop us anymore 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.930
 for the youtube or the new tricks 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:12.930
 Calling you want to fly now 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.349
 very carefully read about labbadia and w2 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 Now you are waiting now, wait and see 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.639
 we leave the route via links and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.300
 the menu on top of it 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.710
 the menu just pop up and tricycle what 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.840
 if I do not happen now that we do not 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.000
 shut down 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:35.540
 Of course a fight dog will be with her 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.920
 should remember by 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.550
 you really right on your console 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.620
 that means there's no such thing 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.520
 have put around that gives original 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.740
 so do not play 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.030
 and instead of the trainer with the 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.490
 stain and you can do any 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.770
 try other coaches and if 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.930
 you did that, if you did 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.320
 you did that then you can 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.430
 look further and see what 's on 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.770
 portfolio building there are, for example 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.150
 a trainer in the cisco expo in the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.070
 I rocket brothers if you like 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:15.090
 against the fight instead of the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.170
 teenagers with the level 17 p with 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.980
 the playboy level 17 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.630
 then, in fact, so you are there 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.940
 lava could get there for example 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.260
 Obviously, level 7 is always on 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.740
 level serve that is also something 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.419
 These dolls run out and that's a yes 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.850
 more or less legal way to news 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.600
 we get to see it's bio caught 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:38.910
 then what's new from her now bio 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.010
 many experts doubt that 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.580
 existence of this pokémon few 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:47.900
 people have seen it 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.900
 what do we call it we just call it

 my joy you will see it works 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.389
