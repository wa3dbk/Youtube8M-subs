now<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> ease<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.230> application<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
now the ease of application and the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.519 
now the ease of application and the
consistency<00:00:24.110> we're<00:00:25.110> good

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
consistency we're good

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.440 
consistency we're good
we're<00:00:26.130> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> take<00:00:26.489> a<00:00:26.520> screen<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.270> which

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
we're going to take a screen here which

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.159 
we're going to take a screen here which
is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> 110<00:00:28.110> mesh<00:00:28.470> I've<00:00:29.430> got<00:00:30.029> newsprint<00:00:30.540> down

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
is a 110 mesh I've got newsprint down

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.590 
is a 110 mesh I've got newsprint down
I<00:00:31.200> put<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.220> emulsion<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I put the emulsion down with the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.170 
I put the emulsion down with the
emulsion<00:00:33.960> layer<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.370> plastic<00:00:35.910> side

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
emulsion layer up and the plastic side

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
emulsion layer up and the plastic side
down<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.860> screen<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.460> on

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
down I'm going to put a screen down on

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
down I'm going to put a screen down on
top<00:00:38.880> of<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.580> with<00:00:41.580> water<00:00:43.070> give<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
top of this and with water give it a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.750 
top of this and with water give it a
spray<00:00:44.490> application<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.160> actually

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
spray application and the water actually

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.040 
spray application and the water actually
turns<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.300> film<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.560> soluble<00:00:50.190> emulsion

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
turns the film into a soluble emulsion

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:00.140 
turns the film into a soluble emulsion
to<00:00:52.050> coat<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.380> screen<00:00:58.700> once<00:00:59.700> you've<00:00:59.820> got<00:01:00.000> the

to coat the screen once you've got the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.219 
to coat the screen once you've got the
entire<00:01:00.270> coverage<00:01:00.900> here<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.950> squeegee

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
entire coverage here take a squeegee

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.429 
entire coverage here take a squeegee
pull<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.979> firm<00:01:05.489> pressure<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
pull it through with firm pressure to

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.310 
pull it through with firm pressure to
scrape<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> excess<00:01:08.370> water<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.659> stops<00:01:10.080> the
