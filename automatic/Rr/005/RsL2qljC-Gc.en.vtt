of<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.280> spikes<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> better<00:01:36.960> deal

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

it not only are you recycling but you're

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
it not only are you recycling but you're

thing I was actually waiting in line try

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
thing I was actually waiting in line try
some<00:01:49.350> clothes<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.310> saw<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
some clothes on and I saw it out of the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
some clothes on and I saw it out of the
corner<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.450> eye<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.930> knew<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
corner of my eye and I knew I really

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
corner of my eye and I knew I really
liked<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> color<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.939> just

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
liked it just because the color was just

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.770 
liked it just because the color was just
like<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> pop<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> scarf<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
like a pop and it's just this scarf and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
like a pop and it's just this scarf and
I<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.680> silk<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.189> doesn't<00:01:59.490> feel

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I don't think it's silk it doesn't feel

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
I don't think it's silk it doesn't feel
silky<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.070> super

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
silky but it's like this really super

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.740 
silky but it's like this really super
cool<00:02:02.640> orange<00:02:03.119> color<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.079> wanted

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
cool orange color and I really wanted

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.080 
cool orange color and I really wanted
the<00:02:04.870> ends<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.140> my<00:02:05.200> hair<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:06.220> color<00:02:06.580> but<00:02:07.060> most

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
the ends of my hair this color but most

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.660 
the ends of my hair this color but most
won't<00:02:07.480> let<00:02:07.780> me<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.470> was<00:02:08.649> only<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:09.009> 99

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
won't let me and this was only a 99

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.820 
won't let me and this was only a 99
cents<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.360> I've<00:02:10.509> been<00:02:10.630> looking<00:02:10.780> for<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> scarf

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
cents and I've been looking for a scarf

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.580 
cents and I've been looking for a scarf
to<00:02:12.070> make<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.250> turban<00:02:12.730> width<00:02:12.910> that's<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:14.320> one

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
to make a turban width that's just one

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.830 
to make a turban width that's just one
color<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.160> very<00:02:15.400> neutral<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.000> also<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.480> pop

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
color it's very neutral but also a pop

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.510 
color it's very neutral but also a pop
because<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> lot<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> scars<00:02:18.070> we<00:02:18.190> haven't

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
because a lot of the scars we haven't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.160 
because a lot of the scars we haven't
printed<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.540> don't<00:02:19.720> really<00:02:19.840> go<00:02:20.050> with

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
printed so they don't really go with

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.420 
printed so they don't really go with
everything<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.770> thought<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.190> was<00:02:21.400> a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
everything so I thought this was a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.550 
everything so I thought this was a
really<00:02:21.670> fun<00:02:21.760> color<00:02:22.240> for<00:02:22.390> summer<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.410> just

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
really fun color for summer and I just

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.290 
really fun color for summer and I just
think<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.010> good<00:02:24.100> contrast<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:25.090> my

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
think it's like a good contrast with my

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.060 
think it's like a good contrast with my
hair<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.350> last<00:02:26.530> thing<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.800> picked<00:02:26.980> about

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
hair so the last thing I picked about

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.890 
hair so the last thing I picked about
the<00:02:27.280> first<00:02:27.520> wheel<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.030> actually<00:02:28.180> something<00:02:28.600> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the first wheel is actually something I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.810 
the first wheel is actually something I
wouldn't<00:02:29.290> usually<00:02:29.680> go<00:02:29.860> for<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.430> since<00:02:30.670> it's

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
wouldn't usually go for but since it's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.690 
wouldn't usually go for but since it's
like<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.510> whole<00:02:31.720> spring<00:02:32.140> trend<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.950> decided<00:02:33.520> to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
like the whole spring trend I decided to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.540 
like the whole spring trend I decided to
try<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.420> fit<00:02:34.720> pretty<00:02:34.930> good<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:36.430> just

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
try it on it fit pretty good it's just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.479 
try it on it fit pretty good it's just
this<00:02:36.880> floral<00:02:37.390> pastel<00:02:38.110> button-down<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.040> I

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
this floral pastel button-down and I

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.979 
this floral pastel button-down and I
like<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.270> florals<00:02:40.600> are<00:02:40.780> really

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
like it because the florals are really

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.020 
like it because the florals are really
tight<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:42.310> season<00:02:42.489> it's<00:02:42.730> all<00:02:42.850> about

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
tight and this season it's all about

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.030 
tight and this season it's all about
like<00:02:43.180> big<00:02:43.420> bold<00:02:43.810> florals<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.709> like<00:02:44.860> this

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
like big bold florals and I like this

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.260 
like big bold florals and I like this
because<00:02:45.370> they're<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:45.880> bit<00:02:46.090> more

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
because they're just a little bit more

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.000 
because they're just a little bit more
subtle<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.290> would<00:02:47.410> probably<00:02:47.560> pair<00:02:47.860> this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
subtle and I would probably pair this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.830 
subtle and I would probably pair this
with<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.340> some<00:02:48.610> kind<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.120> mint<00:02:49.480> colored

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
with like some kind of like mint colored

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.350 
with like some kind of like mint colored
bottom<00:02:50.440> maybe<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.489> my<00:02:51.610> guest<00:02:51.880> students<00:02:52.270> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
bottom maybe like my guest students that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.030 
bottom maybe like my guest students that
I<00:02:52.420> wore<00:02:52.600> in<00:02:52.690> our<00:02:52.780> previous<00:02:53.020> video<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.860> just

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
I wore in our previous video but I just

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.199 
I wore in our previous video but I just
think<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.310> super<00:02:54.610> cute<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.060> was

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
think this is super cute and this was

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:03.800 
think this is super cute and this was
only<00:02:55.450> three<00:02:55.660> dollars

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.090 

so<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.930> last<00:03:05.080> thing<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.380> picked<00:03:05.440> up<00:03:05.680> was<00:03:05.890> at<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
so the last thing I picked up was at the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.470 
so the last thing I picked up was at the
second<00:03:06.460> goodwill<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.060> was<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.270> last

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
second goodwill and this was the last

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.990 
second goodwill and this was the last
thing<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.900> found<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.440> whole<00:03:08.590> morning<00:03:09.100> but<00:03:09.910> it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
thing I found the whole morning but it
