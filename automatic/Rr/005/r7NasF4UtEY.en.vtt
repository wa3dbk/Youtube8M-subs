00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:14.109
 all geekitaly friends are ricky 95 today new video tutorials are a bit of 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.940
 days that I am now trying out the new operating system as you can see 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.090
 windows 7 and I would say for now I was really satisfied I like it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.820
 very much also the fact that microsoft and ciste getting used to customization 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.949
 of our system 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.810
 ie for example 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.320
 changing themes here is this new feature introduced 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.989
 precisely with windows 7 that we also find 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.560
 for on the web 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.710
 official site but what I'm looking for on my windows 7 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.520
 why 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.429
 clicking on the first one 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.769
 on the first link 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.809
 we find some themes to download on our 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 computer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 I have already done a test downloading some but I will show you now 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.980
 downloading one what happens 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.500
 let's try for example to download the ferrari theme, then click on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 download 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850
 let's wait 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 at this moment he will show us the file that is about to download the advice 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.719
 to save the file 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.509
 because I also like you very much to keep one 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.700
 and in a cgi-bin folder I download 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.070
 so I wait for the download of my theme to finish and then start the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 the installation 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810
 here is finally finished 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 I can then start it I do 2 click 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.150
 decompression 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230
 and as you can see the semide seed theme installed 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 on my computer 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.860
 so what does a theme do that replaces my background 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.950
 with another background that lies in the pack tell me 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 which it replaces however also 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.250
 the taskbar 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.680
 also there 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.530
 display 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 folders for and as you see changed to red 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.990
 so how do we change a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.869
 in the theme or change the right button and customize 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.239
 here we have a screen where we can find all the themes we have 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.570
 downloaded of course 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.420
 and also change the color of the windows sad example we do not like 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.090
 we can safely in the blue sky 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.900
 no one forbids us to code the study's intensity of color example to render it 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.409
 even transparent 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.159
 real transparency is active so making it like for example was a gift 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.079
 belgique 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.319
 and so on 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.709
 lymphocele very interesting and that I really enjoy and that of being able to change 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.609
 the background of our computer 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.269
 every few minutes every dog ​​break theme we download a series of images 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.360
 how can you see this 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.500
 some ferrari machines 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.659

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.829

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.990

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.110
 top section windows 7 themes 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.809
 if use phoenix - past 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.239
 which explains how to enable the buenas themes run on our system 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:44.090
 why 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.430
 and depending on the aliani if ​​of the insolation of our system 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.050
 operational depending on the country 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.460
 in the country we choose from 20 Italy 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.930
 you need to install themes related to our country 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.009
 indeed 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.960
 we can go and see 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.969
 that the italy theme is installed 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.200
 so obviously with some 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.290
 with someone 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.670
 backgrounds and responsive to the country trenitalia ecopass 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.979
 if we love that guide it will be possible to enable everyone 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.819
 the other backgrounds the other themes that were present then on other regions 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.710
 for example, now I can think of low countries because I saw it first up 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.089
 on the microsoft site ages 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:34.119
 here too obviously there are really many backgrounds so we can choose 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.639
 to change 20 seconds 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.800
 and wait for our coat of arms to be exchanged 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.680
 our excuse background 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.669
 and this also works perfectly 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.409
 as you can see transparency is a great effect because depending on the 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.120
 background also changes 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.889
