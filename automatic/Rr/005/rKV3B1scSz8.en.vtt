00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
goes on so much smoother when it's a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
goes on so much smoother when it's a
little<00:00:30.599> wet<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> brush

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

eye look I mean you want to wing it up

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.529 
eye look I mean you want to wing it up
to<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> point<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.500> always<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.710> starting<00:00:47.539> at

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to a point and I always like starting at

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.860 
to a point and I always like starting at
the<00:00:49.260> end<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> eye<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> working<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
the end of the eye and working my way in

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
the end of the eye and working my way in
then<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.320> thicker<00:00:52.590> toward<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
then it's going to be thicker toward the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
then it's going to be thicker toward the
end<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.719> then<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.170> thinner

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
end and then it's going to get thinner

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.420 
end and then it's going to get thinner
as<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.340> into<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> eye<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> want
