gonna do is first I think I'm gonna
actually<00:01:20.340> spawn<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> columns<00:01:21.420> at

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actually spawn all of the columns at

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
actually spawn all of the columns at
first<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> basilisk

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
first and then the basilisk

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
first and then the basilisk
I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.729> gonna

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I think that's what I'm actually gonna

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
crazy like almost just gave them one

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.810 
crazy like almost just gave them one
single<00:02:37.750> charge<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.380> drop<00:02:39.040> down<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> ten

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
single charge and drop down like a ten

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.550 
single charge and drop down like a ten
of<00:02:39.850> them<00:02:40.120> which<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.540> really<00:02:41.410> crazy

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

anyway<00:02:41.980> final<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.420> down<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.230> I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
anyway final one and it's down so I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.410

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
think we need to have another round so I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.699 
think we need to have another round so I
want<00:02:46.600> max<00:02:46.690> gonna<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.020> I'm<00:02:47.170> going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.590> actually

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
want max gonna be I'm going to actually

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.040 
want max gonna be I'm going to actually
go<00:02:47.950> into<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.430> third<00:02:49.030> round<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> I'm<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.959> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
go into a third round and I'm going to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.360 
go into a third round and I'm going to
actually<00:02:50.170> double<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> amount<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.040> columns

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
actually double the amount of columns

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.430 
actually double the amount of columns
because<00:02:51.610> 20<00:02:52.060> columns<00:02:52.300> how<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.050> drop<00:02:53.230> down

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
because 20 columns how do you drop down

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440 
because 20 columns how do you drop down
the<00:02:53.500> best<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.010> by<00:02:54.220> 60<00:02:54.670> points<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.180> think

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the best in this by 60 points so I think

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.090 
the best in this by 60 points so I think
I'm<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.780> actually<00:02:55.900> double<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.830> numbers

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
I'm going to actually double the numbers

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.860 
I'm going to actually double the numbers
of<00:02:57.220> columns<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.790> I'll<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.060> guys<00:02:58.090> back<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.720> a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
of columns and I'll see guys back in a

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.460 
of columns and I'll see guys back in a
second

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
second

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
second
alrighty<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.760> third<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.240> final<00:03:01.810> round

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
alrighty so the third and final round

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.710 
alrighty so the third and final round
for<00:03:02.380> today<00:03:02.620> guys<00:03:02.830> look<00:03:03.310> at<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.180> was<00:03:04.510> going

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
for today guys look at this I was going

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.940 
for today guys look at this I was going
to<00:03:04.780> actually<00:03:05.020> just<00:03:05.050> double<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.560> number<00:03:05.830> by

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
to actually just double the number by

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.100 
to actually just double the number by
then<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.370> thought<00:03:06.990> doubling<00:03:07.990> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
then you know I thought doubling the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.300 
then you know I thought doubling the
number<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.920> actually<00:03:09.160> help

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
number is that going to actually help

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.699 
number is that going to actually help
because<00:03:09.760> he<00:03:10.240> almost<00:03:10.750> killed<00:03:11.380> him<00:03:11.560> like

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
because he almost killed him like

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.930 
because he almost killed him like
instantly<00:03:12.280> at<00:03:12.640> two<00:03:13.360> final<00:03:14.080> charges<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:15.130> was

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
instantly at two final charges so I was

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.420 
instantly at two final charges so I was
like<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.269> know<00:03:16.390> what<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.720> need<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.019> definitely

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
like you know what I need to definitely

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.620 
like you know what I need to definitely
double<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.489> number<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.880> add<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.450> bit

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
double the number and add a little bit

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.840 
double the number and add a little bit
more<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.989> I've<00:03:20.050> actually<00:03:20.170> spawned<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.650> 52<00:03:21.430> in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
more so I've actually spawned at 52 in

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.120 
more so I've actually spawned at 52 in
total<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.870> now<00:03:23.440> I'm<00:03:23.650> going<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.920> actually

basileus<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.840> middle<00:04:02.170> against<00:04:03.160> fifty<00:04:03.820> two

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
basileus in the middle against fifty two

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.810 
basileus in the middle against fifty two
golems<00:04:04.900> forty<00:04:05.860> columns<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.459> know<00:04:06.580> what's

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
golems forty columns you know what's

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.729 
golems forty columns you know what's
personally<00:04:07.390> from<00:04:07.510> experience<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:08.230> buffing<00:04:08.650> is

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
personally from experience a buffing is

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:09.810 
personally from experience a buffing is
going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.130> enough<00:04:09.340> this<00:04:09.459> is<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.700> only

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
going to be enough this is the only

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.940 
going to be enough this is the only
reason<00:04:10.150> why<00:04:10.390> I've<00:04:10.540> actually<00:04:10.660> spawned<00:04:11.049> 53

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
reason why I've actually spawned 53

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.550 
reason why I've actually spawned 53
because<00:04:12.250> 20<00:04:12.760> dropped<00:04:13.450> him<00:04:13.570> down<00:04:13.600> by<00:04:13.840> 60<00:04:14.230> so<00:04:14.440> if

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
because 20 dropped him down by 60 so if

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.530 
because 20 dropped him down by 60 so if
I<00:04:14.650> actually<00:04:14.739> have<00:04:15.040> about<00:04:15.190> 40<00:04:15.820> we<00:04:16.180> might<00:04:16.359> just

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
I actually have about 40 we might just

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.570 
I actually have about 40 we might just
be<00:04:16.630> able<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> drop<00:04:17.019> him<00:04:17.200> down<00:04:17.290> by<00:04:17.500> about<00:04:17.590> 120<00:04:18.130> so

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
be able to drop him down by about 120 so

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.719 
be able to drop him down by about 120 so
there's<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.790> but<00:04:19.030> 80<00:04:19.630> points<00:04:20.200> left<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.580> is

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
there's a but 80 points left so this is

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.890 
there's a but 80 points left so this is
on<00:04:21.849> reason<00:04:22.180> why<00:04:22.270> I've<00:04:22.330> actually<00:04:22.479> spawned<00:04:22.780> at

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
on reason why I've actually spawned at

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.840 
on reason why I've actually spawned at
53<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:24.460> might

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
53 we might

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.850 
53 we might
have<00:04:25.060> koala<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.750> Gollum's<00:04:26.110> at<00:04:26.260> left<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.650> might

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
have koala of Gollum's at left we might

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.310 
have koala of Gollum's at left we might
have<00:04:27.040> none<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.760> left<00:04:28.030> because<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:28.810> panics

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
have none that left because this panics

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.110 
have none that left because this panics
as<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.620> guys<00:04:29.770> saw<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.580> second<00:04:31.030> round

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
as you guys saw in the second round

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.240 
as you guys saw in the second round
right<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:31.840> there<00:04:32.020> he's<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:32.260> like<00:04:32.590> really

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
right and there he's just like really

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.850 
right and there he's just like really
charged<00:04:33.670> like<00:04:33.790> only<00:04:34.180> twice<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.860> killed

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
charged like only twice and killed

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.300 
charged like only twice and killed
almost<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:36.640> ten<00:04:36.940> columns<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.650> doing<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.830> by

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
almost like ten columns so doing this by

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.280 
almost like ten columns so doing this by
spawning<00:04:39.640> 53<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.270> think<00:04:40.750> these<00:04:40.840> areas<00:04:41.140> are

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
spawning 53 I think these areas are

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.860 
spawning 53 I think these areas are
going<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> 1<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> big<00:04:42.880> chance<00:04:43.570> for<00:04:43.690> the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
going to be a 1 a big chance for the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.720 
going to be a 1 a big chance for the
best<00:04:44.050> honest<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.380> win<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.740> by<00:04:44.950> charging<00:04:45.550> and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
best honest to win it by charging and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.940 
best honest to win it by charging and
doing<00:04:46.270> some<00:04:46.420> crazy<00:04:46.750> attacks<00:04:47.110> all<00:04:47.350> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
doing some crazy attacks all the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.250 
doing some crazy attacks all the
basileus<00:04:48.550> might<00:04:48.970> go<00:04:49.270> down<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> bike<00:04:49.930> getting

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
basileus might go down a bike getting

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100 
basileus might go down a bike getting
charged<00:04:50.830> by<00:04:51.100> all<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.850> 52<00:04:52.330> guns<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:52.870> think

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
charged by all the 52 guns and I think

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.390 
charged by all the 52 guns and I think
you<00:04:53.200> know<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:53.410> so<00:04:53.620> far<00:04:53.830> thing<00:04:54.040> they<00:04:54.160> didn't

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
you know what so far thing they didn't

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.740 
you know what so far thing they didn't
well<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.550> wasn't<00:04:54.730> actually<00:04:55.030> expecting<00:04:55.090> them<00:04:55.570> to

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
well I wasn't actually expecting them to

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.530 
well I wasn't actually expecting them to
be<00:04:56.020> attacking<00:04:56.770> him<00:04:56.920> like<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.640> in<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:58.060> larger

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
be attacking him like so in a larger

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.780 
be attacking him like so in a larger
groups<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:59.050> thought<00:04:59.530> oh<00:04:59.740> my<00:05:00.100> gosh<00:05:00.280> he<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:00.460> down

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
groups I thought oh my gosh he is down

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.050 
groups I thought oh my gosh he is down
oh<00:05:01.230> my<00:05:02.230> goodness<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:03.040> can't<00:05:03.340> believe<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.910> was

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
oh my goodness I can't believe it I was

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.330 
oh my goodness I can't believe it I was
not<00:05:04.270> expecting<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:05.080> oh<00:05:05.260> my<00:05:05.890> gosh<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:06.220> done

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
not expecting this oh my gosh it's done

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.590 
not expecting this oh my gosh it's done
let's<00:05:06.550> see<00:05:06.640> how<00:05:06.730> -<00:05:06.850> if<00:05:07.090> actually<00:05:07.390> spawn

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
let's see how - if actually spawn

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.060 
let's see how - if actually spawn
another<00:05:07.810> one<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.260> they<00:05:08.410> actually<00:05:08.560> bring<00:05:08.890> him

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
another one can they actually bring him

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.160 
another one can they actually bring him
down<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:09.400> well<00:05:09.610> if<00:05:09.820> they<00:05:10.360> do<00:05:10.420> I<00:05:10.750> think<00:05:10.780> I'll

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
down as well if they do I think I'll

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.960 
down as well if they do I think I'll
just<00:05:11.410> spoon<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.680> pretty<00:05:12.130> much<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.460> they<00:05:12.670> don't

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
just spoon it pretty much if they don't

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.820 
just spoon it pretty much if they don't
they<00:05:13.510> would<00:05:13.750> know<00:05:13.960> how<00:05:14.260> powerful<00:05:14.740> they<00:05:14.800> are

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
they would know how powerful they are

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.220 
they would know how powerful they are
but<00:05:15.220> I<00:05:15.490> was<00:05:15.910> actually<00:05:16.090> expecting<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.690> 52<00:05:17.110> to

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
but I was actually expecting the 52 to

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.780 
but I was actually expecting the 52 to
come<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.590> destroy<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.190> pass<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.520> it's<00:05:18.640> like

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
come and destroy the pass and it's like

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.610 
come and destroy the pass and it's like
that<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.090> think<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.480> only<00:05:19.630> reason<00:05:19.960> why<00:05:20.560> the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
that I think the only reason why the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.800 
that I think the only reason why the
first<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.280> fasteners<00:05:21.760> just<00:05:21.940> went<00:05:22.120> down<00:05:22.270> super

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
first and fasteners just went down super

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.040 
first and fasteners just went down super
freakin<00:05:23.200> crazy<00:05:23.620> down<00:05:24.010> because<00:05:24.970> those<00:05:25.390> diamond

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
freakin crazy down because those diamond

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.540 
freakin crazy down because those diamond
columns<00:05:26.380> in<00:05:26.500> here<00:05:26.650> they<00:05:26.770> all<00:05:26.950> just<00:05:27.220> grouped

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
columns in here they all just grouped

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.730 
columns in here they all just grouped
opt<00:05:27.790> on<00:05:28.000> him<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.330> they<00:05:28.840> do<00:05:28.900> cause<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.410> lot<00:05:29.710> of

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
opt on him and they do cause a lot of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.140 
opt on him and they do cause a lot of
damage<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.400> think<00:05:30.640> this<00:05:30.760> is<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:30.970> only

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
damage and I think this is the only

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.310 
damage and I think this is the only
reason<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.480> wasn't<00:05:31.690> actually<00:05:31.780> expecting<00:05:31.960> that

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
reason I wasn't actually expecting that

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.020 
reason I wasn't actually expecting that
because<00:05:32.440> usually<00:05:32.710> Isaac's<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.640> here<00:05:33.820> when<00:05:33.970> he

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
because usually Isaac's in here when he

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.850 
because usually Isaac's in here when he
hits<00:05:34.210> them<00:05:34.420> they<00:05:34.450> all<00:05:34.690> fly<00:05:35.080> away<00:05:35.110> from<00:05:35.380> him<00:05:35.650> so

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
hits them they all fly away from him so

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.740 
hits them they all fly away from him so
I<00:05:36.070> was<00:05:36.400> expecting<00:05:36.880> this<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.180> happen<00:05:37.360> as<00:05:37.660> you

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
I was expecting this to happen as you

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.510 
I was expecting this to happen as you
guys<00:05:37.930> witnessed<00:05:38.290> in<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.470> first<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:38.920> second

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
guys witnessed in the first and second

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.540 
guys witnessed in the first and second
round<00:05:39.730> but<00:05:40.090> in<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:41.050> third<00:05:41.380> round<00:05:41.740> they<00:05:42.310> have

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
round but in the third round they have

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.910 
round but in the third round they have
right<00:05:43.150> then<00:05:43.360> they<00:05:43.450> have<00:05:43.600> actually<00:05:43.960> killed<00:05:44.260> the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
right then they have actually killed the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.610 
right then they have actually killed the
first<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.490> know<00:05:45.610> basileus<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.450> round<00:05:46.780> 3<00:05:47.080> let's

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
first you know basileus in round 3 let's

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.170 
first you know basileus in round 3 let's
see<00:05:47.800> what<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:48.280> one<00:05:48.340> actually<00:05:48.790> going<00:05:48.910> to<00:05:49.060> do

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
see what this one actually going to do

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.450 
see what this one actually going to do
as<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.510> can<00:05:49.660> see<00:05:49.810> they<00:05:50.200> were<00:05:50.320> still<00:05:50.590> about<00:05:50.860> 30

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
as you can see they were still about 30

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.510 
as you can see they were still about 30
plus<00:05:51.790> a<00:05:52.150> gold<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.230> diamond<00:05:53.770> columns<00:05:54.250> in<00:05:54.400> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
plus a gold and diamond columns in the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.550 
plus a gold and diamond columns in the
arena<00:05:54.730> and<00:05:54.970> he<00:05:55.240> is<00:05:55.420> almost<00:05:55.870> already<00:05:56.080> killed

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
arena and he is almost already killed

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.040 
arena and he is almost already killed
him<00:05:56.770> also<00:05:57.100> his<00:05:57.250> only<00:05:57.460> three<00:05:57.730> left<00:05:58.000> so<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.960> is
