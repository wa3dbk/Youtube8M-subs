00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.940
 nobody wants to stay here 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.059
 The fact is that he knows that the lack 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.320
 here that a lack meaning 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.420
 every fan tanks and he knows that I hello

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.260
 the tv program light tv building

 your happiness your success here now at 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.100
 Today's question came from the lygia 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.910
 birth of santo andrÃ© in abc 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.780
 she tells us the following a theme 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.699
 which is on the agenda of companies is 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.860
 residences the coach and in my training 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.449
 we discussed a lot about it 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.449
 today what is one of the competences 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.110
 more valued in organizations 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.089
 How do you see this theme bonja before 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.610
 talking about the topic is important we 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.170
 we clarify what is residence because 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.879
 I'm sure that word one 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.650
 known to many people who are 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.119
 watching the video plus a great novelty 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.760
 to other 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.290
 if you go to the aurelian dictionary 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.360
 search for the word resilience you will 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.000
 find the following is the property 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.820
 by which the energy stored in a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.680
 deformed body is returned when 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 this strain-causing attention 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.930
 elastic to make it easier to understand 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.820
 think of the fibers of a nylon carpet 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.759
 when you step on when the pressure on 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.640
 they knead and when you 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.490
 pressure they return to normal without 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.109
 no such term in reality 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 he came from engineering but he went 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.909
 adapted to human behavior 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.219
 by psychologists and it is used to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.259
 people who have the capacity to 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.929
 overcome the difficulty of winning the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.420
 adversity and to recover after 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.340
 a difficult situation even more 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 strengthened than before 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.049
 so I can say that the residence 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.240
 can be understood as the capacity 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.819
 the individual has to deal with the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.509
 pressures and difficult situations and 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:59.539
 adverse effects even without prejudice to 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.539
 physical or emotional balance 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.149
 who is this milk can recover 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.720
 after winning a challenge 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.210
 and the more milk you are more to be 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.820
 your ability to be 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.710
 recover without suffering any physical damage 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.280
 or emotional 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.760
 I would say that being resilient is 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.460
 fall a lemon dance step one 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.470
 lemonade because of course problems that will 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.470
 happen all the time in anticipated 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.210
 are part of life itself you lose the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.130
 center every time something happens 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.500
 problem is very difficult to maintain 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.320
 physical and emotional health 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 Today I'll give you seven tips on how to 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.070
 increase their residence thereby helping 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.350
 a better professional and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.710
 consequence a happier human being 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.480
 The first tip is to mentalize 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.060
 their life project even if you do not 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.910
 can perform a short time 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.670
 the frank cheer who was a great physician 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.590
 psychiatrist founder of logotherapy in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.330
 reality he was a prisoner in camps 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.800
 of Nazi concentration 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.530
 he found that people who 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.390
 survived the horrors of the holocaust 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.190
 they were exactly people who had something 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.990
 to make their futures 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
 when you have something that gives meaning to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.690
 your life this is comforting and reduces 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.060
 very anxiety 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.030
 now let's go to the second tip use some 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.860
 method of relaxation and meditation because 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.260
 this helps to maintain the energies in 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.840
 balance and brings more health both 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.350
 physical and emotional 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.870
 The third tip is to do exercises 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.400
 this in addition to reducing stress 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.400
 increases strength increases flexibility 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.310
 and increases resistance soon brings you 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.440
 benefits both for lying and for 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.960
 the emotions what happens in the body 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.600
 happens internally as well and so 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.860
 exercise is so healthy and so 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.670
 productive fourth very interesting tip 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.550
 take risks have the courage to face 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.410
 the password password problems normally 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.670
 it's easier than it looks 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.830
 I always remember the story of a 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.990
 boy who hated to have to 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.240
 reading aloud and teacher always 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.460
 I asked what I wanted to do, he tried 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.810
 be the last in line and with that he 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.820
 suffered twice 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.070
 he suffered all the time waiting until 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.870
 come his turn 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.820
 he suffered at the time of reading it 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.770
 way because I wanted to stay for the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.780
 because he thought it would be steel and not 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.700
 I needed to read but I always gave 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.870
 His turn had come and suffering had 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.700
 been huge 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.340
 One day he decided to do something different. 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.710
 He said today I'll be the first to 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.870
 read what happened he discovered that 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.510
 that day did not know know why not 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.190
 had the suffering of waiting and neither had the 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.140
 suffering from reading because it was so 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.890
 that he did not even have time to go through 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.120
 that 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.120
 The fifth tip is to use creativity to 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.220
 imagination to break the routine for 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.410
 change habits and to solve the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.410
 unforeseen adversities and 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.020
 situations have the courage to 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.740
 pay mico and you will be amazed at 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.190
 who is able to do the nap tip 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.080
 powerful enough to allow you to do 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.890
 contact with emotions 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.640
 sometimes it is necessary and healthy to stay 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:24.810
 sad upset and even afraid and 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.580
 Finally, a liberating tip is the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.830
 love of himself and 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.660
 unlove the pessimists 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.760
 it always allows you to see 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.250
 situations from another angle 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.830
 like the situation of the history of the middle cup 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.410
 full and half empty there are people who look 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.720
 for a glass and see half full and has 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.540
 people who look and see half empty 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.790
 more or less so our look only 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.170
 Good thing they waited for me to start 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.300
 the party 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.040
 It looks like the seat too full that thing 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.050
 Wonderful, I'm really a woman. 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.900
 so that it came wonderful 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.780
 oh no no no no no look what 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.280
 They made me half-empty glass with it. 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.350
 It is neither possible nor expected for 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.260
 party I do not have friends I 'm really 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.880
 unlucky that horrible thing that means 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:18.060
 empty and our phrase today is everything 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.060
 three things were certain that he 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.970
 was always beginning to know that 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.610
 it was necessary to continue and the certainty that 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.130
 be interrupted before terminating and 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.980
 make the new path interrupt 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.610
 make the fall a dance step of fear 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.479
 but here 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:41.400
