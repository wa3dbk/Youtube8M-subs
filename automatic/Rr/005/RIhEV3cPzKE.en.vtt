of light there's the planet light from
about<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> same<00:01:49.170> distance<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> denote<00:01:50.130> E<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
about the same distance the denote E and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you know this light is $200 so makes it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.920 
you know this light is $200 so makes it
ten<00:01:59.430> times<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.789> price<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.479> super<00:02:00.719> flash

ten times the price of the super flash

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.029 
ten times the price of the super flash
but<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:02.039> say<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.630> chargeable<00:02:04.259> via

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
but I will say that it is chargeable via

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.550 
but I will say that it is chargeable via
USB<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.759> pretty<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.090> everyone<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.500> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
USB so pretty much everyone has a lot of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.249 
USB so pretty much everyone has a lot of
charging<00:02:08.690> availability<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.990> with

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
charging availability for that with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.350 
charging availability for that with
their<00:02:11.160> different<00:02:11.460> components<00:02:11.910> for

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
their different components for

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.140 
their different components for
smartphones<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.290> iPads<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.430> iPods<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.030> all

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.360 
again and get different flashes there's
three<00:04:40.230> different<00:04:40.350> modes<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.040> then<00:04:41.220> there's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
three different modes and then there's

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.190 
three different modes and then there's
steady<00:04:41.610> modes<00:04:41.850> as<00:04:42.030> well<00:04:42.060> with<00:04:42.360> low<00:04:42.540> medium<00:04:43.140> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
steady modes as well with low medium and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.950 
steady modes as well with low medium and
high<00:04:44.419> but<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.570> basically<00:04:45.780> does<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:47.280> for<00:04:47.960> for

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
high but that basically does it for for

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.250 
high but that basically does it for for
the<00:04:49.169> denote<00:04:49.470> E<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.760> let<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.060> know<00:04:51.260> here

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the denote E and just let you know here

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.310 
the denote E and just let you know here
is<00:04:52.560> all<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:54.210> mounting<00:04:54.510> brackets<00:04:54.900> they<00:04:55.050> send

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
is all the mounting brackets they send

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.320 
is all the mounting brackets they send
to<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.590> which<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.640> pretty<00:04:56.760> much<00:04:56.880> unheard<00:04:57.000> of

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
to you which is pretty much unheard of

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.150 
to you which is pretty much unheard of
this<00:04:57.600> about<00:04:57.750> seven<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.230> them<00:04:58.350> in<00:04:58.560> there<00:04:59.010> with

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
this about seven of them in there with

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.770 
this about seven of them in there with
different<00:04:59.460> diameters<00:05:00.320> including<00:05:01.320> one<00:05:01.980> that

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
different diameters including one that

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.010 
different diameters including one that
is<00:05:03.780> angled<00:05:04.320> for<00:05:04.650> an<00:05:04.980> arrow<00:05:05.310> see<00:05:05.580> post<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.630> there

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
is angled for an arrow see post so there

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.919 
is angled for an arrow see post so there
you<00:05:07.110> go<00:05:07.230> thanks
