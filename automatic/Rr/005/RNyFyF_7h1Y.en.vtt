00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 there protected by the French hands there 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 that I put it on 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.640
 of course in this part here was a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 book here goes the cover of itself 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 material and will also be coated 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.549
 with Styrofoam decoration then 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.250
 so she'll stay in this one right come 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.750
 some time here I will make an opening and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.920
 as soon as the cap is removed, 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 food fish and this part of UNIVAP 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.979
 athlete will also receive a top 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 to be closed and top decoration 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.759
 So it's like the top is here. 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 cascade right with the cards on top goes 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 Running the water through this hole here is for 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 this distance here as I said here 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.840
 in this part he has the glass and another 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.129
 video I'll put a little screen to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 that the fish do not jump out and that 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.900
 water fall on the small screen and will lose 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 Wednesday, a TV in those of mosquito nets 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.209
 I'll still think 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.010
 I'll do it when I leave to be able to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.489
 feed the fish but this should not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.380
 having difficulties is easy to do 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.690
 so here is the top 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.150
 sure the places of easy fit is a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.950
 location for led lamp or planting 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 God damn it, but here I go. 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.850
 put led right led and think it's a 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.670
 deceitfulness and which amounts to 15 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.760
 watts of a normal lamp right all 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 nice down here that's gonna stay 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.190
 the white and green lamps that I go 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.450
 put the external gear that I go 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.790
 illuminate with led also the cascade where 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.799
 will drop the decoration here from above 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.430
 parts external to the outside here 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.580
 where you will stay the mountain of stones 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.280
 so artificial the neighboring trees 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.500
 nec will actually be done 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.750
 how I said my idea of ​​doing this 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.359
 kind of worth the balances so I put 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.269
 the dinosaurs in the dinosaur son of 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.910
 Rub it things well for one. 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.190
 decoration for him to enjoy something 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.810
 different is not to decorate to stay 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.850
 along with with aquarium we can not people 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.870
 can enjoy the fish in the bottom 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.030
 and also cut the top part of it is clear that 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.030
 this external environment at the top 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.790
 of the picture is something that will bother 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.690
 somewhat by the following by the noise that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.609
 the water dripping into the waterfall makes it fall 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 in the water forty is something like that 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.590
 You are the one to do the tests and you should 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.650
 To do something has to have a 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.180
 little deputy so you can 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.250
 access when you want 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.829
 when you come to visit or if you have 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.480
 At that quiet moment you want to hear the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.480
 water rushing 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.180
 if you are watching a tv something 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.850
 this noise is bound to disrupt 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.350
 the same case of those saints , 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.539
 aquarium of water that is falling that 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.549
 noise there and that noise of water 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.640
 dripping to the smashing samp 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.500
 so here it might be that the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.600
 Same thing might not happen, it will. 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.220
 make the noise of falling water 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.390
 but then also how I said what I like 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.920
 people who like that noise 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.770
 Quiet sometimes going to get a book. 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.790
 try on the sofa will be listening to reading 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.920
 a book 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.750
 listening to the noise of falling water or 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.980
 to take a nap on the sofa and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.940
 helps a lot 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.040
 But you do not have to go, you have to have a notion. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.850
 that really this noise bothers you 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.340
 marinade and cascade falling and then 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.370
 this also I can not even be logical 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.190
 to always have the filter is going to do 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.990
 all filtering of the aquarium as aaa to 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.090
 system in the internal line filter in the 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.280
 aquarium it ends up not having that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.860
 water rushing, right? 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.750
 and then the waterfall will serve even 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.910
 a moment decorative times when 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.920
 Are you relaxing at home listening to that? 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.290
 Shielding tasty falling is going to be okay 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.970
 interesting and forward is posting 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.890
 Glass, I saw the videos of how are you? 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.890
 getting rock to us
