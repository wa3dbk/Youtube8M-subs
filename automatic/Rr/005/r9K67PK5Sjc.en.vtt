00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
instead of going down into this lower

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.780 
instead of going down into this lower
area<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:04.369> like<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> where<00:01:05.670> the

dragon area is the very beginning of the
game<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.880> you'll<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.060> him<00:01:09.180> under<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

so<00:01:10.760> tricky<00:01:11.760> part<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.390> area<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so tricky part about this area is is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
so tricky part about this area is is
that<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> dark<00:01:15.930> part<00:01:16.320> all

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that when you get into the dark part all

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.270 
that when you get into the dark part all
these<00:01:17.040> skeletons<00:01:17.640> revive<00:01:18.570> constantly<00:01:19.500> unless

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
these skeletons revive constantly unless

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.390 
these skeletons revive constantly unless
you<00:01:20.580> kill<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.360> ways<00:01:21.540> one

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
you kill them one of two ways one

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
you kill them one of two ways one
further<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.240> kill<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
further you can kill they have a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320 
further you can kill they have a
summoner<00:01:25.950> every<00:01:26.430> group<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> skeletons<00:01:27.210> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
like right here's the first one so you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.410 
like right here's the first one so you
the<00:01:35.340> easiest<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.090> run

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the easiest way to do it is just run

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
the easiest way to do it is just run
past<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> skeletons<00:01:37.500> kill<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> summoner

getting through this first area it's
easiest<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.439> run<00:01:58.740> past<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
easiest just to run past all the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.569 
easiest just to run past all the
skeletons<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.920> just<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> Summoner

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
skeletons and just get to the Summoner

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
skeletons and just get to the Summoner
but<00:02:03.000> craft<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.570> divine<00:02:03.869> weapon<00:02:04.079> anyway<00:02:04.619> you're

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
but craft a divine weapon anyway you're

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
but craft a divine weapon anyway you're
going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> need<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.299> fight<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
going to need it when you fight a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to need it when you fight a
gravelord<00:02:07.619> nito<00:02:07.649> which<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> along

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
gravelord nito which is kind of along

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.520 
gravelord nito which is kind of along
this<00:02:09.599> path<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.259> not

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
this path and you will not

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.990 
this path and you will not
for<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> sake<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:12.800> simplicity<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.640> will<00:02:13.760> not

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
for the sake of simplicity you will not

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.130 
for the sake of simplicity you will not
be<00:02:14.209> leaving<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.049> whole<00:02:15.530> wing<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.909> game

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
be leaving this whole wing of the game

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.470 
be leaving this whole wing of the game
until<00:02:18.190> much<00:02:19.190> much<00:02:19.220> later

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.990 

so<00:02:23.480> craft<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.230> divine<00:02:24.560> weapon<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.909> know

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
so craft a divine weapon just you know

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150 
so craft a divine weapon just you know
look<00:02:26.239> on<00:02:26.360> one<00:02:26.659> of<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> wiki's<00:02:27.170> how<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.980> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
look on one of the wiki's how to do it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
look on one of the wiki's how to do it
basically<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.819> have<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.319> to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
basically you have to get you have to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.990 
basically you have to get you have to
have<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> special<00:02:30.739> ember<00:02:31.250> which<00:02:31.519> even<00:02:31.819> if

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
have a special ember which even if

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.130 
have a special ember which even if
you've<00:02:32.209> been<00:02:32.330> following<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.780> guide<00:02:32.959> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
you've been following this guide and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.650 
you've been following this guide and
exploring<00:02:33.709> you'll<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.390> have<00:02:35.420> to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
exploring you'll have and you have to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.100 
exploring you'll have and you have to
craft<00:02:35.959> any<00:02:36.910> weapon<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.120> +10<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.079> then<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:41.110> think

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
craft any weapon to +10 and then I think

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.580 
craft any weapon to +10 and then I think
take<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.590> blacksmith<00:02:43.069> Andre<00:02:43.610> who<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
take it to blacksmith Andre who is the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.559 
take it to blacksmith Andre who is the
huge<00:02:45.590> blacksmith<00:02:46.629> in<00:02:47.629> Anor<00:02:48.110> Londo<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:49.569> then

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
huge blacksmith in Anor Londo and then

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.460 
huge blacksmith in Anor Londo and then
you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.849> craft<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.940> divine<00:02:53.150> weapon<00:02:53.569> oh<00:02:53.599> so

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
you can craft the divine weapon oh so

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.039 
you can craft the divine weapon oh so
that<00:02:54.910> that's<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.150> other<00:02:56.299> way<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.540> kill<00:02:56.930> the
