00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hey that happens fans welcome a new 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.049
 review today I bring you to 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.090
 pups manse with a report his second 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.530
 black letter in which as you see it comes out 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.830
 center forward and has some 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 87 rhythm spectacular statistics 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.039
 87 shot of 87 dribble endorse it as 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.850
 You see its price in player where the 179 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.800
 thousand coins and in xbox 159 thousand if what 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 you want to buy buy it as soon as possible 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
 because it's going up in price since I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 I got caught in the 'boxing day' why 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.280
 it was so cheap in 15 games has 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
 got 28 goals and three assists as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 You see he has four skills but he has three 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 bad leg but I tell you that your 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 right leg 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.500
 it's horrible, that is, they do not put one with the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.750
 right your speed is incredible 87 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 rhythm that for me is much more because 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 added to your changes of address 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
 they make unstoppable and leave who wants 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 but as I tell you his right leg is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.190
 horrible but his quality shot with the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 left is that you aim it absolutely 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 everything so let's see their states in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 game how are you seeing your statistics 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.330
 we are surprised that almost all are in 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.580
 green 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.870
 or green light the most remarkable thing are 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 that 92 agility 87 of acceleration 87 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.130
 of effect 90 of dribbling 90 definition and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.580
 84 shooting power is 23 years old 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.980
 southpaw has worlds high middle has 4 of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.830
 filigree and 3 bad leg and as 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.720
 specialty has acrobat as it is already 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 tradition the same of views let's see 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.790
 some great golazos and talk 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.830
 deeply from each state 87 of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.100
 rhythm for me has a lot more has 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.840
 over 90 93 since it has a few changes of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.820
 direction that Christian usually does 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 ronaldo that for me are unstoppable is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 that you take the central you handle me and not 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.369
 you are able to stop it is impossible 87 of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.160
 shot for me with the left handed has about 90 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.470
 95 because he puts everything in addition the shot of 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.119
 quality with the left-handed is very good but 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.990
 with the right leg and I tell you 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.510
 has about 60 or 50 of shot 79 of pass 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 I already told you that I would like to try what 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.530
 offensive midfielder because his 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.670
 statistics are ideal so there will be 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.319
 to prove it from mc today we can evaluate 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 87 dribble for me has a dribble 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.989
 spectacular is very agile added with its 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.270
 speed is unstoppable 2 I say it 32 of 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 defense that a center forward I can not 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.030
 evaluate it in this aspect and 70 of physical 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.550
 that for me it's something more about 75 76 already 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 that with its speed does not stop anyone 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.620
 with a body so for me the physical 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.300
 it's pretty good and this is all for today 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 guys, I hope you liked the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.410
 review that you leave a like to support it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 and see you in the next video chao 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.890
 - had fewer videos but more quality 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.780
 because I live just up games 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.760
 the end looking let see that they were going 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.010
 crying so much I get it wrong goes by the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 window feeding crack I take the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.560
 betting galicia on the heart support 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.560
 for the Celtic
