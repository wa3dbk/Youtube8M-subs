and for games like me I'll show you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.669 
and for games like me I'll show you
games<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:08.190> requires<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.619> requires

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
games like this it requires it requires

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.309 
games like this it requires it requires
like<00:02:11.599> position<00:02:12.650> control<00:02:13.650> because

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
like position control because

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.819 
like position control because
is<00:02:14.379> very<00:02:14.590> difficult<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.129> control<00:02:15.249> this<00:02:15.719> so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
is very difficult to control this so

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:26.489 
is very difficult to control this so
moving<00:02:17.829> in<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:24.540> I'm<00:02:25.540> controlling<00:02:26.019> is<00:02:26.230> my

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:26.499 
moving in for you I'm controlling is my

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:40.349 
moving in for you I'm controlling is my
controller<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:35.790> playing<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> playing<00:02:39.730> at<00:02:40.180> an

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
controller and playing and playing at an

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.429 
controller and playing and playing at an
emulator

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
emulator

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:49.890 
emulator
this<00:02:41.799> will<00:02:42.099> be<00:02:44.400> first<00:02:45.510> okay<00:02:48.389> okay<00:02:49.389> this<00:02:49.659> would

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
this will be first okay okay this would

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
this will be first okay okay this would
be<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.200> B<00:02:50.439> button<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.700> B<00:02:52.199> this<00:02:53.199> will<00:02:53.409> be<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.739> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
be the B button the B this will be the a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.990 
be the B button the B this will be the a
so<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.359> usual<00:02:55.949> control<00:02:56.949> and<00:02:57.219> four

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
so this is the usual control and four

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.780 
so this is the usual control and four
star<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.599> our<00:02:59.199> three<00:02:59.939> for<00:03:00.939> slack<00:03:01.419> would<00:03:01.629> be<00:03:02.790> B

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
star is our three for slack would be B

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.890 
star is our three for slack would be B
the<00:03:04.000> l3<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.699> folded<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.269> Gameboy

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
the l3 so this is folded like Gameboy

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.550 
the l3 so this is folded like Gameboy
emulators<00:03:08.939> controlling<00:03:13.109> let<00:03:14.109> me<00:03:14.199> try<00:03:14.379> going

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
emulators controlling let me try going

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:29.970 
emulators controlling let me try going
to<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.829> battle<00:03:15.280> with<00:03:15.430> this

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:45.810
