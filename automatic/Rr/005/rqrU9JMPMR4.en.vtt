to do next here we go so this is a bit
of<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.649> like<00:00:59.800> now<00:01:00.929> we're<00:01:01.929> going<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.109> wait<00:01:02.319> for

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
a little while it tells me it's not

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.149 
a little while it tells me it's not
responding<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.650> he<00:01:05.710> moves<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
background so you know in some ways it's

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.730 
background so you know in some ways it's
a<00:01:09.820> bit<00:01:09.939> of<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.119> deal<00:01:10.420> breaker<00:01:10.600> because<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.560> does

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
a bit of a deal breaker because it does

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
but you get quite a lot of difference

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
but you get quite a lot of difference

information if I'm a baby you
moving<00:01:26.670> quick<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.149> it's<00:01:30.420> all

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
moving quick you get to see it's all

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.889 
moving quick you get to see it's all
very<00:01:30.810> nicely<00:01:31.049> presented<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.270> seems<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
very nicely presented if it seems to

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.270 
very nicely presented if it seems to
have<00:01:34.020> cut<00:01:34.140> over<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> takes<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
have cut over it's like maybe it takes a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
have cut over it's like maybe it takes a
little<00:01:35.399> bit<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little bit of time so you can see you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.800 
little bit of time so you can see you
can<00:01:40.289> tap<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:41.390> ribbon<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:43.399> what<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.579> for

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.340 

and<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.079> gone<00:01:49.259> again<00:01:50.899> but<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> gives<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and that's gone again but that gives you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
and that's gone again but that gives you
a<00:01:52.619> quick<00:01:52.979> inside<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.789> like<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> say

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
a quick inside and like I say

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.639 
a quick inside and like I say
unfortunately<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.110> let<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.799> kill<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
unfortunately just let it kill it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.979 
unfortunately just let it kill it
unfortunately<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.429> a<00:01:59.459> bit<00:01:59.700> laggy<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.750> did

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
unfortunately it is a bit laggy so did

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.330 
unfortunately it is a bit laggy so did

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.370 
well we hope it isn't any
so<00:02:35.069> there<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> am<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.480> perhaps<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.900> quite

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
so there I am so it's perhaps not quite

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.140 
so there I am so it's perhaps not quite
as<00:02:37.470> nice<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:37.950> presented

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.750 

but<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.959> well<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> say<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:44.489> clear

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
but it's well I say that it's very clear

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.190 
but it's well I say that it's very clear
you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.360> all<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> details<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.019> very

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you can see all the details are very

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.740 
you can see all the details are very
easily<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.700> we<00:02:47.849> swap<00:02:48.090> side<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> side

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
easily and again we swap side to side

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.830 
easily and again we swap side to side
because<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.799> don't<00:02:50.129> there's<00:02:50.280> any<00:02:50.400> lag<00:02:50.720> in<00:02:51.720> this

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
because I don't there's any lag in this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.539 
because I don't there's any lag in this
case<00:02:52.049> I'm<00:02:52.470> twenty-six<00:02:52.920> percent<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.310> my<00:02:53.370> shots

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
case I'm twenty-six percent of my shots

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.119 
case I'm twenty-six percent of my shots
to<00:02:53.700> kill<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.970> head<00:02:54.090> shots<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.859> little

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
to kill the head shots like this little

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.929 
to kill the head shots like this little
section<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:01.129> six<00:03:02.129> percent<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.549> time<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
section so six percent of the time of

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.300 
section so six percent of the time of
the<00:03:03.150> best<00:03:03.359> player<00:03:03.599> on<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> server<00:03:04.099> almost<00:03:05.099> one

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the best player on the server almost one

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.860 
the best player on the server almost one
in<00:03:05.459> ten<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> second<00:03:06.329> best<00:03:06.480> balance

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
many you've got of each one same as fast

many you've got of each one same as fast
medals<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:43.049> would<00:03:43.260> probably<00:03:43.409> it's<00:03:43.709> a

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
medals this would probably it's a

weapons<00:03:44.220> click<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.609> there<00:03:44.790> they<00:03:44.939> told<00:03:45.209> me<00:03:45.359> what

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
weapons click on there they told me what

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.860 
weapons click on there they told me what
I<00:03:45.510> need<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.689> do<00:03:47.299> for<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.389> different<00:03:48.629> unlocks

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
I need to do for the different unlocks

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.119 
I need to do for the different unlocks
there<00:03:50.900> same<00:03:51.900> with<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.109> vehicles<00:03:52.620> than<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
there same with the vehicles than the

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.550 
there same with the vehicles than the
assignments<00:03:56.840> that's<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.199> there's<00:03:58.440> not

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
assignments that's it so there's not

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.020 
assignments that's it so there's not
quite<00:03:58.859> as<00:03:59.099> much<00:03:59.280> information<00:03:59.549> i<00:03:59.940> would

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
quite as much information i would

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.449 
quite as much information i would
suggest<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.449> it's<00:04:00.569> not<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:00.959> pretty<00:04:01.169> but<00:04:01.590> it's

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
suggest and it's not as pretty but it's

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.920 
suggest and it's not as pretty but it's
probably<00:04:02.639> much<00:04:02.879> more<00:04:02.940> functional<00:04:03.359> because

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
probably much more functional because

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.930 
probably much more functional because
it's<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.409> smooth<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.919> mean<00:04:05.069> how<00:04:05.190> easy<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.879> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it's so smooth I mean how easy is it to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's so smooth I mean how easy is it to
move<00:04:06.239> between<00:04:06.690> them<00:04:06.989> here<00:04:07.319> so<00:04:08.389> that<00:04:09.389> one's<00:04:09.540> bf3

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
