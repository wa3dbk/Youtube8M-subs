00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.900 

okay<00:00:14.380> so<00:00:14.440> how<00:00:14.740> can<00:00:14.889> we<00:00:15.070> know<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.280> intervals

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
okay so how can we know the intervals

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.589 
okay so how can we know the intervals
positional<00:00:16.689> ingot<00:00:16.990> are<00:00:17.199> very<00:00:18.070> easy<00:00:18.220> so<00:00:19.029> we

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
positional ingot are very easy so we

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.570 
positional ingot are very easy so we
will<00:00:19.750> get<00:00:19.960> shapes<00:00:20.349> here<00:00:20.770> of<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.250> fretboard

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
will get shapes here of the fretboard

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.769 
will get shapes here of the fretboard
with<00:00:22.150> reference<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.140> finger<00:00:24.009> one<00:00:24.250> so<00:00:25.180> you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
with reference of the finger one so you

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.100 
with reference of the finger one so you
suppose<00:00:26.259> we<00:00:26.349> do<00:00:26.470> here<00:00:26.710> from<00:00:26.950> G<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.810> is<00:00:28.869> the

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
suppose we do here from G this is the

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.100 
suppose we do here from G this is the
fifth<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:29.980> fifth<00:00:30.399> of<00:00:31.079> g-d<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:34.630> point<00:00:34.960> of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
fifth so fifth of g-d my point of

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.560 
fifth so fifth of g-d my point of
reference<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.100> interval<00:00:36.520> we<00:00:37.180> are<00:00:37.239> we

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
reference this is the interval we are we

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.500 
reference this is the interval we are we
are<00:00:37.630> looking<00:00:38.110> for<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:38.950> fifths<00:00:39.790> will<00:00:40.180> be<00:00:40.329> like

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
are looking for so fifths will be like

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:54.020 
are looking for so fifths will be like
this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.500 

yeah<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.149> finger<00:00:55.449> wet<00:00:55.659> all<00:00:55.809> day<00:00:55.839> here<00:00:56.829> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
yeah this finger wet all day here and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
yeah this finger wet all day here and
with<00:00:58.510> two<00:00:58.809> space<00:00:59.710> of<00:00:59.949> two<00:01:00.760> frets<00:01:01.089> of<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.390> space

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
with two space of two frets of a space

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.690 
with two space of two frets of a space
and<00:01:03.190> then<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.530> these<00:01:05.649> are<00:01:05.830> all<00:01:05.950> intervals<00:01:06.460> of

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
and then so these are all intervals of

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then so these are all intervals of
5th<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.170> we<00:01:08.200> can<00:01:08.470> say<00:01:09.750> fifth<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:11.020> c<00:01:12.299> g<00:01:14.940> then

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
5th so we can say fifth of c g then

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
5th so we can say fifth of c g then

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.619 

Ishod<00:01:52.599> right<00:01:52.869> but<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.649> say<00:01:53.830> here<00:01:54.099> also<00:01:54.629> be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:55.629 
Ishod right but you can say here also be

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:01.469 
Ishod right but you can say here also be
flat<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.119> make<00:01:58.560> things<00:01:59.560> simple<00:02:00.479> B

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
flat so just to make things simple B

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.119 
flat so just to make things simple B
flat<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:02.289> not<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.560> interval<00:02:05.979> will

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
flat is not and here this interval will

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:12.930 
flat is not and here this interval will
be<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.700> fetus<00:02:07.149> is<00:02:07.330> f

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.290 

and<00:02:13.940> then<00:02:14.180> lift<00:02:14.720> off<00:02:14.960> earth<00:02:15.610> see<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and then lift off earth see this is the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.540 
and then lift off earth see this is the
circle<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.750> fifths<00:02:18.020> here<00:02:26.290> right<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:28.010> thoughts

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
circle of fifths here right now thoughts

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.670 
circle of fifths here right now thoughts
you<00:02:28.910> know<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.730> my<00:02:32.060> note

basically say gee and if I want to know

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
basically say gee and if I want to know
what<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> ford<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.920> G<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.240> do

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.050 

now<00:02:43.500> from<00:02:44.500> day<00:02:44.739> fifth<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> fourth<00:02:45.730> like

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
now from day fifth to the fourth like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:03:00.640 
now from day fifth to the fourth like
the<00:02:48.060> 6<00:02:49.060> 250<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:51.160> interval<00:02:51.700> them

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.250 

so<00:03:01.650> forth<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.099> then<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:05.239> anyone<00:03:06.260> then

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
so forth and then for you to anyone then

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:27.770 
so forth and then for you to anyone then
obviously<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.770> augmented<00:03:21.260> minor<00:03:22.260> third<00:03:26.780> look

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
obviously for augmented minor third look

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.030 
obviously for augmented minor third look
at<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.019> shapes<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> course<00:03:28.920> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
at the shapes on you of course you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.470 
at the shapes on you of course you
should<00:03:29.220> know<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.580> intervals<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.239> come

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
should know the intervals and come

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.630 
should know the intervals and come
properly<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.140> no<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.799> are<00:03:32.400> many

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
properly and no there there are many

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.110 
properly and no there there are many
value<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.430> helpful<00:03:35.640> to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
value of this but this can be helpful to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.890 
value of this but this can be helpful to
find<00:03:36.510> interest<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.620> quick<00:03:37.830> way<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
find interest in a quick way and so you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.009 
find interest in a quick way and so you
get<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.319> here<00:03:40.980> some<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.090> don't<00:03:42.299> third<00:03:42.540> so

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
get this here some I don't third so

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.470 
get this here some I don't third so
suppose<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.500> g<00:03:44.420> minor<00:03:45.420> third<00:03:47.239> then<00:03:48.239> i<00:03:48.390> do<00:03:49.370> see

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
suppose from g minor third then i do see

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.860 
suppose from g minor third then i do see
flat<00:03:51.620> minor<00:03:52.620> third<00:03:52.980> of
