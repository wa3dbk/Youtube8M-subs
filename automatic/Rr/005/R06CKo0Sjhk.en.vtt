in<00:00:03.989> this<00:00:04.529> tutorial<00:00:04.800> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> look<00:00:05.819> at

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939 
in this tutorial we're going to look at

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.230 
in this tutorial we're going to look at
the<00:00:06.060> Camera<00:00:06.420> Raw<00:00:06.599> lab<00:00:06.870> within<00:00:07.170> photo<00:00:07.529> paint<00:00:08.240> so

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the Camera Raw lab within photo paint so

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940 
the Camera Raw lab within photo paint so
to<00:00:09.300> bring<00:00:09.480> an<00:00:09.660> image<00:00:09.809> into<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.469> Camera<00:00:10.770> Raw

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to bring an image into the Camera Raw

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.940 
to bring an image into the Camera Raw
lab<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.430> two<00:00:11.730> options<00:00:12.380> one<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.740> go<00:00:13.890> to

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
lab you have two options one is to go to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.359 
lab you have two options one is to go to
file<00:00:14.309> import<00:00:15.320> but<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.439> this<00:00:16.590> particular<00:00:17.099> case

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
file import but in this particular case

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.339 
file import but in this particular case
it's<00:00:17.910> grayed<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.900> don't<00:00:19.019> have<00:00:19.140> an

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
it's grayed out because we don't have an

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.499 
it's grayed out because we don't have an
image<00:00:19.589> open<00:00:19.919> already<00:00:20.220> that's<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.179> only<00:00:21.390> way

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
image open already that's the only way

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.899 
image open already that's the only way
that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.960> use<00:00:21.989> this<00:00:22.289> feature<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> other

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:23.909 
that you can use this feature the other

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.109 
that you can use this feature the other
option<00:00:24.329> is<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.810> file<00:00:25.169> open<00:00:25.739> and<00:00:26.249> then

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
option is to go to file open and then

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.279 
option is to go to file open and then
choose<00:00:27.419> an<00:00:27.599> image<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> image<00:00:31.050> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
choose an image now that the image is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110 
choose an image now that the image is
opened<00:00:31.649> in<00:00:31.739> the<00:00:31.769> Camera<00:00:32.130> Raw<00:00:32.279> lab<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.970> have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
opened in the Camera Raw lab we can have

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
opened in the Camera Raw lab we can have
a<00:00:33.149> look<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.540> some<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> options<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.000> first

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
a look at some of the options here first

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
a look at some of the options here first
off<00:00:36.210> you'll<00:00:36.420> notice<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.019> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.289> interface

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
off you'll notice is that the interface

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.220 
off you'll notice is that the interface
is<00:00:37.769> very<00:00:38.250> similar<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.019> image

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is very similar to that of the image

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
is very similar to that of the image
adjustment<00:00:40.800> lab<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> get

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
adjustment lab so I'm not going to get

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
adjustment lab so I'm not going to get
into<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> controls<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.609> in

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
into what the controls do so much in

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.660 
into what the controls do so much in
this<00:00:45.000> particular<00:00:45.570> tutorial<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> before<00:00:47.550> we

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this particular tutorial so before we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.130 
this particular tutorial so before we
get<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:48.089> working<00:00:48.449> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> image<00:00:48.929> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
get into working with the image the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.599 
get into working with the image the
first<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.589> we<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> look<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
first thing we want to look at is the

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.709 
first thing we want to look at is the
color<00:00:50.789> depth<00:00:51.350> here<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.890> choices

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
color depth here we have two choices

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
color depth here we have two choices
48-bit<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:55.280> 24-bit<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:57.269> one<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.749> about

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
48-bit or 24-bit now one thing about

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.200 
48-bit or 24-bit now one thing about
these<00:00:58.199> two<00:00:58.469> different<00:00:58.589> options<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.399> if

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
these two different options is that if

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.430 
these two different options is that if
you're<00:01:00.449> working<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> higher<00:01:01.260> resolution

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you're working with a higher resolution

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.759 
you're working with a higher resolution
some<00:01:02.429> special<00:01:02.969> effects<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> options<00:01:04.559> such<00:01:04.739> as

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
some special effects and options such as

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
some special effects and options such as
lenses<00:01:05.400> won't<00:01:06.150> work<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> higher<00:01:07.020> bit

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
lenses won't work with a higher bit

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.190 
lenses won't work with a higher bit
depth<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.850> those<00:01:08.970> cases<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.630> recommended

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
depth so in those cases it's recommended

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.800 
depth so in those cases it's recommended
that<00:01:10.230> you<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.500> 24-bit<00:01:11.370> in<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> case<00:01:12.630> we're

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that you use 24-bit in this case we're

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
that you use 24-bit in this case we're
just<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.410> working<00:01:13.620> with<00:01:13.860> color

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
just going to be working with color

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
just going to be working with color
correction<00:01:14.370> within<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.120> Camera<00:01:15.450> Raw<00:01:15.600> lab<00:01:15.870> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
correction within the Camera Raw lab so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.340 
correction within the Camera Raw lab so
that<00:01:16.560> won't<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.980> an<00:01:17.070> issue<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> next<00:01:19.050> thing<00:01:19.230> we

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that won't be an issue the next thing we

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
that won't be an issue the next thing we
want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.620> look<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.980> is<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.310> histogram<00:01:20.640> which

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
want to look at is the histogram which

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.030 
want to look at is the histogram which
gives<00:01:21.630> us<00:01:21.750> information<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.410> what's<00:01:22.770> going

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
gives us information about what's going

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
gives us information about what's going
on<00:01:23.190> in<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.490> image<00:01:23.990> you'll<00:01:24.990> notice<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.440> alert

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
on in the image you'll notice an alert

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
on in the image you'll notice an alert
button<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.190> either<00:01:26.550> side<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.150> image<00:01:27.390> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
button on either side of the image in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.110 
button on either side of the image in
this<00:01:28.080> case<00:01:28.140> they're<00:01:28.770> grayed<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.520> they

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
this case they're grayed out if they

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.580 
this case they're grayed out if they
were<00:01:30.180> illuminated<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.080> would<00:01:31.200> mean<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
were illuminated it would mean that we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590 
were illuminated it would mean that we
have<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.800> problem<00:01:32.250> such<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.520> overexposure<00:01:33.360> or

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have a problem such as overexposure or

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.540 
have a problem such as overexposure or
under<00:01:33.900> exposure<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.980> needs<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.460> be

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
under exposure that needs to be

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.450 
under exposure that needs to be
addressed<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.530> next<00:01:37.770> thing<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> have

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
addressed the next thing we want to have

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.820 
addressed the next thing we want to have
a<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.810> white<00:01:39.960> balance<00:01:40.410> settings

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
a look at is the white balance settings

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.830 
a look at is the white balance settings
you'll<00:01:41.820> notice<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.300> when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> bring<00:01:42.690> an

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you'll notice that when you bring an

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.930 
you'll notice that when you bring an
image<00:01:43.080> into<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> Camera<00:01:43.890> Raw<00:01:44.040> lab<00:01:44.280> the

you<00:04:19.570> have<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> couple<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.199> choices<00:04:20.440> one<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.159> to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
you have a couple of choices one is to

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.240 
you have a couple of choices one is to
use<00:04:21.519> JPEG<00:04:21.990> but<00:04:22.990> if<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.289> do<00:04:23.440> use<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.889> that's<00:04:24.099> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
use JPEG but if you do use that that's a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.310 
use JPEG but if you do use that that's a
lossy<00:04:24.610> format<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.599> don't<00:04:25.840> recommend<00:04:26.260> that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
lossy format so I don't recommend that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.620 
lossy format so I don't recommend that
you<00:04:26.530> use<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.610> other<00:04:27.789> option<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.450> use

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you use it the other option is to use
