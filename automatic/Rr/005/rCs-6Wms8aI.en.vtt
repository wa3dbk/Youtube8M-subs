ornament get ready to hit pause because

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.350 
ornament get ready to hit pause because
here<00:00:10.510> are<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.840> supplies<00:00:11.170> that<00:00:11.469> you'll<00:00:11.650> need

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.790 

fold<00:00:16.360> all<00:00:16.630> 12<00:00:16.960> pieces<00:00:17.380> of<00:00:17.530> wire<00:00:17.740> in<00:00:18.130> half<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
fold all 12 pieces of wire in half and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.760 
fold all 12 pieces of wire in half and
use<00:00:21.610> your<00:00:21.790> pliers<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.340> center<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:25.210> make<00:00:25.770> a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
use your pliers at the center to make a

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.249 
use your pliers at the center to make a
loop<00:00:28.500> where<00:00:29.500> you'll<00:00:29.650> just<00:00:29.830> twist<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:31.000> wires

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
loop where you'll just twist the wires

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.760 
loop where you'll just twist the wires
together<00:00:32.259> as<00:00:32.680> if<00:00:32.829> you<00:00:32.920> had<00:00:33.040> two<00:00:33.280> wires<00:00:33.579> just<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
together as if you had two wires just a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.580 
together as if you had two wires just a
couple<00:00:36.040> of<00:00:36.160> times<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:38.050> now<00:00:38.200> you<00:00:38.260> have<00:00:38.470> this

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
couple of times so now you have this

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.530 
couple of times so now you have this
loop<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.250> middle<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.640> your<00:00:39.760> wires<00:00:39.970> this

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
loop in the middle of your wires this

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.610 
loop in the middle of your wires this
project<00:00:41.050> has<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.470> lot<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:42.100> repetitive<00:00:43.000> steps<00:00:43.620> so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
project has a lot of repetitive steps so

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.720 
project has a lot of repetitive steps so
here's<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.040> first<00:00:45.220> one

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
here's the first one

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.180 
here's the first one
taking<00:00:46.450> one<00:00:46.660> wire<00:00:46.870> at<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.200> time<00:00:47.440> from<00:00:47.710> each<00:00:47.890> side

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
taking one wire at a time from each side

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.270 
taking one wire at a time from each side
twist<00:00:49.090> those<00:00:49.330> two<00:00:49.510> wires<00:00:49.720> together<00:00:50.080> for<00:00:50.740> about

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
twist those two wires together for about

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.200 
twist those two wires together for about
a<00:00:51.520> centimeter<00:00:55.740> you're<00:00:56.740> gonna<00:00:56.830> do<00:00:57.100> this<00:00:57.310> with

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
a centimeter you're gonna do this with

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.890 
a centimeter you're gonna do this with
all<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.480> wires<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.790> 12<00:01:00.790> times<00:01:01.090> you<00:01:01.480> take<00:01:01.660> one

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
all the wires so 12 times you take one

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.740 
all the wires so 12 times you take one
wire<00:01:02.110> from<00:01:02.380> each<00:01:02.620> side<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.509> twist<00:01:04.509> them

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
wire from each side and twist them

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
wire from each side and twist them
together<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.729> centimeter<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.350> more

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
together about a centimeter the more

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.080 
together about a centimeter the more
uniform<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.869> can<00:01:11.110> get<00:01:11.290> all<00:01:11.799> these<00:01:12.340> lengths<00:01:12.909> of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
uniform you can get all these lengths of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.840 
uniform you can get all these lengths of
things<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.530> more<00:01:14.740> uniform<00:01:15.310> your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
things to be the more uniform your

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.670 
things to be the more uniform your
completed<00:01:16.630> Bell<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.619> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.979> look<00:01:18.480> but<00:01:19.680> it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
completed Bell is going to look but it's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.860 
completed Bell is going to look but it's
not<00:01:20.920> necessary<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:21.940> they<00:01:22.120> be<00:01:22.180> completely

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
not necessary that they be completely

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.870 
not necessary that they be completely
uniform<00:01:23.170> if<00:01:23.620> you're<00:01:23.860> not<00:01:24.190> good<00:01:24.520> at<00:01:24.670> making

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
uniform if you're not good at making

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.330 
uniform if you're not good at making
them<00:01:25.210> all<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.510> same<00:01:25.690> don't<00:01:26.680> worry<00:01:26.860> about<00:01:26.980> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
them all the same don't worry about it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.760 
them all the same don't worry about it
the<00:01:27.490> Bell<00:01:27.670> will<00:01:27.970> still<00:01:28.270> look<00:01:29.050> like<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.230> bell

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
the Bell will still look like a bell

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.790 
the Bell will still look like a bell
it<00:01:29.830> just<00:01:30.250> won't<00:01:30.550> hold<00:01:31.479> up<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.590> own

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
it just won't hold up to your own

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.120 
it just won't hold up to your own
intense<00:01:33.310> scrutiny<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:34.240> how<00:01:35.229> perfect<00:01:35.800> or

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
intense scrutiny of how perfect or

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:52.810 
intense scrutiny of how perfect or
imperfect<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:37.240> looks<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.760> last<00:01:39.760> one

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.470 

and<00:01:53.600> they're<00:01:54.230> all<00:01:54.380> twists<00:01:54.740> together<00:01:55.480> space

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
and they're all twists together space

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.030 
and they're all twists together space
out<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.920> 12<00:01:58.370> little<00:01:58.880> twists<00:01:59.650> fairly<00:02:00.650> evenly

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
out the 12 little twists fairly evenly

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.420 
out the 12 little twists fairly evenly
and<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.390> we're<00:02:02.690> gonna<00:02:02.810> start<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:04.010> twist

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and now we're gonna start the twist

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.380 
and now we're gonna start the twist
that's<00:02:04.850> going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.650> make<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:06.920> into<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.670> bell<00:02:08.000> if

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
that's going to make this into a bell if

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.660 
that's going to make this into a bell if
you've<00:02:09.020> ever<00:02:09.200> looked<00:02:09.470> at<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:09.979> piece<00:02:10.040> of<00:02:10.310> chicken

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
you've ever looked at a piece of chicken

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.420 
you've ever looked at a piece of chicken
wire<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:10.970> thought<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.980> could<00:02:12.980> make<00:02:13.130> chicken

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
wire and thought I could make chicken

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.240 
wire and thought I could make chicken
wire<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:15.170> basically<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.890> twist<00:02:16.130> that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
wire that's basically the twist that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430 
wire that's basically the twist that
we're<00:02:16.370> gonna<00:02:16.460> be<00:02:16.640> doing<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.660> take<00:02:17.930> one<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
we're gonna be doing so you take one of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.820 
we're gonna be doing so you take one of
the<00:02:18.560> wires<00:02:18.800> from<00:02:19.690> one<00:02:20.690> side<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.560> twist

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the wires from one side of a twist

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.650 
the wires from one side of a twist
you've<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.250> done<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.730> you're<00:02:23.270> gonna<00:02:23.390> twist

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
you've just done and you're gonna twist

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.560 
you've just done and you're gonna twist
it<00:02:23.990> with<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> wire<00:02:24.770> from<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.030> adjoining

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
it with the wire from the adjoining

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.320 
it with the wire from the adjoining
twists<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.440> you've<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.800> done<00:02:28.040> making<00:02:29.030> this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
twists that you've just done making this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.540 
twists that you've just done making this
little<00:02:29.600> triangle<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:31.160> don't<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.430> if<00:02:31.490> you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
little triangle you don't know if you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.760 
little triangle you don't know if you
can<00:02:31.700> see<00:02:31.820> that<00:02:31.970> little<00:02:32.810> triangle<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
can see that little triangle that I just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.880 
can see that little triangle that I just
made<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.610> work<00:02:34.880> your<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.240> around<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
made and just work your way around the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.240 
made and just work your way around the
circle<00:02:38.680> doing<00:02:39.680> your<00:02:39.860> best<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.880> make<00:02:42.250> every

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
circle doing your best to make every

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
circle doing your best to make every
little<00:02:43.370> triangle<00:02:44.110> even<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.830> doing

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
little triangle even and I'm just doing

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.570 
little triangle even and I'm just doing
five<00:02:46.690> twists<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.950> those<00:02:49.430> are

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
five twists so that I know those are

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 
five twists so that I know those are
gonna<00:02:49.730> turn<00:02:49.970> out<00:02:50.150> even<00:02:50.180> also<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.560> great<00:02:51.890> thing

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
gonna turn out even also the great thing

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.190 
gonna turn out even also the great thing
about<00:02:52.160> wire<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.360> you've<00:02:53.480> got<00:02:53.540> some<00:02:53.959> wires

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
about wire is if you've got some wires

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.610 
about wire is if you've got some wires
that<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.220> feel<00:02:55.459> like<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.820> in<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.150> way<00:02:56.620> just

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that you feel like are in your way just

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.250 
that you feel like are in your way just
push<00:02:57.920> them<00:02:58.070> out<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.430> way<00:02:58.580> now<00:02:59.510> as<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.110> go

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
push them out of the way now as you go

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.199 
push them out of the way now as you go
around<00:03:02.110> you're<00:03:03.110> going<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.769> notice<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.970> in

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
around you're going to notice that in

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.759 
around you're going to notice that in
order<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.510> keep<00:03:05.780> these<00:03:06.550> little<00:03:07.550> triangles

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
order to keep these little triangles

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.240 
order to keep these little triangles
tiny<00:03:09.769> like<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:11.140> your<00:03:12.140> design<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.890> going<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
tiny like this your design is going to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340 
tiny like this your design is going to
have<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.519> start<00:03:13.760> taking<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.420> shape<00:03:14.780> other<00:03:15.110> than

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
have to start taking a shape other than

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.759 
have to start taking a shape other than
just<00:03:15.530> flat<00:03:16.310> out<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.330> sides<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:18.680> gonna

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
just flat out to the sides you're gonna

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.830 
just flat out to the sides you're gonna
have<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.130> start<00:03:19.370> moving<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.209> down<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> bell

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
have to start moving it down like a bell

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.570 
have to start moving it down like a bell
last<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.880> all<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.070> you've<00:03:28.070> gone<00:03:28.310> all

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
last one all right so you've gone all

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.100 
last one all right so you've gone all
the<00:03:28.820> way<00:03:28.850> around<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.720> you've<00:03:30.709> had<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:32.110> start

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
the way around and you've had to start

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.979 
the way around and you've had to start
moving<00:03:33.860> in<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:34.340> direction<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
moving in this direction with the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.870 
moving in this direction with the
twisting<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:36.980> they<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:37.519> stay

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
twisting so that they can all stay

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.630 
twisting so that they can all stay
consistent<00:03:38.890> we're<00:03:39.890> just<00:03:40.070> gonna<00:03:40.160> keep<00:03:40.400> doing

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
consistent we're just gonna keep doing

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.789 
consistent we're just gonna keep doing
the<00:03:40.730> same<00:03:40.910> thing<00:03:41.180> going<00:03:41.570> another<00:03:41.930> round<00:03:42.049> and

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
the same thing going another round and

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.250 
the same thing going another round and
another<00:03:43.100> round<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.700> another<00:03:44.060> round<00:03:44.269> each

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
another round and another round each

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.670 
another round and another round each
round<00:03:45.730> make<00:03:46.730> your<00:03:47.000> triangles<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.230> little<00:03:48.560> bit

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
round make your triangles a little bit

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.630 
round make your triangles a little bit
bigger<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.450> same<00:03:50.630> idea<00:03:51.019> you<00:03:51.110> take

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
bigger but it's the same idea you take

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.490 
bigger but it's the same idea you take
one<00:03:52.640> end<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:53.269> one<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.690> twists<00:03:54.049> you've<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
one end of one of the twists you've just

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.949 
one end of one of the twists you've just
done<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.160> twist<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.580> with<00:03:55.760> one<00:03:56.390> end<00:03:56.660> of

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
done and you twist it with one end of

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.759 
done and you twist it with one end of
the<00:03:57.590> adjoining<00:03:58.010> twist<00:03:58.450> keep<00:03:59.450> just<00:03:59.750> doing<00:04:00.110> five

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
the adjoining twist keep just doing five

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.479 
the adjoining twist keep just doing five
twists<00:04:01.459> in<00:04:01.850> between<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:03.100> one<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.310> things

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
twists in between and one of the things

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.800 
twists in between and one of the things
about<00:04:04.639> chicken<00:04:05.180> wire

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
about chicken wire

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.800 
about chicken wire
is<00:04:05.980> there<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> lot<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.970> flexibility<00:04:08.690> with

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
is there is a lot of flexibility with

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.240 
is there is a lot of flexibility with
shaping<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.880> pull<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:12.470> spaces<00:04:13.130> in

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
shaping it if you pull the spaces in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.300 
shaping it if you pull the spaces in
between<00:04:13.280> together<00:04:14.209> they<00:04:14.630> get<00:04:15.130> skinnier<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
between together they get skinnier and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.460 
between together they get skinnier and
longer<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.940> if<00:04:17.389> you<00:04:17.510> pull<00:04:17.750> them<00:04:17.900> apart<00:04:18.019> they

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
longer and if you pull them apart they

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.970 
longer and if you pull them apart they
get<00:04:18.790> whiter<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:21.340> we'll<00:04:22.340> be<00:04:22.460> able<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.910> make<00:04:23.980> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
get whiter so we'll be able to make the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.640 
get whiter so we'll be able to make the
shape<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:26.930> want<00:04:27.970> so<00:04:28.970> there<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
shape that we want so there is the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.750 
shape that we want so there is the
second<00:04:31.040> round<00:04:31.220> done<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:36.530> do<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.830> same<00:04:37.250> thing

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
second round done you do the same thing

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.840 
second round done you do the same thing
until<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:40.370> have<00:04:40.610> maybe<00:04:41.000> two<00:04:41.860> inches<00:04:42.860> left<00:04:43.340> at

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
until you have maybe two inches left at

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.000 
until you have maybe two inches left at
the<00:04:44.090> end<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.780> we'll<00:04:45.320> do<00:04:45.470> this<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.650> few<00:04:45.889> more

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the end so we'll do this a few more

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.920 
the end so we'll do this a few more
times<00:04:46.070> going<00:04:46.669> around<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.120> exact<00:04:47.510> same<00:04:47.720> way

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
times going around the exact same way

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.030 
times going around the exact same way
getting<00:04:48.290> slightly<00:04:48.800> bigger<00:04:49.010> each<00:04:49.280> time<00:04:49.310> and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
getting slightly bigger each time and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960 
getting slightly bigger each time and
now<00:04:52.040> I'm<00:04:52.130> going<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.280> show<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.490> how<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.700> finish

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
now I'm going to show you how to finish

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.969 
now I'm going to show you how to finish
it<00:04:53.300> once<00:04:53.540> you've<00:04:53.690> gone<00:04:53.870> all<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.410> way<00:04:54.440> all

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
it once you've gone all the way all

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.790 
it once you've gone all the way all
right<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:55.340> done<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:56.810> looks<00:04:57.020> like<00:04:57.139> this

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
right I'm done and it looks like this

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.280 
right I'm done and it looks like this
now<00:04:59.080> so<00:05:00.370> through<00:05:01.370> pulling<00:05:01.760> on<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:03.080> wire

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
now so through pulling on the wire

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.379 
now so through pulling on the wire
gently<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.970> can<00:05:05.180> go<00:05:05.479> ahead<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:06.610> make<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.639> into

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
gently you can go ahead and make it into

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.650 
gently you can go ahead and make it into
more<00:05:08.660> of<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:09.260> bell<00:05:09.680> shape<00:05:10.190> now<00:05:10.490> now<00:05:11.300> for<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
more of a bell shape now now for the

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.380 
more of a bell shape now now for the
very<00:05:11.870> last<00:05:12.140> row<00:05:12.760> go<00:05:13.760> ahead<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.060> move<00:05:14.270> your

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
very last row go ahead and move your

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.050 
very last row go ahead and move your
wires<00:05:14.630> as<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.050> you're<00:05:15.200> gonna<00:05:15.289> start<00:05:15.710> another

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
wires as if you're gonna start another
