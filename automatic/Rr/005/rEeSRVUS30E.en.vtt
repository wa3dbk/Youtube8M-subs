00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
is great for that so this is the figure

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.710 
is great for that so this is the figure
as<00:02:54.709> he<00:02:54.739> comes<00:02:55.070> out<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.430> box<00:02:55.670> he<00:02:56.420> doesn't

as he comes out with the box he doesn't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
have the big clock which I'll show you

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.270 
have the big clock which I'll show you
at<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.700> end<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.120> nothing<00:02:59.750> fantastic<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
at the end it's nothing fantastic and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
at the end it's nothing fantastic and
but<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:01.760> figure<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.269> pretty<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:02.720> without

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
but this figure is pretty good without

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.420 
but this figure is pretty good without
so<00:03:03.320> we<00:03:03.530> don't<00:03:03.709> need<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.890> worry<00:03:04.040> about<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.370> for

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
so we don't need to worry about that for

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.509

these<00:05:15.400> there's<00:05:16.400> not<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.550> lot<00:05:16.759> of<00:05:16.789> texture<00:05:17.240> on

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
these there's not a lot of texture on

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.059 
these there's not a lot of texture on
them<00:05:17.569> parent<00:05:18.169> wires<00:05:18.349> or<00:05:18.560> anything<00:05:18.740> they're

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
them parent wires or anything they're

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.100 
them parent wires or anything they're
just<00:05:19.099> black<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:19.520> they<00:05:20.270> do<00:05:20.449> worth<00:05:20.750> they<00:05:21.020> are

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
just black but they do worth they are

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.519 
just black but they do worth they are
quite<00:05:21.319> nicely<00:05:21.529> sculpted<00:05:22.569> you<00:05:23.569> would<00:05:23.689> think<00:05:23.990> of

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 
quite nicely sculpted you would think of

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.260 
quite nicely sculpted you would think of
a<00:05:24.710> figure<00:05:25.129> of<00:05:25.279> this<00:05:25.400> quality<00:05:25.639> though<00:05:25.969> that

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
a figure of this quality though that

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.029 
a figure of this quality though that
would<00:05:26.509> actually<00:05:26.870> have<00:05:27.020> silver<00:05:27.500> buckles<00:05:27.860> on

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
would actually have silver buckles on

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.610 
would actually have silver buckles on
but<00:05:28.340> never<00:05:28.580> mind<00:05:28.969> maybe<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.050> would<00:05:30.139> stand<00:05:30.409> out

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
but never mind maybe it would stand out

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.680 
but never mind maybe it would stand out
or<00:05:30.650> make<00:05:30.860> him<00:05:30.949> look<00:05:31.069> a<00:05:31.129> bit<00:05:31.340> silly<00:05:31.690> something

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
or make him look a bit silly something

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.360 
or make him look a bit silly something
that<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:32.930> good<00:05:33.139> on<00:05:33.259> this<00:05:33.440> figure<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.219> it's

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
that is good on this figure and it's

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.040 
that is good on this figure and it's
just<00:05:34.580> by<00:05:34.759> pure<00:05:35.029> fluke<00:05:35.389> of<00:05:35.569> the<00:05:35.629> color<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:35.930> his

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
just by pure fluke of the color of his

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.469 
just by pure fluke of the color of his
skin<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:37.250> really<00:05:37.520> hard<00:05:37.699> to<00:05:37.849> see<00:05:38.029> the<00:05:38.060> joints

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
skin it's really hard to see the joints

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.010 
skin it's really hard to see the joints
on<00:05:38.629> there

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
on there

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.459 
on there
unlike<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.830> Han<00:05:39.949> Solo<00:05:39.979> on<00:05:40.870> so<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.199> don't<00:05:42.379> have

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
unlike the Han Solo on so you don't have

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.079 
unlike the Han Solo on so you don't have
to<00:05:42.589> worry<00:05:42.770> too<00:05:42.949> much<00:05:42.979> about<00:05:43.190> moving<00:05:43.729> his<00:05:43.849> arms

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
to worry too much about moving his arms

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.149 
to worry too much about moving his arms
around<00:05:44.210> plus<00:05:44.599> he's<00:05:44.750> got<00:05:44.930> nice<00:05:45.379> buggy<00:05:45.710> yes

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
around plus he's got nice buggy yes

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.459 
around plus he's got nice buggy yes
leaves<00:05:46.490> there<00:05:46.789> so<00:05:47.750> we<00:05:47.900> can<00:05:47.990> give<00:05:48.110> this<00:05:48.229> guy<00:05:48.440> a

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
leaves there so we can give this guy a

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.959 
leaves there so we can give this guy a
lightsaber<00:05:48.979> and<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:50.000> is<00:05:50.150> episode<00:05:50.479> one<00:05:50.990> one<00:05:51.229> I

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
lightsaber and this is episode one one I

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.399 
lightsaber and this is episode one one I
found<00:05:52.969> the<00:05:53.060> easiest<00:05:53.120> way<00:05:53.539> actually<00:05:53.900> is<00:05:54.229> to

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
found the easiest way actually is to

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.839 
found the easiest way actually is to
slightly<00:05:54.650> upwards<00:05:55.099> through<00:05:55.279> the<00:05:55.490> hand<00:05:55.639> that

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
slightly upwards through the hand that

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.300 
slightly upwards through the hand that
way<00:05:56.469> then<00:05:57.469> you're<00:05:57.650> not<00:05:57.740> putting<00:05:58.099> any<00:05:58.219> pressure

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
way then you're not putting any pressure

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.600 
way then you're not putting any pressure
on<00:05:59.289> but<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:00.349> don't<00:06:00.529> want<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.830> be<00:06:00.919> they'll<00:06:01.460> hold

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
on but you don't want to be they'll hold

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.809 
on but you don't want to be they'll hold
that<00:06:01.789> quite<00:06:02.029> nicely<00:06:02.060> in<00:06:02.509> there<00:06:03.460> so<00:06:04.460> that's<00:06:04.639> the

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:04.819 
that quite nicely in there so that's the

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.450 
that quite nicely in there so that's the
episode<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:05.419> look<00:06:05.659> but<00:06:06.620> as<00:06:06.740> he<00:06:06.860> comes<00:06:07.099> with<00:06:07.279> -

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
episode one look but as he comes with -

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.459 
episode one look but as he comes with -
I<00:06:07.759> think<00:06:08.120> it<00:06:08.330> won't<00:06:08.419> be<00:06:08.509> a<00:06:08.599> travesty<00:06:08.990> not<00:06:09.319> to

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
I think it won't be a travesty not to

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.100 
I think it won't be a travesty not to
use<00:06:09.620> both<00:06:09.860> of<00:06:09.889> them<00:06:10.159> at<00:06:10.279> the<00:06:10.339> same<00:06:10.370> time<00:06:11.110> so

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
use both of them at the same time so

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.619 
use both of them at the same time so
that's<00:06:12.289> giving<00:06:12.589> me<00:06:12.650> another<00:06:12.800> sober<00:06:13.339> so<00:06:14.240> if<00:06:14.479> I

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629 
that's giving me another sober so if I

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:15.969 
that's giving me another sober so if I
had<00:06:14.719> room<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:15.050> display<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.560> which<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.830> don't

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
had room to display and which I don't

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.860 
had room to display and which I don't
this<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.550> how<00:06:16.639> I'd<00:06:16.789> probably<00:06:17.000> do<00:06:17.360> it<00:06:17.509> with<00:06:17.659> the

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
this is how I'd probably do it with the

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.209 
this is how I'd probably do it with the
tea<00:06:18.020> light<00:06:18.229> service<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.830> just<00:06:18.979> looks<00:06:19.129> really

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
tea light service it just looks really

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.839 
tea light service it just looks really
really<00:06:19.819> cool<00:06:20.620> so<00:06:21.620> we<00:06:21.740> also<00:06:21.860> got<00:06:22.129> this<00:06:22.250> clock<00:06:22.639> to

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
really cool so we also got this clock to

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.730 
really cool so we also got this clock to
go<00:06:23.000> on<00:06:23.150> him<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.539> this<00:06:23.779> thing<00:06:23.990> is<00:06:24.139> huge<00:06:24.409> it's

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
go on him and this thing is huge it's

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.010 
go on him and this thing is huge it's
really<00:06:25.219> really<00:06:25.460> thick<00:06:25.729> material<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:26.930> he

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
really really thick material and he

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.959 
really really thick material and he
hangs<00:06:27.259> on<00:06:27.440> him<00:06:27.560> like<00:06:27.949> you<00:06:28.430> know<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:28.699> small

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
hangs on him like you know the small

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.610 
hangs on him like you know the small
figures<00:06:29.360> when<00:06:29.539> you<00:06:29.629> put<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.839> clock<00:06:30.110> on<00:06:30.259> them<00:06:30.469> and

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
figures when you put a clock on them and

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.040 
figures when you put a clock on them and
it<00:06:30.680> doesn't<00:06:30.949> quite<00:06:31.069> sit<00:06:31.400> right<00:06:31.639> it<00:06:32.330> just<00:06:32.659> it's

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
it doesn't quite sit right it just it's

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.620 
it doesn't quite sit right it just it's
like<00:06:33.139> that<00:06:33.440> to<00:06:33.649> me<00:06:33.770> this<00:06:34.009> hood<00:06:34.279> is<00:06:34.599> ridiculous

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
like that to me this hood is ridiculous

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.320 
like that to me this hood is ridiculous
it's<00:06:35.839> far

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
it's far

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.559 
it's far
far<00:06:36.539> too<00:06:36.750> big<00:06:37.220> he's<00:06:38.220> got<00:06:38.460> these<00:06:38.580> giant<00:06:39.090> slaves

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
far too big he's got these giant slaves

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.089 
far too big he's got these giant slaves
you<00:06:39.870> need<00:06:40.020> to<00:06:40.169> keep<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:40.470> light<00:06:40.620> servers<00:06:40.979> in

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
you need to keep the light servers in

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.649 
you need to keep the light servers in
his<00:06:41.189> hands<00:06:41.400> just<00:06:41.580> to<00:06:41.849> stop<00:06:42.060> that<00:06:42.210> flopping

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
his hands just to stop that flopping

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.589 
his hands just to stop that flopping
over<00:06:42.780> so<00:06:43.349> you<00:06:43.439> can't<00:06:43.680> see<00:06:43.860> anything<00:06:44.509> but<00:06:45.509> he

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
over so you can't see anything but he

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.629 
over so you can't see anything but he
looks<00:06:45.750> okay<00:06:46.199> like<00:06:46.439> that<00:06:46.680> well<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.460> problem

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
looks okay like that well the problem

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.909 
looks okay like that well the problem
starts<00:06:48.210> when<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:48.449> bring<00:06:48.599> up<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:48.870> hood<00:06:49.080> I<00:06:49.349> mean

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
starts when you bring up the hood I mean

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.499 
starts when you bring up the hood I mean
it's<00:06:50.069> just<00:06:50.180> too<00:06:51.180> big<00:06:52.909> so<00:06:53.909> that<00:06:54.060> is<00:06:54.210> such<00:06:54.479> a

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509
