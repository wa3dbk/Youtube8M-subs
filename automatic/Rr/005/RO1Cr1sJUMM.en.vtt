00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
pages are inked in wolman stain and then

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.900 
pages are inked in wolman stain and then
on<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.890> page<00:04:01.160> i<00:04:01.280> did<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> trifold<00:04:02.150> um<00:04:03.910> it's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
on this page i did the trifold um it's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.030 
on this page i did the trifold um it's
like<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> trifold<00:04:05.690> card<00:04:06.320> or<00:04:06.650> something<00:04:06.829> like

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
like a trifold card or something like

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.789 
like a trifold card or something like
that<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.120> tied<00:04:08.420> with<00:04:08.780> ribbon<00:04:09.560> and

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
that so I have it tied with ribbon and

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.640 
that so I have it tied with ribbon and
then<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.670> just<00:04:10.940> pull<00:04:11.570> these<00:04:11.750> two<00:04:11.989> corners<00:04:12.440> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
then you just pull these two corners and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.650 
then you just pull these two corners and
it<00:04:12.739> opens<00:04:13.040> up<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.370> cheek<00:04:13.549> in<00:04:13.700> journal<00:04:14.030> on<00:04:14.299> these

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
it opens up in cheek in journal on these

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.300 
it opens up in cheek in journal on these
corners<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.350> then<00:04:15.500> put<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.680> photo<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.190> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
corners and then put a photo in the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.159 
corners and then put a photo in the
middle<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.650> there's<00:04:19.549> that<00:04:19.910> on<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.810> side

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
middle and so there's that on this side

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.530 
middle and so there's that on this side
I<00:04:21.500> used<00:04:21.859> my<00:04:22.190> swirly<00:04:22.729> crust

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
I used my swirly crust

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.950 
I used my swirly crust
bigz<00:04:24.020> die<00:04:24.820> sizzix<00:04:25.820> die<00:04:26.000> for<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.300> big<00:04:26.420> shot<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
bigz die sizzix die for the big shot and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.150 
bigz die sizzix die for the big shot and
I<00:04:27.860> am<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:29.080> cut<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.170> out<00:04:30.260> with<00:04:30.530> lightweight

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
I am I cut it out with lightweight

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.870 
I am I cut it out with lightweight
chipboard<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:32.180> some<00:04:32.720> paper<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.820> then<00:04:34.820> I

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
chipboard and some paper and then I

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.760 
chipboard and some paper and then I
glued<00:04:35.180> them<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.080> then<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:36.260> isn't<00:04:36.500> glued

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
glued them on and then this isn't glued

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.960 
glued them on and then this isn't glued
on<00:04:36.950> all<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.190> way<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:37.820> pops<00:04:38.540> out<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.700> that

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
on all the way and this pops out so that

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.080 
on all the way and this pops out so that
um<00:04:41.360> she<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.560> put<00:04:42.770> her<00:04:42.800> photo<00:04:43.400> she'll<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:44.060> a

um she can put her photo she'll have a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.940 
um she can put her photo she'll have a
better<00:04:44.330> way<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.600> trace<00:04:44.930> out<00:04:45.140> her<00:04:45.350> photo<00:04:45.590> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
then um i covered the pattern paper on

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.520 
then um i covered the pattern paper on
the<00:04:49.190> back<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.850> she<00:04:50.000> can<00:04:50.180> either<00:04:50.510> leave<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.200> to

the back so she can either leave this to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.930 
the back so she can either leave this to
where<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:51.980> sits<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.340> there<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.700> she<00:04:52.820> can

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
there's not an easy way to get it out

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.270 
there's not an easy way to get it out
and<00:05:07.550> let's<00:05:07.700> share<00:05:07.820> fingernails<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:08.720> um

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and let's share fingernails so um

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.320 
and let's share fingernails so um
because<00:05:10.280> my<00:05:10.430> thought<00:05:10.670> was<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:10.880> she<00:05:11.210> would

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
because my thought was that she would

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.850 
because my thought was that she would
glue<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.660> down<00:05:11.690> once<00:05:12.080> she<00:05:12.260> had<00:05:12.380> her<00:05:12.530> photo<00:05:12.770> on

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
glue it down once she had her photo on

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.530 
glue it down once she had her photo on
but<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.190> wanted<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.670> to<00:05:13.790> be<00:05:13.880> easy<00:05:14.090> for<00:05:14.390> her<00:05:14.510> to

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
but I wanted it to be easy for her to

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.140 
but I wanted it to be easy for her to
cut<00:05:14.780> off<00:05:14.900> her<00:05:15.050> photo<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:15.920> there's<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
cut off her photo so there's that and

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.810 
cut off her photo so there's that and
then<00:05:17.750> by<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.050> time<00:05:18.230> were<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.460> other<00:05:19.580> side

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
then by that time were to the other side

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.220 
then by that time were to the other side
so<00:05:20.150> we<00:05:20.420> close<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.840> up<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.430> we<00:05:22.430> flip<00:05:22.670> it<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.900> now

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
so we close it up and we flip it so now

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.690 
so we close it up and we flip it so now
his<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.220> upside<00:05:25.820> down<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.540> we<00:05:26.750> flip<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.700> she

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
his is upside down so we flip it and she

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.170 
his is upside down so we flip it and she
is<00:05:29.660> Tiger<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.920> I<00:05:31.010> put<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> tiger<00:05:31.640> button<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.090> the

and if she doesn't want to have it to be

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.649 
and if she doesn't want to have it to be
able<00:07:32.409> to<00:07:32.559> pop<00:07:32.710> out<00:07:32.919> then<00:07:33.460> she<00:07:33.939> can<00:07:34.120> just<00:07:34.149> glue

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:34.659 
able to pop out then she can just glue

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.010 
able to pop out then she can just glue
it<00:07:34.689> down<00:07:34.949> so<00:07:36.240> there's<00:07:37.240> that<00:07:37.509> and<00:07:37.719> then<00:07:37.870> we're

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
it down so there's that and then we're

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.709 
it down so there's that and then we're
back<00:07:38.139> to<00:07:38.199> the<00:07:38.499> boys<00:07:38.680> side<00:07:38.889> so<00:07:39.309> I<00:07:39.550> had<00:07:40.449> a<00:07:40.479> lot<00:07:40.659> of

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:40.719 
back to the boys side so I had a lot of

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:42.959 
back to the boys side so I had a lot of
fun<00:07:41.020> with<00:07:41.229> the<00:07:41.409> fact<00:07:41.649> that<00:07:41.770> it<00:07:42.009> flips<00:07:42.370> I<00:07:42.669> think

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:42.969 
fun with the fact that it flips I think

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.420 
fun with the fact that it flips I think
it<00:07:43.149> adds<00:07:43.300> a<00:07:43.479> new<00:07:43.599> element<00:07:43.990> too<00:07:44.139> many<00:07:44.319> albums<00:07:44.740> so
