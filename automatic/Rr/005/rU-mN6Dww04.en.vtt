21st 2012 the world will end why it all
started<00:00:22.820> with<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.120> Mayan<00:00:23.480> long<00:00:23.690> term

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
started with the Mayan long term

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.730 
started with the Mayan long term
calendar<00:00:25.390> Mayans<00:00:26.390> exceeded<00:00:27.080> other<00:00:27.230> nations

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
calendar Mayans exceeded other nations

therefore<00:00:31.700> they<00:00:32.180> constructed<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.989> long<00:00:33.230> term

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
therefore they constructed a long term

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.860 
therefore they constructed a long term
calendar<00:00:34.219> which<00:00:34.370> ends<00:00:34.790> on<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.059> 21st<00:00:35.690> of

Albert<00:02:18.960> Einstein<00:02:19.560> agreed<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.220> polar<00:02:20.490> shift

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
Albert Einstein agreed that polar shift

Albert Einstein agreed that polar shift
is<00:02:21.090> something<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.960> happening<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.620> now

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
is something that is happening right now

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.760 
is something that is happening right now
it<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.000> possible<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.900> completed<00:02:25.470> shift

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
it is possible that the completed shift

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.990 
it is possible that the completed shift
may<00:02:26.040> end<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.660> 2012<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.170> because<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> lots

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
may end in 2012 and because of that lots
