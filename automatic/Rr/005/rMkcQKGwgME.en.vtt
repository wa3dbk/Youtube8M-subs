 Friday on the rise your point of salt 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.419

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.480
 our recipe is a Galician cod 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.420
 random grilled 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 the cod loins we do with the skin up 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.930
 and with a little bit of oil 2 it will take five six seven minutes 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 with the garlic, bring them in sheets 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 We were going to fry them with a little oil 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.350
 that are golden but watching well that we do not burn because if not 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.620
 they will tie them up a lot 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.450
 when they are ready and keep that golden color we will quote the pan of the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.470
 fire 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.110
 and it will be time to add the sweet paprika 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.979

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.440

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.250
