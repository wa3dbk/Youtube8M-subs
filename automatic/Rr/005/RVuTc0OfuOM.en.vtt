00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.969
 hello everyone my name is buns today i am 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.000
 would like to share with you a plugin 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.140
 Battlefield 4 I saw this in fact 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.529
 first time plugin called saints x 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.150
 he is not really in that field 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.390
 fourth but as it turned out 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.060
 it is possible to adapt it and there was one who 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.130
 This made a reference in the description of the video 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.590
 the essence of this plugin is that 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.800
 it changes color somewhat 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.400
 the temperature is colder more 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.080
 becomes blue and less yellow and 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480
 sharpen sharpness in the game 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.220
 increases 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.200
 Well, I would not say that right very much 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.780
 significantly but visually becomes 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:01.510
 more pleasantly the plugin turns on and off 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.970
 scroll lock keys right in the game i 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 Now I press the key 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.270
 had the opportunity to evaluate 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.280
 that is changing even though I think that you have on th 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.439
 tuba is still the quality of the picture is not 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.049
 allows you to see an enlarged 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.049
 sharpness nonetheless at least color 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.950
 temperature you should look like this 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:28.090
 looks like with a plugin like that without a plugin 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 like this with the plugin well, I now click 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 to be able to just see 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 what's happening 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:46.250
 subjectively really increases 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 I heard the harshness that this plugin 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.289
 turns off the fog on the locker actually 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.970
 No, I specifically loaded on locker 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.630
 watched turned off plug-in at that 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.840
 the moment when the fog covers me 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.319
 entrails 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.250
 the prison itself when I'm standing on a cliff so 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.170
 Here you can not see anything like with the plugin 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.190
 really can't see anything without 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 plug-in subjectively still play 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.349
 nicer 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.500
 it is with him because somehow 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.110
 better seen by my feelings here's how 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.910
 as if i was without glasses and girls 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.560
 I do not have one hundred percent vision, I sometimes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.239
 wear ears to watch a movie 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.799
 That's about as well as changing the picture with 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.170
 with my eyes but really everything 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.420
 thank you for your attention subscribe 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.420
