I earn welcome this is just a little
tutorial<00:00:10.500> showing<00:00:10.799> you<00:00:10.950> how<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.280> select<00:00:12.030> your

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
tutorial showing you how to select your

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.880 
tutorial showing you how to select your
stars<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:14.309> create<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.230> layer<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.560> just

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
stars and to create a layer with just

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.430 
stars and to create a layer with just
your<00:00:17.070> stars<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:18.960> go<00:00:19.110> ahead

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
your stars on it you can then go ahead

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.650 
your stars on it you can then go ahead
after<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> finish<00:00:20.250> doing<00:00:20.429> this<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
after you finish doing this and use this

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
after you finish doing this and use this
layer<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.859> change<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.730> saturation<00:00:24.089> of<00:00:24.689> your

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
layer to change the saturation of your

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.810 
layer to change the saturation of your
stars<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.589> brightness<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.160> color<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
stars the brightness the color of your

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.079 
stars the brightness the color of your
stars<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.509> also<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.759> later<00:00:29.939> on

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
stars and also a little bit later on

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.530 
stars and also a little bit later on
I'll<00:00:30.240> show<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.980> reduce<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.940> stars<00:00:33.240> as

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I'll show you how to reduce the stars as

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.819 
I'll show you how to reduce the stars as
well<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.140> now<00:00:34.260> we're<00:00:34.470> just<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.740> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
well but for now we're just going to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.430 
well but for now we're just going to
concentrate<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.820> selecting<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> stars<00:00:37.199> in

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
concentrate on selecting the stars in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.420 
concentrate on selecting the stars in
the<00:00:37.559> star<00:00:37.800> field<00:00:38.329> without<00:00:39.329> selecting<00:00:40.430> other

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the star field without selecting other

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.189 
the star field without selecting other
things<00:00:41.789> like<00:00:41.940> galaxies<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> nebulae<00:00:42.960> which

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
things like galaxies and nebulae which

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.319 
things like galaxies and nebulae which
is<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.469> I've<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> blob

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
is what I've got down here so the blob

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.529 
is what I've got down here so the blob
it's<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> Crab<00:00:46.079> Nebula<00:00:47.000> okay<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.059> let's<00:00:48.359> make

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it's the Crab Nebula okay so let's make

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's the Crab Nebula okay so let's make
a<00:00:48.600> start<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.699> layers<00:00:51.980> panel

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
a start first of all in the layers panel

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
a start first of all in the layers panel
over<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:54.000> our<00:00:54.210> image<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.100> it's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
over here we have our image and it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
over here we have our image and it's
just<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> background<00:00:57.140> layer<00:00:58.140> our

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just there as a background layer our

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680 
just there as a background layer our
background<00:00:58.920> layer<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.789> we're<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
background layer so we're gonna do is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.209 
background layer so we're gonna do is
I'm<00:01:00.809> gonna<00:01:00.899> click<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.679> background<00:01:01.890> layer

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
I'm gonna click on the background layer

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.119 
I'm gonna click on the background layer
drag<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:03.359> onto<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.589> icon<00:01:04.800> next

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
drag it down onto this little icon next

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.960 
drag it down onto this little icon next
to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> rubbish<00:01:05.820> bin<00:01:06.150> looks<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.230> a<00:01:07.970> folded

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
to the rubbish bin looks like a folded

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
to the rubbish bin looks like a folded
piece<00:01:09.120> of<00:01:09.300> paper<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:09.990> where<00:01:10.380> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
piece of paper and that's where we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
piece of paper and that's where we
create<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.100> new<00:01:11.310> layer<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.270> we'll<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.510> drag

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
create our new layer so we'll just drag

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
create our new layer so we'll just drag
it<00:01:12.960> onto<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.920> will<00:01:14.040> create<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> new

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it onto there and it will create a new

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.530 
it onto there and it will create a new
layer<00:01:15.660> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> layers<00:01:16.440> palette<00:01:17.510> which<00:01:18.510> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
layer in the layers palette which is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.290 
layer in the layers palette which is
just<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.830> default<00:01:19.890> called<00:01:20.490> background<00:01:21.060> copy

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
just by default called background copy

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.550 
just by default called background copy
so<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.700> selected<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.140> wanted

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so with this one now selected you wanted

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
so with this one now selected you wanted
us<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.100> stop<00:01:26.610> looking<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.090> something<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.600> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
us to stop looking at something you just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.130 
us to stop looking at something you just
click<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.410> little<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:30.330> click<00:01:30.870> it<00:01:30.990> back

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
click on the little I and click it back

click on the little I and click it back
interview<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.510> a<00:01:33.540> background<00:01:34.050> copy

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
interview it so with a background copy

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
interview it so with a background copy
this<00:01:34.950> new<00:01:35.220> duplicate<00:01:35.730> layer<00:01:35.940> selected<00:01:36.540> we're

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this new duplicate layer selected we're

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.940 
this new duplicate layer selected we're
now<00:01:36.870> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.370> select<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.850> stars<00:01:39.950> bit

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
now going to select the stars bit

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.640 
now going to select the stars bit
difficult<00:01:41.370> because<00:01:41.550> we've<00:01:41.850> got<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.650> Crab

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
difficult because we've got this Crab

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.820 
difficult because we've got this Crab
Nebula<00:01:44.040> sitting<00:01:44.550> down<00:01:44.730> there<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.710> don't

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
Nebula sitting down there and we don't

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410 
Nebula sitting down there and we don't
want<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> stars

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
want that we only want the stars

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
want that we only want the stars
so<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.930> neat<00:01:49.830> way<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> getting<00:01:50.520> rid<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
so this is a neat way of getting rid of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
so this is a neat way of getting rid of
everything<00:01:51.660> except<00:01:52.410> just<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.650> stars<00:01:53.240> first

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
everything except just the stars first

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.350 
everything except just the stars first
of<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:54.780> need<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> filter<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.400> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of all you need to go to filter and you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560 
of all you need to go to filter and you
need<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.720> scroll<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.770> noise<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.670> go<00:02:00.510> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
need to scroll down to noise and go to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.320 
need to scroll down to noise and go to
dust<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> scratches<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.400> select<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:05.330> okay

we look lie and we zoom in you can see
that<00:07:07.139> what<00:07:07.290> we've<00:07:07.440> got<00:07:07.650> there<00:07:07.830> is<00:07:07.979> just<00:07:08.760> our

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
that what we've got there is just our

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.240 
that what we've got there is just our
stars<00:07:10.130> that<00:07:11.130> is<00:07:11.720> exactly<00:07:12.720> what<00:07:12.990> we<00:07:13.139> want<00:07:13.350> we're

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
stars that is exactly what we want we're

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.210 
stars that is exactly what we want we're
gonna<00:07:14.340> leave<00:07:14.669> it<00:07:14.790> at<00:07:14.910> that<00:07:14.940> for<00:07:15.300> this<00:07:15.419> tutorial

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
gonna leave it at that for this tutorial

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.279 
gonna leave it at that for this tutorial
and<00:07:17.220> in<00:07:17.430> the<00:07:17.520> next<00:07:17.820> one<00:07:18.000> we're<00:07:18.479> going<00:07:18.750> to<00:07:18.960> work

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289 
and in the next one we're going to work

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.529 
and in the next one we're going to work
further<00:07:19.590> on<00:07:19.800> these<00:07:20.100> stars<00:07:20.400> by<00:07:20.760> reducing<00:07:21.360> them

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
further on these stars by reducing them

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.950 
further on these stars by reducing them
and<00:07:22.490> also<00:07:23.490> adding<00:07:23.910> a<00:07:24.120> little<00:07:24.449> bit<00:07:24.570> of<00:07:24.660> color

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
and also adding a little bit of color

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.300 
and also adding a little bit of color
and<00:07:26.030> reducing<00:07:27.260> perhaps<00:07:28.260> the<00:07:28.410> saturation<00:07:29.130> just

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
and reducing perhaps the saturation just

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.400 
and reducing perhaps the saturation just
a<00:07:29.699> few<00:07:29.880> general<00:07:30.240> things<00:07:30.539> to<00:07:30.780> improve<00:07:31.139> it<00:07:31.289> but

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
a few general things to improve it but

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.510 
a few general things to improve it but
that's<00:07:31.620> how<00:07:31.830> you<00:07:31.940> select<00:07:32.940> your<00:07:33.300> stars<00:07:33.600> and

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
that's how you select your stars and

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.490 
that's how you select your stars and
provide<00:07:35.520> yourself<00:07:35.970> with<00:07:36.060> a<00:07:36.240> nice<00:07:36.449> layer<00:07:37.199> with

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
provide yourself with a nice layer with

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.860 
provide yourself with a nice layer with
just<00:07:37.800> your<00:07:37.979> stars<00:07:38.280> in<00:07:38.550> it<00:07:38.669> so<00:07:39.330> that<00:07:39.539> you<00:07:39.660> can

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
just your stars in it so that you can

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.289 
just your stars in it so that you can
work<00:07:40.050> with
