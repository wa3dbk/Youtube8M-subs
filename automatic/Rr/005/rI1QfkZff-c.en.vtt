you would normally put your seats in

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.869 
you would normally put your seats in

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
here but let's go ahead and just grab

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.029 
here but let's go ahead and just grab
ourselves<00:04:47.270> some<00:04:47.840> seeds<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:48.440> test<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:48.889> out

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
ourselves some seeds and test this out

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.550 
ourselves some seeds and test this out
so<00:04:49.340> these<00:04:49.940> dispensers<00:04:50.599> are<00:04:50.750> filled<00:04:51.110> with<00:04:51.229> bone

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
so these dispensers are filled with bone

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860 
so these dispensers are filled with bone
meal<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.069> flicking<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:52.759> button<00:04:53.120> initiates

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
meal and flicking this button initiates

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.990 
meal and flicking this button initiates
a<00:04:54.080> rapid<00:04:54.590> redstone<00:04:55.069> signal<00:04:55.340> which<00:04:55.669> basically

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
a rapid redstone signal which basically

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.820 
a rapid redstone signal which basically
makes<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.539> an<00:04:56.629> automatic<00:04:56.930> machine<00:04:57.199> gun<00:04:57.620> and

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
makes it an automatic machine gun and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.189 
makes it an automatic machine gun and
then<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:59.120> will<00:04:59.270> see<00:04:59.509> what<00:04:59.629> happens<00:04:59.659> okay<00:05:00.050> so

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
then you will see what happens okay so

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:00.999 
then you will see what happens okay so
it's<00:05:00.349> go<00:05:00.409> ahead<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.620> just<00:05:00.710> hit<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.860> button

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
it's go ahead and just hit that button

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.100 
it's go ahead and just hit that button
and<00:05:01.370> then<00:05:01.940> now<00:05:02.120> what<00:05:02.419> we<00:05:02.539> basically<00:05:02.690> do<00:05:03.080> is

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
and then now what we basically do is

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.809 
and then now what we basically do is
just<00:05:03.319> put<00:05:03.590> down<00:05:03.740> our<00:05:04.039> wheat<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.550> then<00:05:04.699> it

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
just put down our wheat and then it

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.610 
just put down our wheat and then it
grows<00:05:05.090> instantly<00:05:05.780> check<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.139> out<00:05:06.259> and<00:05:06.440> then<00:05:06.530> we

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
grows instantly check it out and then we

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.629 
grows instantly check it out and then we
hit<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:06.800> button<00:05:07.009> and<00:05:07.219> then<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.460> breaks

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
hit this button and then it breaks

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.339 
hit this button and then it breaks

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
let's just go back up here and one thing

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.640 
let's just go back up here and one thing
to<00:06:29.570> mention<00:06:29.690> is<00:06:29.930> that<00:06:30.050> for<00:06:30.230> some<00:06:30.350> reason<00:06:30.560> I'm

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
to mention is that for some reason I'm

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.200 
to mention is that for some reason I'm
getting<00:06:30.770> glitter<00:06:31.160> over<00:06:31.250> here<00:06:31.520> where<00:06:32.000> it

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
getting glitter over here where it

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.420 
getting glitter over here where it
basically<00:06:32.720> does<00:06:33.110> not<00:06:33.290> pull<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:33.860> block<00:06:34.160> down

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
basically does not pull this block down

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.710 
basically does not pull this block down
so<00:06:34.790> it's<00:06:34.910> normally<00:06:35.180> supposed<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.419> be<00:06:35.510> like

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
so it's normally supposed to be like

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.659 
so it's normally supposed to be like
that<00:06:35.840> anyway<00:06:36.740> so<00:06:36.950> once<00:06:37.160> we<00:06:37.220> got<00:06:37.310> back<00:06:37.370> to<00:06:37.610> the

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
that anyway so once we got back to the

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:38.860 
that anyway so once we got back to the

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
now I did not build a map of course you

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.820 
now I did not build a map of course you
guys<00:06:49.760> know<00:06:49.820> I<00:06:50.060> just<00:06:50.419> showcase<00:06:50.840> things<00:06:51.169> but

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
guys know I just showcase things but

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.550 
guys know I just showcase things but
this<00:06:52.280> is<00:06:52.580> basically<00:06:53.120> an<00:06:53.300> MC<00:06:53.750> edit<00:06:54.110> version<00:06:54.320> I

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
this is basically an MC edit version I

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.230 
this is basically an MC edit version I
guess<00:06:54.590> of<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:55.340> house<00:06:55.520> that's<00:06:55.820> kind<00:06:55.970> of<00:06:56.000> raised

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
guess of the house that's kind of raised

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.090 
guess of the house that's kind of raised
above<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.630> ground<00:06:56.900> and<00:06:57.260> this<00:06:57.740> is<00:06:57.889> where<00:06:58.070> our

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
above the ground and this is where our

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.430 
above the ground and this is where our
frog<00:06:58.550> would<00:06:58.760> be<00:06:58.910> as<00:06:59.270> well<00:06:59.600> as<00:06:59.630> you<00:07:00.169> know<00:07:00.260> where

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
frog would be as well as you know where

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.810 
frog would be as well as you know where
to<00:07:00.530> staircase<00:07:00.919> and<00:07:01.070> whatnot<00:07:01.370> would<00:07:01.490> be<00:07:01.639> so

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
to staircase and whatnot would be so

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.420 
to staircase and whatnot would be so
maybe<00:07:02.270> you<00:07:02.750> guys<00:07:02.900> can<00:07:03.110> make<00:07:03.350> more<00:07:03.830> sense<00:07:04.220> of

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
maybe you guys can make more sense of

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.400 
maybe you guys can make more sense of
this<00:07:04.580> than<00:07:04.790> me<00:07:04.970> I've<00:07:05.210> really<00:07:05.479> dabbled<00:07:06.350> with
