00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I'll bet that with you too 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.710
 forbidden books in the shelf have which 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.710
 I show you 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.680
 In 1931, for example, Alice was named Alice in China 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.390
 banned in wonderland with the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.880
 reason that animals are not human 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 language should speak 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.260
 I would say dark times for fables 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
 dark times and let's face it 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 the only thing at alice in wonderland 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 heard is forbidden the psychedelic 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 disney movie from 1951 that made me so 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.730
 I was traumatized as a child still 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 today nightmares of tridelity and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 again, uncle toms kevin was not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
 just forbidden time in it actually 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 still slavery existed in the us 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.399
 of course, the plantation owners 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 a say and those were the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.329
 opinion this book does not belong 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.030
 publicly and, interestingly, has 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.980
 russia's book also prohibited from 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 religious views and because they are the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 opinion was that the equality 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.820
 the one aspired to in this book is one 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.320
 bad idea is 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.619
 1980 was in a school district in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.030
 New York actually wore in word or 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 in German who disturbs the nightingale 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 banned with the justification that it is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.659
 is a dirty trasch book and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 even in 1996 the book was still banned 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.259
 in texas on the grounds that it 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 again the views and values ​​of 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.390
 community would be and the magician of 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 oz a beautiful children's book 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 Of course not only for children is beautiful 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.780
 was actually banned in the us 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.119
 because it is against existing women's roles 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.320
 speaks to a strong woman as 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 Heroes and 1957 in Detroit has the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 Head of the library actually said 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 that this book is from the library 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.590
 has to be taken because it is negative 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.180
 must promote and give children a wrong 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.979
 weltbild are just continuing this means about 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.579
 You can not stay in a tornado yet 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.579
 leave 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 my worldview is destroyed 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.020
 it's not great to see that books 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 which we celebrate today as a classic 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.280
 actually forbidden and outlawed earlier 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 I think that's a great one 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.930
 exciting development and something was that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.700
 you should think about it you can me 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.200
 if you betray that you will find that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.510
 no books at all 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.940
 belong and if so which and if 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.560
 not why do not tell me that everything is in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.120
 the comments we'll see you next 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.140
