00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.460 
montages lately people are like oh it's
over<00:03:42.280> edited<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.790> stuff<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.750> knew<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.049> he

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
over edited and stuff so I knew that he

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.650 
over edited and stuff so I knew that he
would<00:03:44.709> do<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.130> nice<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.730> simple<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.329> he

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
would do it like nice and simple and he

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.740 
would do it like nice and simple and he
did<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> mean<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.829> looked<00:03:48.040> fine<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> me<00:03:48.609> but

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
did I mean it looked fine to me but

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.030 
did I mean it looked fine to me but
guess<00:03:49.900> other<00:03:50.110> people<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.650> didn't<00:03:50.890> agree

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
guess other people just didn't agree

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.680 
guess other people just didn't agree
with<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.850> lot<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.150> people<00:03:52.240> like<00:03:52.510> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
with it but a lot of people like the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.690 
with it but a lot of people like the
gameplay<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.320> stuff<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.800> mean<00:03:54.160> that's<00:03:54.430> just

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
gameplay and stuff I mean that's just

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.760 
gameplay and stuff I mean that's just
people's<00:03:55.180> opinions<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.900> don't<00:03:56.200> really<00:03:56.380> care

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
people's opinions I don't really care

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.250 
people's opinions I don't really care
what<00:03:57.130> people<00:03:57.730> think<00:03:57.880> it's<00:03:58.330> what<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.600> think<00:03:58.720> and

just wondering what your guys opinion on

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.420 
just wondering what your guys opinion on
that<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.200> from<00:04:44.770> what<00:04:44.890> I've<00:04:45.040> been<00:04:45.070> hearing

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that is and from what I've been hearing

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.090 
that is and from what I've been hearing
and<00:04:46.060> seeing<00:04:46.330> about<00:04:46.780> modern<00:04:47.380> warfare<00:04:47.500> 3<00:04:47.680> it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
and seeing about modern warfare 3 it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.430 
and seeing about modern warfare 3 it
looks<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.430> lot<00:04:48.700> like<00:04:49.090> fun<00:04:49.900> with<00:04:50.110> her<00:04:50.260> too

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
looks a lot like fun with her too

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.170 
looks a lot like fun with her too
apparently<00:04:51.250> plays<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:51.940> modern

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
apparently plays just like modern

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.180 
apparently plays just like modern
warfare<00:04:52.390> 2<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:52.870> hopefully<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.320> has<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.650> fast

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
warfare 2 so hopefully it has that fast

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.550 
warfare 2 so hopefully it has that fast
paced<00:04:54.550> action<00:04:54.820> packed<00:04:55.390> gaming<00:04:56.080> that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
paced action packed gaming that

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.010 
paced action packed gaming that
blackouts<00:04:57.520> lacked<00:04:57.910> I'm<00:04:58.510> going<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.780> have<00:04:58.990> to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
blackouts lacked I'm going to have to

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.620 
blackouts lacked I'm going to have to
say<00:04:59.350> black<00:04:59.950> ops<00:05:00.130> really<00:05:00.370> did<00:05:00.550> like<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:01.090> so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
say black ops really did like that so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.820 
say black ops really did like that so
I'm<00:05:01.720> looking<00:05:01.840> forward<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.290> more<00:05:02.470> fast-paced

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
I'm looking forward to more fast-paced

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.000 
I'm looking forward to more fast-paced
things<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.640> I<00:05:04.390> liked<00:05:04.780> what<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.440> sniper

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
things and I liked what the sniper

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.670 
things and I liked what the sniper
rifles<00:05:06.460> look<00:05:06.669> like<00:05:07.169> hopefully<00:05:08.169> they'll<00:05:08.500> have

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
rifles look like hopefully they'll have

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.530 
rifles look like hopefully they'll have
less<00:05:08.919> hit<00:05:09.160> markers<00:05:09.550> because<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:09.970> damage<00:05:10.360> may

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
less hit markers because the damage may

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.600 
less hit markers because the damage may
be<00:05:10.600> increased<00:05:11.320> or<00:05:11.500> something<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.070> form<00:05:12.310> so

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
be increased or something to form so

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.730 
be increased or something to form so
hopefully<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.510> snipers<00:05:13.960> are<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:14.290> one<00:05:14.620> or

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
hopefully the snipers are just one or

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.800 
hopefully the snipers are just one or
not<00:05:14.950> really<00:05:15.370> well<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.880> from<00:05:16.510> what<00:05:16.630> I've<00:05:16.780> seen

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
not really well and from what I've seen

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.990 
not really well and from what I've seen
so<00:05:17.050> far<00:05:17.229> it<00:05:17.620> looks<00:05:17.710> like<00:05:18.010> they<00:05:18.250> do<00:05:18.550> work<00:05:18.820> out

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
so far it looks like they do work out

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.490 
so far it looks like they do work out
really<00:05:19.240> well<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.630> think<00:05:19.780> there's<00:05:20.050> two<00:05:20.229> bolt

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
really well I think there's two bolt

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.020 
really well I think there's two bolt
action<00:05:20.950> which<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.280> your<00:05:21.400> heart<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:21.790> then<00:05:21.910> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
action which of your heart and then the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.760 
action which of your heart and then the
rest<00:05:22.180> are<00:05:22.360> semi<00:05:22.660> automatics<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:23.350> not<00:05:23.530> talk

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
rest are semi automatics and not talk

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.159 
rest are semi automatics and not talk
can<00:05:24.310> we<00:05:24.340> really<00:05:24.910> look<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.090> but<00:05:25.510> i'm<00:05:25.990> pretty

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
can we really look that but i'm pretty

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.500 
can we really look that but i'm pretty
sure<00:05:26.290> their<00:05:26.530> default<00:05:26.979> actions<00:05:27.490> i<00:05:27.790> was<00:05:28.240> maybe

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
sure their default actions i was maybe

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.270 
sure their default actions i was maybe
expecting<00:05:29.110> like<00:05:29.229> one<00:05:29.470> or<00:05:29.590> two<00:05:29.770> more<00:05:29.979> bolt

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
expecting like one or two more bolt

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.850 
expecting like one or two more bolt
actions<00:05:30.790> but<00:05:31.030> that's<00:05:31.600> fine<00:05:31.840> i<00:05:31.900> mean<00:05:32.410> they

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
actions but that's fine i mean they

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.520 
actions but that's fine i mean they
always<00:05:33.070> have<00:05:33.400> put<00:05:33.640> more<00:05:34.410> semi-automatic<00:05:35.410> than

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
always have put more semi-automatic than

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.370 
always have put more semi-automatic than
protections<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.430> that's<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.479> them<00:05:37.630> but

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
protections and that's up to them but

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.480 
protections and that's up to them but
