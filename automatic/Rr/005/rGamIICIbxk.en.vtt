00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
Advantech I chopped off what I could

Advantech I chopped off what I could
chop<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> Sun<00:01:50.880> came<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
chop off and when the Sun came out it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.139 
chop off and when the Sun came out it
dried<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.890> came<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.159> perfect<00:01:53.790> no

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
dried up and it came back perfect no

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
time that range we would have problems

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.030 
time that range we would have problems
with<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> delaminating<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.229> after<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
with it delaminating so after the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.859 
with it delaminating so after the
plywood<00:02:05.399> goes<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.850> doramin<00:02:06.329> eights<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> got

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
plywood goes on doramin eights you got

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.980 
plywood goes on doramin eights you got
to<00:02:06.960> pull<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.560> new<00:02:07.740> plywood<00:02:07.979> on

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
to pull it off but new plywood on

to pull it off but new plywood on
always<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.770> problem<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.520> trying<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.120> paid

always a problem with trying to get paid
for<00:02:11.420> doing<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.230> after<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> fact<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.940> first

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
for doing that after the fact my first

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.210 
for doing that after the fact my first
experience<00:02:14.780> with<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.080> was<00:02:15.260> Hancock<00:02:15.860> lumber

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
experience with it was Hancock lumber

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.910 
experience with it was Hancock lumber
came<00:02:16.430> out<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.180> he<00:02:17.930> knew<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.290> problems<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.800> I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
came out and he knew the problems that I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.590 
came out and he knew the problems that I
had<00:02:19.190> been<00:02:19.340> having<00:02:19.670> because<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.910> did<00:02:20.090> chewing<00:02:20.450> on

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
had been having because I did chewing on

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.300 
had been having because I did chewing on
his<00:02:20.750> ear<00:02:20.960> for<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> while<00:02:21.440> about<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:22.010> getting

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
his ear for a while about not getting

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.640 
his ear for a while about not getting
paid<00:02:22.490> for<00:02:22.550> doing<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.120> extra<00:02:23.480> work<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.500> he

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
paid for doing the extra work so he

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.190 
paid for doing the extra work so he
recommended<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.400> van<00:02:25.580> tack<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.300> through<00:02:27.050> that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
recommended in van tack and through that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.500 
recommended in van tack and through that
project<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.860> ranged<00:02:28.310> several<00:02:28.670> times<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
project it ranged several times and I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.870 
project it ranged several times and I
took<00:02:29.570> great<00:02:29.930> notice<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.130> product<00:02:31.820> just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
took great notice that the product just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.570 
took great notice that the product just
wasn't<00:02:32.330> absorbing<00:02:33.020> water<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:33.920> plywood<00:02:34.160> do

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
wasn't absorbing water like plywood do

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.510 
wasn't absorbing water like plywood do
ya<00:02:35.090> from<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.810> first<00:02:36.050> project<00:02:36.260> I'm<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.770> sold

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
ya from that first project I'm a sold

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760 
ya from that first project I'm a sold
I<00:02:37.550> changed<00:02:38.480> over<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.110> because<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.740> the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
I changed over to it because I like the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.520 
I changed over to it because I like the
way<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.190> lays<00:02:40.760> down<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.330> interlocked<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
way it lays down and interlocked on the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.290 
way it lays down and interlocked on the
floors<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.460> that's<00:02:43.580> my<00:02:43.850> key<00:02:44.150> with

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
floors I you know that's my key with

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.330 
floors I you know that's my key with
them<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.720> lot<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.960> tile<00:02:45.260> work<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.190> it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
them I do a lot of tile work so I use it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.310 
them I do a lot of tile work so I use it
on<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.640> too<00:02:46.850> which<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.240> very<00:02:47.840> good<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.290> know

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
on that too which is very good you know

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320 
on that too which is very good you know
it's<00:02:48.530> strong<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.880> lot<00:02:50.060> better<00:02:50.240> than

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
it's strong it's a lot better than

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.360 
it's strong it's a lot better than
plywood<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:51.020> find<00:02:51.500> if<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.860> do<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> right<00:02:52.340> job

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
plywood I find if you do the right job

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.040 
plywood I find if you do the right job
from<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.000> side<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.390> don't<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.660> any<00:02:53.810> call

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
from the side you don't have any call

backs if you got the right thickness you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.790 
backs if you got the right thickness you
glue<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.570> down<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.750> do<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.770> no

glue it down and do it right you have no
call<00:02:58.190> back<00:02:58.400> I've<00:02:59.030> had<00:02:59.240> zero<00:02:59.420> call<00:02:59.960> back<00:03:00.170> it

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
call back I've had zero call back it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.620 
call back I've had zero call back it
doesn't<00:03:01.010> move<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.520> doesn't<00:03:01.910> soak<00:03:02.270> up<00:03:02.450> moisture

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
doesn't move it doesn't soak up moisture

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.100 
doesn't move it doesn't soak up moisture
there's<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.560> there's<00:03:04.370> no<00:03:04.460> de<00:03:04.730> laminating<00:03:05.330> it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
there's just there's no de laminating it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.530 
there's just there's no de laminating it
basically<00:03:06.470> isn't<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> background<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.240> an

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
basically isn't a background it is an

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.080 
basically isn't a background it is an
integral<00:03:08.900> layer<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.190> structure<00:03:10.700> but

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
integral layer of the structure but

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.480 
integral layer of the structure but
because<00:03:11.420> it's<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:11.840> strong<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.830> allows<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.460> to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
because it's so strong it allows you to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.620 
because it's so strong it allows you to
pull<00:03:13.880> things<00:03:14.210> to<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.590> regard<00:03:15.770> it
