start off with a brush a little bit

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.930 
start off with a brush a little bit
smaller<00:00:49.730> than<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.670> size<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.850> the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.799 
cheek that you want to you want to be
making<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.909> start<00:00:56.239> off<00:00:56.329> with<00:00:56.359> your<00:00:56.629> brush

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
making and you start off with your brush

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.709 
making and you start off with your brush
bra<00:00:57.140> dry<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.059> take<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.239> little<00:00:59.449> bit<00:00:59.659> of

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
bra dry and just take a little bit of

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.210 
bra dry and just take a little bit of
the<00:00:59.929> paint<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:02.440> just<00:01:03.440> kind<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.679> smear<00:01:04.100> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
the paint and I just kind of smear it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.960 
the paint and I just kind of smear it
around<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:06.140> my<00:01:06.350> work<00:01:06.530> surface<00:01:06.770> until<00:01:07.610> my<00:01:07.760> brush

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
around on my work surface until my brush

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.100 
around on my work surface until my brush
is<00:01:08.210> pretty<00:01:08.510> dry<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.590> can<00:01:09.740> also<00:01:09.890> use<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:11.110> paper

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
is pretty dry you can also use a paper

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.380 
is pretty dry you can also use a paper
towel<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.540> really<00:01:14.930> don't<00:01:15.170> want<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.860> have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
towel so you really don't want to have

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.560 
towel so you really don't want to have
very<00:01:17.390> much<00:01:17.660> paint<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.200> your<00:01:18.320> brush<00:01:18.380> so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
very much paint on your brush so

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.210 
very much paint on your brush so
essentially<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.050> about<00:01:24.440> as<00:01:24.620> dry<00:01:24.860> as<00:01:24.920> you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
essentially this is about as dry as you

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.020 
essentially this is about as dry as you
want<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.670> your<00:01:25.880> brush<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
want to have your brush so that the the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.550 
want to have your brush so that the the
paint<00:01:29.300> effect<00:01:29.690> that<00:01:29.870> you're<00:01:30.050> that<00:01:30.440> you're

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
paint effect that you're that you're

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.890 
paint effect that you're that you're
that<00:01:30.920> you're<00:01:31.010> blushing<00:01:31.250> on<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:32.540> going<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.780> be

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
that you're blushing on is going to be

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.670 
that you're blushing on is going to be
very<00:01:33.320> very<00:01:35.530> very<00:01:36.530> light<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.160> very<00:01:37.310> subtle<00:01:37.970> so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
very very very light and very subtle so

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
once you have a good dry brush you take

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.600 
once you have a good dry brush you take

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
off of my my brush trying to make sure

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.670 
off of my my brush trying to make sure
that<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.360> don't<00:04:24.449> smear<00:04:24.900> too<00:04:25.080> much<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680

amigurumi

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:53.379 

right

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.070 

and<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.139> makes<00:04:54.409> for<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.740> much<00:04:55.189> less<00:04:55.550> notable

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and this makes for a much less notable

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.129 
and this makes for a much less notable
noticeable<00:04:57.080> effect<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.729> you<00:04:59.360> kind<00:04:59.659> of<00:04:59.750> do<00:04:59.930> have

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
noticeable effect so you kind of do have

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:10.330 
noticeable effect so you kind of do have
to<00:05:00.379> use<00:05:01.210> more<00:05:02.210> layers

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.910 

and<00:05:10.940> apply<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.720> little<00:05:11.930> bit<00:05:12.139> darker<00:05:12.410> a

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
and apply it a little bit darker a

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.590 
and apply it a little bit darker a
little<00:05:13.190> bit<00:05:13.520> more<00:05:13.760> thoroughly<00:05:14.030> than<00:05:14.389> you

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
little bit more thoroughly than you

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.790 
little bit more thoroughly than you
would<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.960> just<00:05:18.170> kind<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.410> have<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.590> be

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
would you just kind of have to be

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.000 
would you just kind of have to be
careful<00:05:19.220> as<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:19.490> go<00:05:19.520> because<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.150> can't<00:05:21.010> if

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
careful as you go because you can't if

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:38.580 
careful as you go because you can't if
you<00:05:22.070> put<00:05:22.460> too<00:05:22.730> much<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.300> can't<00:05:23.510> remove<00:05:23.900> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.510 

you<00:05:39.220> can<00:05:39.400> kind<00:05:39.670> of<00:05:39.760> count<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.240> stitches<00:05:41.520> to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
you can kind of count the stitches to

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.870 
you can kind of count the stitches to
make<00:05:42.850> sure<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:44.790> are<00:05:45.790> sort<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:47.820> at<00:05:48.820> the
