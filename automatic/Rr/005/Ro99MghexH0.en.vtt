our wrath by one bar whereas it takes

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
our wrath by one bar whereas it takes
four<00:00:49.379> shards<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.910> doesn't

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
four shards to do that this just doesn't

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
four shards to do that this just doesn't
one-shot<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> already<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.980> say<00:00:53.430> two

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
one-shot and if you already have say two

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
one-shot and if you already have say two
shards<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.260> gonna<00:00:55.410> discard<00:00:56.129> those

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
shards it's not just gonna discard those

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.880 
shards it's not just gonna discard those
shards<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.329> gonna<00:00:57.420> giving<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
shards it's actually gonna giving you

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.560 
shards it's actually gonna giving you
all<00:00:58.890> four<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.699> pretty<00:01:00.239> much<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.390> like

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
all four it's pretty much just like

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
all four it's pretty much just like
giving<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> four<00:01:01.230> shards

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
giving you four shards

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.530 
giving you four shards
so<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.340> you<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.580> two<00:01:04.790> charts<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.390> get<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
so if you have two charts and you get a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.090 
so if you have two charts and you get a
full<00:01:05.780> one<00:01:05.960> you'll<00:01:06.170> still<00:01:06.380> have<00:01:06.500> two<00:01:06.680> shards

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
full one you'll still have two shards

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.390 
full one you'll still have two shards
you'll<00:01:07.280> just<00:01:07.460> have<00:01:07.580> an<00:01:07.700> extra<00:01:07.880> rattle<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:09.500> do

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you'll just have an extra rattle so do

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.280 
you'll just have an extra rattle so do
your<00:01:10.550> best<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.790> hit<00:01:11.030> him<00:01:11.240> before<00:01:11.480> you<00:01:11.870> kind<00:01:12.170> of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
your best to hit him before you kind of

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:22.990 
your best to hit him before you kind of

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.610 

then<00:01:23.540> we're<00:01:23.630> gonna<00:01:23.750> head<00:01:23.930> back<00:01:24.110> down<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.500> hole

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
then we're gonna head back down the hole

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.820 
then we're gonna head back down the hole
