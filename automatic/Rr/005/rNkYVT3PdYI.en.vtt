00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
yeah it's apparently from what you know

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
yeah it's apparently from what you know
the<00:01:44.939> home<00:01:45.119> page<00:01:45.299> says<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.990> supposed<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.350> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the home page says it's supposed to be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.819 
the home page says it's supposed to be
10<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> 20<00:01:47.460> minute<00:01:47.729> short<00:01:48.119> film<00:01:48.829> something

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
10 to 20 minute short film something

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.609 
10 to 20 minute short film something
sort<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.049> guess<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.409> good

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
sort of like that which I guess is good

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
sort of like that which I guess is good
because<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.490> didn't<00:01:53.729> go<00:01:53.970> ahead<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.630> know

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because they didn't go ahead you know

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.639 
because they didn't go ahead you know
they<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:54.869> want<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.259> ahead<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> make

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
they don't want to go ahead and make

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.580 
they don't want to go ahead and make
like<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> two-hour<00:01:56.520> movie<00:01:56.820> about<00:01:57.590> everybody's
