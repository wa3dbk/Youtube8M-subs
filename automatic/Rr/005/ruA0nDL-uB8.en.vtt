00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.840
 today we are left with a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.059
 gameplay which is simply a record and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 do you guys so just so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.969
 you remember the little player is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.170
 isr rise a player we recruited there 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.270
 a few days ago guys to have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 made the world's first nuclear double 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 where heffern world if I do not say of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.300
 nonsense just need a little home 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.760
 there is a little bit shocked there I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.379
 a little bit here forget that I think 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.329
 that it was so born world isère that goes 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.440
 we realize a dna simply on the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 all new game mode so that's the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.329
 pump 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 it's a first and simply 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.189
 we did it actually did the update 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.810
 was the first part we did 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.280
 did we realized this part there 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 the gas our first test on these two 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 men on this game wii games modes on 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.330
 the stronghold and gap map and we're going 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.159
 achieve a triple over 90 it so 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 already that's very rare all non lethal 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.170
 of course and especially the guys questioned 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.790
 past we'll miss this one dna total 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 will unfortunately make that two so 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.880
 it will be a double dna team but we 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 do not want to miss this and I will explain 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 why then our friend neither 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 realized his first dna and then went 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.689
 missed a series to over twenty-one 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 second set to more than 25 they were 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.590
 really close to having the flu the dr 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.880
 of the nuclear tribe forgive that it was 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 the first thing then I did 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 a series of 26 and a series of 24 the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.409
 kids series of 24 she was in less 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.820
 three minutes 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 something like that it was really 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.390
 where unfortunately we could not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.070
 finish is at the last run and we have 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.659
 a subscriber who is also a friend of ours 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.909
 it's swansea that will realize 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.710
 sorry excuse me just a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.360
 such has on his side da d'Aynac been made 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.350
 just a few seconds before that of 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.750
 denise hours they realized more or 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.550
 less 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.289
 at the same time in the same minute and 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.520
 then he'll just miss a dena 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.200
 29 guys do not ask me how 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.970
 nuclear at 29 I want terminals not 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.340
 how he managed to do that but he has 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.450
 managed to do it he missed his second 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 nuclear at 29 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.960
 so here you are to see that there are 3 90 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.070
 that he really knows where it's a mode of 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.450
 sick game but me I you 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.830
 explain a little bit what is the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.090
 game mode so I know people are going 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 tell me breathes breathe I can not 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.160
 breathe the pebbles there must 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.350
 I chained I must link it 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 important it's crazy gameplay it's 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.950
 rush and nervous it's beautiful 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.810
 then the game mode you have a robot 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.330
 robot he looks like shopping not this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 that you know of chapter movies 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.730
 just c1 this rebound looks like this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.190
 chapter 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.690
 the mans is then basically you go to 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.100
 side of home pilat you go 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.360
 put next to life and motivating a 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.920
 little take a little bit to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.750
 revive we'll say he 'll come alive and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 then you will have to follow him and 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.880
 to see the cover up to a certain 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.739
 point 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.120
 and when it will happen almost - it will 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.840
 jump in and there you will win 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.820
 your sleeve 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.739
 it's the goal it's escorted if you 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.540
 are from the boat on the side of the escort in 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.220
 did you have to escort this chappy 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.040
 which can be destroyed by the enemy but 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.420
 brave he will repair himself and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.070
 but to escort him you have to 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.209
 stay sideways if you go to the side 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.830
 you are no longer beside him he is going 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.790
 stop one more move and the goal 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.269
 it's like going into led in the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 zone if the enemy so happens to you 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.209
 prevent that you lost the sleeve 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.250
 and if so when you are on the other 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.959
 side must prevent it from happening 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.390
 until this point we have to kill him for 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.220
 must to prevent the halls his allies 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.640
 to make them move it forward all 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.470
 simply 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.060
 and when you get to do that so 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.680
 that it's a cure simply there are some 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.480
 pockets of extension how capture 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.310
 of the flag and it's the same principle 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.440
 the first that will happen if for example 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.530
 you must again bring 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.549
 your robot in your in the point if 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.720
 you bring in three minutes but they 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.130
 will have three minutes to bring their 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.660
 robots that's just this is the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.160
 same thing that will capture posocco was 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.260
 to bring in a robot is a game mode 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.700
 super stylish guys spawn 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
 ok let's say they are a little bit fixed 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.030
 but its fixed but it sounds very fast 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.440
 ie it's like we capture 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.120
 flag maybe at the spots 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.470
 but there is no time to reappear hard 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.090
 it's worse than demolition it's 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.040
 really spawn its bomba meals 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 less is it that we have six moms right and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.910
 we make quads wire of the five girls 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.519
 decide it's crazy that it pulls from everywhere 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.440
 it's a mode to massacre his fashion where you 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.520
 take pleasure you miss a lot but 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.260
