as<00:00:16.510> I<00:00:16.810> discussed<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:18.130> two<00:00:18.880> needles<00:00:19.270> share

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
as I discussed the two needles share

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.710 
as I discussed the two needles share

live on the other side those 12 stitches
stay<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:29.529> needle<00:00:29.890> that<00:00:30.790> is<00:00:30.970> their<00:00:31.210> home

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
okay their neighbors who keep to

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.600 
okay their neighbors who keep to
themselves<00:00:34.960> although<00:00:35.559> they<00:00:35.800> do<00:00:35.860> share<00:00:36.250> yarn

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
themselves although they do share yarn

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.630 
themselves although they do share yarn
you<00:00:37.540> could<00:00:37.690> pretend<00:00:38.020> this<00:00:38.530> neighbor<00:00:39.100> works<00:00:39.430> at

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
you could pretend this neighbor works at

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.299 
you could pretend this neighbor works at
night<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.290> share<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.410> has<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.800> yarn<00:00:41.980> during

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
night and share it has the yarn during

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.689 
night and share it has the yarn during
the<00:00:42.430> day<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:43.600> other<00:00:43.750> neighbor<00:00:44.370> works<00:00:45.370> during

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
the day the other neighbor works during

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.970 
the day the other neighbor works during
the<00:00:45.820> day<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.480> has<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.440> yarn<00:00:47.620> at<00:00:47.769> night

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
the day and has the yarn at night

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.060 
the day and has the yarn at night
something<00:00:48.670> like<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.590> yarn<00:00:50.739> goes

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
something like that so the yarn goes

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.770 
something like that so the yarn goes
round<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.520> round<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.910> stitches<00:00:52.360> stay<00:00:52.570> on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
round and round the stitches stay on

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.350 
round and round the stitches stay on
each<00:00:52.930> needle<00:00:53.200> each<00:00:53.770> needle<00:00:54.309> nips<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:54.940> stitches

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
each needle each needle nips of stitches

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.889 
each needle each needle nips of stitches
it<00:00:55.510> has<00:00:56.250> obviously<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:58.149> is<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.420> next<00:00:58.660> needle

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
it has obviously this is the next needle

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.080 
it has obviously this is the next needle
because<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.350> yarn<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.890> in<00:00:59.920> place<00:01:00.309> for<00:01:00.340> it<00:01:00.850> it

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
because the yarn is in place for it it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.639 
because the yarn is in place for it it
is<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.329> end<00:01:01.539> of<00:01:01.719> that<00:01:01.870> one's<00:01:02.110> beginning<00:01:02.559> of

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
is the end of that one's beginning of

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
is the end of that one's beginning of
that<00:01:02.770> one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
that one
therefore<00:01:04.300> this<00:01:04.420> one's<00:01:04.660> going<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.869> go<00:01:04.989> next

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
therefore this one's going to go next

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.190 
therefore this one's going to go next
now<00:01:07.979> let's<00:01:08.979> say<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.789> forgot<00:01:10.630> what<00:01:10.810> I'm<00:01:10.930> teaching

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
now let's say I forgot what I'm teaching

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440 
now let's say I forgot what I'm teaching

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
here I must look at my little paper over

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.499 
here I must look at my little paper over

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
pulled out allows it to sneak around

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.740 
pulled out allows it to sneak around
looks<00:02:09.310> just<00:02:09.519> like<00:02:09.729> knitting<00:02:10.060> now<00:02:10.239> doesn't<00:02:10.690> it

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
looks just like knitting now doesn't it

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.479 
looks just like knitting now doesn't it
well<00:02:10.869> that's<00:02:11.049> what<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.410> it's<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.400> to

I'd say the directions said take two
stitches<00:02:15.760> from<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:15.970> other<00:02:16.180> needle<00:02:16.739> there

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
stitches from the other needle there

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
this works and so here we are we could

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.110 
this works and so here we are we could
then<00:05:37.930> knit<00:05:38.139> along<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.130> now<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:39.370> know<00:05:39.729> how<00:05:40.060> to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
then knit along so now you know how to
