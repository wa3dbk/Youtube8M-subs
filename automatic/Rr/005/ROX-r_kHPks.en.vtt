out a whd only solution that I picked up
for<00:01:45.009> about<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:45.250> hundred<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.759> twenty<00:01:45.969> pounds

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
for about a hundred and twenty pounds

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.060 
for about a hundred and twenty pounds
although<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:46.899> was<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.290> sale<00:01:47.530> you'll

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
although this was in a sale you'll

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.380 
although this was in a sale you'll
probably<00:01:48.250> find<00:01:48.490> these<00:01:48.700> between<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.149> hundred

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
probably find these between a hundred

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.120 
probably find these between a hundred
and<00:01:49.719> thirty<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.259> hundred<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.740> sixty

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
and thirty and a hundred and sixty

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.590 
and thirty and a hundred and sixty
pounds<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.880> let's<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.240> look<00:01:52.329> where<00:01:52.540> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
pounds so let's have a look where you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.530 
pounds so let's have a look where you
get<00:01:52.750> inside<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.500> box<00:01:53.770> well<00:01:54.729> first<00:01:55.000> off<00:01:55.210> I'm<00:01:55.420> in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
get inside the box well first off I'm in

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.319 
get inside the box well first off I'm in
the<00:01:55.600> UK<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.170> get<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.560> UK<00:01:57.070> power<00:01:57.490> adapters

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
the UK so I get to UK power adapters

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.600 
the UK so I get to UK power adapters
they're<00:01:58.750> both<00:01:58.869> identical<00:01:59.049> they're<00:01:59.799> 5<00:02:00.159> volts

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
they're both identical they're 5 volts

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.649 
they're both identical they're 5 volts
2.5<00:02:01.360> amps<00:02:02.280> there's<00:02:03.280> an<00:02:03.369> infrared<00:02:03.729> extend<00:02:04.509> the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
2.5 amps there's an infrared extend the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.400 
2.5 amps there's an infrared extend the
lead<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.039> remote<00:02:06.340> control<00:02:07.410> there's

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
lead there's a remote control there's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.790 
lead there's a remote control there's
one<00:02:08.700> HDMI<00:02:09.700> lead<00:02:10.410> there's<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> instruction

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
one HDMI lead there's the instruction

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.780

booklet<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:14.470> there's<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> transmitter

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
booklet and then there's the transmitter

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.819 
booklet and then there's the transmitter
receive<00:02:16.180> devices<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.349> transmitter

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
receive devices this is the transmitter

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.589 
receive devices this is the transmitter
as<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.189> see<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.519> front<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:18.879> it's

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
as you can see on the front there it's

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.690 
as you can see on the front there it's
not<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> particularly<00:02:20.200> attractive<00:02:20.370> box<00:02:21.370> let's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
not a particularly attractive box let's

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.649 
not a particularly attractive box let's
have<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> look<00:02:22.060> at<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.269> there's<00:02:22.450> an<00:02:22.540> on/off

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
have a look at it there's an on/off

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.390 
have a look at it there's an on/off
switch<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.379> that<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.739> slide<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.219> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
switch there that you can slide up and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610 
switch there that you can slide up and
down<00:02:24.489> it's<00:02:25.390> got<00:02:25.719> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:26.019> thing<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.500> it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
down it's got a little thing that it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
down it's got a little thing that it
says<00:02:26.739> link<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.640> got<00:02:27.760> some<00:02:27.939> LEDs

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
says link I think that's got some LEDs

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.240 
says link I think that's got some LEDs
behind<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:29.079> it's<00:02:29.230> got<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.379> rubber<00:02:29.650> base<00:02:29.920> here

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
behind it it's got a rubber base here

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.130 
behind it it's got a rubber base here
and<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.909> leg<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.299> spins<00:02:31.569> out<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.019> can

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and this leg that spins out so you can

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.149 
and this leg that spins out so you can
stand<00:02:32.439> it<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.909> HDMI<00:02:34.659> in<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> back

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
stand it up the HDMI in is on the back

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.429 
stand it up the HDMI in is on the back
there<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.579> infrared<00:02:37.000> hole<00:02:37.659> for<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.049> plug<00:02:38.349> in

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
there the infrared hole for the plug in

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.619 
there the infrared hole for the plug in
that<00:02:38.530> wiring<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.189> the<00:02:39.430> power<00:02:39.700> adapter<00:02:39.790> pretty

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
that wiring and the power adapter pretty

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.899 
that wiring and the power adapter pretty
simple<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:41.920> let's<00:02:42.129> just<00:02:42.310> look<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
simple now let's just look at the

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.199 
simple now let's just look at the
receiver<00:02:43.650> very<00:02:44.650> similar<00:02:45.069> box<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.459> same<00:02:45.639> spin

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
receiver very similar box the same spin

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.589 
receiver very similar box the same spin
out<00:02:46.329> leg<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:47.049> same<00:02:47.079> on/off<00:02:47.620> switch<00:02:48.329> it's<00:02:49.329> got

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
out leg the same on/off switch it's got

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.229 
out leg the same on/off switch it's got
a<00:02:49.629> thing<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:50.139> that<00:02:50.170> says<00:02:50.950> IR<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.090> that's

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
a thing there that says IR so that's

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.699 
a thing there that says IR so that's
where<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.480> point<00:02:52.720> your<00:02:52.810> remote<00:02:53.019> control<00:02:53.470> at

where you point your remote control at

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.610 
where you point your remote control at
and<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:54.639> one<00:02:54.879> it's<00:02:55.180> got<00:02:55.389> an<00:02:55.510> HDMI<00:02:55.840> out<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
and on this one it's got an HDMI out and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.780 
and on this one it's got an HDMI out and
the<00:02:57.489> power<00:02:57.849> in<00:02:58.889> now<00:02:59.889> even<00:03:00.220> though<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the power in now even though this is the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.210 
the power in now even though this is the
receiver<00:03:01.329> it's<00:03:01.659> also<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.290> transmitter<00:03:02.769> because

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
receiver it's also a transmitter because

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.979 
receiver it's also a transmitter because

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the same room now one thing that I

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.839 
the same room now one thing that I
thought<00:03:26.109> smacked<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.799> penny-pinching<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.699> bit

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
thought smacked of penny-pinching a bit

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.939 
thought smacked of penny-pinching a bit
was<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.000> fact<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.299> only<00:03:28.449> included<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.199> HDMI

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
was the fact the only included one HDMI

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.219 
was the fact the only included one HDMI

over here but this poor sod you'll have
to<00:03:34.959> go<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.109> source<00:03:35.470> your<00:03:35.680> own<00:03:35.799> HDMI<00:03:36.400> lead<00:03:36.609> for

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
to go and source your own HDMI lead for

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
to go and source your own HDMI lead for
that<00:03:36.849> one<00:03:37.120> look<00:03:37.930> I've<00:03:38.109> got<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> few<00:03:38.560> liner<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:38.979> a

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
that one look I've got a few liner in a

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.789 
that one look I've got a few liner in a
Harris<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.519> thought<00:03:39.639> was<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> bit<00:03:40.000> mean

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
Harris but I thought was a bit mean

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.689 
Harris but I thought was a bit mean
right<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:41.979> let's<00:03:42.159> see<00:03:42.280> how<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.489> fits

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
right so let's see how this fits

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.909 
right so let's see how this fits
together<00:03:42.849> well<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.540> sky<00:03:43.750> HD<00:03:44.109> box<00:03:44.409> only<00:03:44.739> has

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
together well the sky HD box only has

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.890 
together well the sky HD box only has
one<00:03:45.190> HDMI<00:03:46.090> out<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.479> it<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.599> that<00:03:46.750> one's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
one HDMI out on it and that one's

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.659 
one HDMI out on it and that one's
already<00:03:47.109> taken<00:03:47.590> up<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.190> television

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
already taken up going to the television

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.939 
already taken up going to the television
now<00:03:49.269> luckily<00:03:49.510> for<00:03:49.840> me<00:03:49.900> I've<00:03:50.260> got<00:03:50.680> an<00:03:50.799> AV

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
now luckily for me I've got an AV

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.149 
now luckily for me I've got an AV
receiver<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.879> splits<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.569> signal<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:53.709> two

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
receiver that splits the signal to two

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.129 
receiver that splits the signal to two
HDMI<00:03:54.909> out<00:03:55.090> so<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.419> can<00:03:55.599> send<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:56.079> the

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139

if<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.409> don't<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.799> that<00:03:59.949> you'll<00:04:00.129> have<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.400> go

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
if you don't have that you'll have to go

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.149 
if you don't have that you'll have to go
and<00:04:00.639> pick<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:00.849> your<00:04:01.180> own<00:04:01.329> -<00:04:02.049> poor<00:04:02.409> HDMI

all I'm going to do is plug this spare
HDMI<00:04:10.689> lead<00:04:10.930> into<00:04:11.439> the<00:04:11.530> transmitter<00:04:12.009> plug<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
HDMI lead into the transmitter plug the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.969 
HDMI lead into the transmitter plug the
power<00:04:13.419> lead<00:04:13.629> into<00:04:14.169> the<00:04:14.290> back<00:04:14.439> of<00:04:14.709> the

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
power lead into the back of the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.610 
power lead into the back of the
transmitter<00:04:15.370> as<00:04:15.579> well<00:04:15.729> and<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.959> infrared

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
transmitter as well and that infrared

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.580 
transmitter as well and that infrared
emitter<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.900> also<00:04:20.259> going<00:04:20.409> in<00:04:20.530> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
emitter and that's also going in the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.200 
emitter and that's also going in the
transmittance<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.759> box<00:04:21.970> that's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
transmittance so this is the box that's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.469 
transmittance so this is the box that's
staying<00:04:22.599> at<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.590> source<00:04:24.070> next<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.729> sky<00:04:25.000> HD

going<00:04:27.940> there<00:04:28.150> too

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:28.559 
going there too

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.069 
going there too
to<00:04:28.709> send<00:04:29.009> these<00:04:29.159> signals<00:04:29.369> through<00:04:30.209> to<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.539> IR

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:31.079 
to send these signals through to the IR

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.889 
to send these signals through to the IR
port<00:04:31.409> on<00:04:31.589> it<00:04:31.739> now<00:04:32.069> this<00:04:32.249> is<00:04:32.489> the<00:04:32.879> receiver<00:04:33.509> is

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:33.899 
port on it now this is the receiver is

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
an HDMI lead that I found and that's

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.349 
an HDMI lead that I found and that's
plugged<00:04:37.559> into<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.309> back<00:04:38.459> of<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:39.029> television

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:39.359 
plugged into the back of the television

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:42.589 
plugged into the back of the television
here<00:04:39.959> and<00:04:40.459> then<00:04:41.459> I<00:04:41.519> go<00:04:41.669> back<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.969> this<00:04:42.089> start

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
here and then I go back to this start

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.669 
here and then I go back to this start
turn<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:43.529> see<00:04:44.219> the<00:04:44.339> red<00:04:44.519> light<00:04:44.759> there<00:04:45.029> and

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:45.679 
turn it on see the red light there and

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:48.499 
turn it on see the red light there and
switch<00:04:46.679> the<00:04:46.979> receiver<00:04:47.459> on<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.059> let's<00:04:48.329> have<00:04:48.449> a

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
switch the receiver on and let's have a

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.249 
switch the receiver on and let's have a
look<00:04:48.659> at<00:04:48.869> the<00:04:49.079> screen<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.619> see<00:04:50.219> what<00:04:50.369> happens

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
look at the screen and see what happens

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.389 
look at the screen and see what happens
now<00:04:52.259> look<00:04:52.439> at<00:04:52.529> the<00:04:52.589> top<00:04:52.799> left<00:04:52.949> though<00:04:53.159> it<00:04:53.219> says

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:53.399 
now look at the top left though it says

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:55.969 
now look at the top left though it says
connecting<00:04:53.999> to<00:04:54.269> where<00:04:55.199> load<00:04:55.409> of<00:04:55.559> letters<00:04:55.889> I

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
connecting to where load of letters I

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.859 
connecting to where load of letters I
think<00:04:56.129> that's<00:04:56.279> the<00:04:56.369> name<00:04:56.699> internal<00:04:57.509> name<00:04:57.689> of

00:04:57.859 --> 00:04:57.869 
think that's the name internal name of

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.349 
think that's the name internal name of
the<00:04:58.049> box<00:04:58.439> in<00:04:58.769> the<00:04:58.979> lounge<00:04:59.399> and<00:04:59.729> there<00:04:59.879> you<00:04:59.969> go

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:00.359 
the box in the lounge and there you go

the box in the lounge and there you go
it's<00:05:00.809> on<00:05:01.819> which<00:05:02.819> was<00:05:02.939> a<00:05:02.999> bit<00:05:03.119> of<00:05:03.209> a<00:05:03.269> surprise<00:05:03.419> it

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:03.839 
it's on which was a bit of a surprise it

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.109 
it's on which was a bit of a surprise it
works<00:05:04.019> fine<00:05:04.379> I<00:05:04.709> suppose<00:05:05.579> I<00:05:05.699> shouldn't<00:05:05.969> really

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:06.119 
works fine I suppose I shouldn't really

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:07.969 
works fine I suppose I shouldn't really
be<00:05:06.359> so<00:05:06.539> surprised<00:05:07.049> when<00:05:07.259> something<00:05:07.649> does<00:05:07.829> what

directly<00:05:15.269> at<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.659> box<00:05:15.899> it's<00:05:16.139> quite

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
directly at the box it's quite

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.249 
directly at the box it's quite
directional<00:05:17.009> it<00:05:17.489> works<00:05:17.849> fair<00:05:18.719> enough

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
directional it works fair enough

a good test would be to try and play a

a good test would be to try and play a

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
game over the wireless connection I was

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.009 
game over the wireless connection I was
interested<00:06:08.339> to<00:06:08.669> find<00:06:08.849> out<00:06:09.119> if<00:06:09.269> it<00:06:09.509> introduced

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:10.019 
interested to find out if it introduced

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:11.989 
interested to find out if it introduced
any<00:06:10.259> lag<00:06:10.799> in<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.219> signal<00:06:11.579> which<00:06:11.699> will<00:06:11.849> make

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:11.999 
any lag in the signal which will make

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:13.999 
any lag in the signal which will make
the<00:06:12.119> games<00:06:12.359> difficult<00:06:13.019> or<00:06:13.199> impossible<00:06:13.559> to

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
the games difficult or impossible to

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.549 
the games difficult or impossible to
play<00:06:14.399> so<00:06:14.819> I<00:06:14.879> turned<00:06:15.119> on<00:06:15.269> the<00:06:15.389> Xbox<00:06:15.719> 360<00:06:16.409> in<00:06:16.469> the

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:16.559 
play so I turned on the Xbox 360 in the

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.939 
play so I turned on the Xbox 360 in the
lounge

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
lounge

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.919 
lounge
picked<00:06:17.369> up<00:06:17.519> my<00:06:17.609> wireless<00:06:17.909> controller<00:06:18.599> and

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:18.929 
picked up my wireless controller and

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:20.809 
picked up my wireless controller and
head<00:06:19.349> it<00:06:19.469> off<00:06:19.619> to<00:06:19.769> the<00:06:19.859> conservatory<00:06:20.549> I

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
head it off to the conservatory I

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.759 
head it off to the conservatory I
thought<00:06:21.539> it'd<00:06:21.659> be<00:06:21.689> a<00:06:21.779> good<00:06:21.989> idea<00:06:22.259> to<00:06:22.619> put

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:22.769 
thought it'd be a good idea to put

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:24.169 
thought it'd be a good idea to put
something<00:06:23.129> on<00:06:23.219> the<00:06:23.309> people<00:06:23.609> of<00:06:23.699> familiar<00:06:24.149> with

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:24.179 
something on the people of familiar with

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:27.019 
something on the people of familiar with
so<00:06:24.419> I'll<00:06:24.509> put<00:06:24.659> call<00:06:24.899> of<00:06:25.049> duty<00:06:25.439> on<00:06:25.529> and<00:06:26.159> I'm

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
so I'll put call of duty on and I'm

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.789 
so I'll put call of duty on and I'm
normally<00:06:27.449> terrible<00:06:27.989> in<00:06:28.079> this<00:06:28.199> game<00:06:28.409> but<00:06:28.559> even

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:28.799 
normally terrible in this game but even

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:30.709 
normally terrible in this game but even
I<00:06:28.889> managed<00:06:29.219> to<00:06:29.249> get<00:06:29.459> a<00:06:29.489> two<00:06:29.849> person<00:06:30.149> kill

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
I managed to get a two person kill

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.809 
I managed to get a two person kill
streak<00:06:31.109> which<00:06:31.379> is<00:06:31.559> rather<00:06:31.919> impressive<00:06:32.309> for<00:06:32.789> me

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
streak which is rather impressive for me

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.909 
streak which is rather impressive for me
so<00:06:33.419> I<00:06:33.479> didn't<00:06:33.659> notice<00:06:33.929> any<00:06:34.169> lag<00:06:34.589> whatsoever

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
so I didn't notice any lag whatsoever

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.429 
so I didn't notice any lag whatsoever
and<00:06:35.609> the<00:06:35.669> game<00:06:35.879> played<00:06:36.209> fine<00:06:36.569> throughout<00:06:37.110> I

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
and the game played fine throughout I

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.919 
and the game played fine throughout I
didn't<00:06:38.039> notice<00:06:38.309> any<00:06:38.550> blocking<00:06:39.209> or<00:06:39.389> graininess

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:39.929 
didn't notice any blocking or graininess

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:42.140 
didn't notice any blocking or graininess
or<00:06:40.379> any<00:06:40.709> of<00:06:40.829> that<00:06:40.949> mosquito<00:06:41.579> noise

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
or any of that mosquito noise

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.170 
or any of that mosquito noise
I<00:06:42.180> mentioned<00:06:42.750> before<00:06:42.810> I<00:06:43.490> even<00:06:44.490> tried<00:06:44.910> a

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
I mentioned before I even tried a

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.730 
I mentioned before I even tried a
shoot-'em-up<00:06:45.720> just<00:06:46.050> to<00:06:46.139> see<00:06:46.290> if<00:06:46.530> that<00:06:46.680> really

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
shoot-'em-up just to see if that really

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.890 
shoot-'em-up just to see if that really
was<00:06:47.130> any<00:06:47.430> delay<00:06:47.910> whatsoever<00:06:48.150> because<00:06:48.780> this

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
was any delay whatsoever because this

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.930 
was any delay whatsoever because this
kind<00:06:49.080> of<00:06:49.229> thing<00:06:49.410> would<00:06:49.800> be<00:06:49.979> very<00:06:50.340> noticeable

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
kind of thing would be very noticeable

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.270 
kind of thing would be very noticeable
in<00:06:51.060> a<00:06:51.150> game<00:06:51.330> like<00:06:51.510> this<00:06:51.570> and<00:06:52.530> I<00:06:52.800> could<00:06:53.070> play

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
in a game like this and I could play

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.300 
in a game like this and I could play
fine<00:06:53.639> for<00:06:54.060> minutes<00:06:54.750> at<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.930> time<00:06:55.260> without<00:06:55.800> dying

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
fine for minutes at a time without dying

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.710 
fine for minutes at a time without dying
that's<00:06:56.820> quite<00:06:57.060> impressive

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
that's quite impressive

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.110 
that's quite impressive
now<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.620> next<00:06:58.860> thing<00:06:59.010> that<00:06:59.070> I<00:06:59.220> tried<00:06:59.520> was<00:07:00.090> to

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
now the next thing that I tried was to

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.330 
now the next thing that I tried was to
send<00:07:00.570> the<00:07:00.720> wireless<00:07:01.139> signal<00:07:01.440> from<00:07:01.620> upstairs

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
send the wireless signal from upstairs

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.250 
send the wireless signal from upstairs
at<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.699> front<00:07:02.940> of<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.180> house<00:07:03.360> to<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:03.810> back<00:07:04.080> of

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
at the front of the house to the back of

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.840 
at the front of the house to the back of
the<00:07:04.350> house<00:07:04.530> now<00:07:04.770> what<00:07:04.979> I<00:07:05.010> had<00:07:05.220> to<00:07:05.340> do<00:07:05.460> there<00:07:05.669> is

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
the house now what I had to do there is

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.310 
the house now what I had to do there is
put<00:07:05.970> the<00:07:06.240> wireless<00:07:06.600> transmitter<00:07:06.960> on<00:07:07.169> the

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
put the wireless transmitter on the

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.689 
put the wireless transmitter on the
floor<00:07:07.620> for<00:07:07.830> some<00:07:07.919> reason<00:07:08.280> that<00:07:08.400> was<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.610> only

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
floor for some reason that was the only

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.760 
floor for some reason that was the only
way<00:07:08.850> the<00:07:08.970> signal<00:07:09.270> was<00:07:09.389> received<00:07:09.510> but<00:07:10.410> when<00:07:10.620> it

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
way the signal was received but when it

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.620 
way the signal was received but when it
was<00:07:10.979> it<00:07:11.310> worked<00:07:11.639> falling

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
was it worked falling

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.900 
was it worked falling
I<00:07:12.680> was<00:07:13.680> rather<00:07:13.919> restricted<00:07:14.460> in<00:07:14.580> the<00:07:14.639> placement

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
I was rather restricted in the placement

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.719 
I was rather restricted in the placement
of<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.300> transmitter<00:07:15.750> by<00:07:16.440> the<00:07:16.500> infrared<00:07:17.280> lead

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
of the transmitter by the infrared lead

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.990 
of the transmitter by the infrared lead
because<00:07:18.120> it's<00:07:18.270> rather<00:07:18.510> short<00:07:19.340> as<00:07:20.340> you<00:07:20.400> can<00:07:20.850> see

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
because it's rather short as you can see

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.670 
because it's rather short as you can see
from<00:07:21.210> this<00:07:21.300> picture<00:07:21.570> here<00:07:22.050> I've<00:07:22.199> got<00:07:22.590> the

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
from this picture here I've got the

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680 
from this picture here I've got the
transmitter<00:07:23.130> as<00:07:23.460> far<00:07:23.789> away<00:07:23.940> as<00:07:24.060> I<00:07:24.270> can<00:07:24.330> get<00:07:24.570> it

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
transmitter as far away as I can get it

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.270 
transmitter as far away as I can get it
from<00:07:24.810> that<00:07:24.960> skybox<00:07:25.590> while<00:07:25.800> still<00:07:26.070> keeping

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
from that skybox while still keeping

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.790 
from that skybox while still keeping
that<00:07:26.669> infrared<00:07:27.270> emitter<00:07:27.810> lead<00:07:28.050> attached<00:07:28.470> if<00:07:28.710> I

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
that infrared emitter lead attached if I

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.320 
that infrared emitter lead attached if I
wanted<00:07:29.010> it<00:07:29.130> any<00:07:29.250> further<00:07:29.490> away<00:07:29.910> I'd<00:07:30.030> have<00:07:30.180> to

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
wanted it any further away I'd have to

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.480 
wanted it any further away I'd have to
supply<00:07:30.539> some<00:07:30.840> wire<00:07:31.080> into<00:07:31.470> it<00:07:31.620> and<00:07:32.280> another

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
supply some wire into it and another

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.010 
supply some wire into it and another
thing<00:07:32.580> I<00:07:32.789> should<00:07:32.850> mention<00:07:32.970> these<00:07:33.389> boxes<00:07:33.870> are<00:07:33.990> a

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
thing I should mention these boxes are a

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.040 
thing I should mention these boxes are a
little<00:07:34.139> bit<00:07:34.350> unstable<00:07:35.030> that<00:07:36.030> HDMI<00:07:36.570> lead<00:07:36.750> tends

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
little bit unstable that HDMI lead tends

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.540 
little bit unstable that HDMI lead tends
to<00:07:37.229> drag<00:07:37.470> on<00:07:37.650> the<00:07:37.740> back<00:07:37.919> of<00:07:38.100> them<00:07:40.039> but<00:07:41.039> overall

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
to drag on the back of them but overall

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.310 
to drag on the back of them but overall
and<00:07:41.820> very<00:07:42.120> impressed<00:07:42.570> with<00:07:42.720> these<00:07:42.840> wireless

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
and very impressed with these wireless

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.860 
and very impressed with these wireless
hdmi<00:07:43.560> boxes<00:07:44.520> they<00:07:44.639> do<00:07:44.760> exactly<00:07:45.120> what<00:07:45.419> I<00:07:45.449> wanted

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
hdmi boxes they do exactly what I wanted

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.060 
hdmi boxes they do exactly what I wanted
them<00:07:46.050> to<00:07:46.169> do<00:07:46.320> and<00:07:46.349> it's<00:07:46.620> a<00:07:46.710> much<00:07:46.889> better

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.070 
them to do and it's a much better

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.010 
them to do and it's a much better
solution<00:07:47.370> than<00:07:47.700> my<00:07:47.910> previous<00:07:48.180> one<00:07:48.599> it's

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
solution than my previous one it's

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.900 
solution than my previous one it's
almost<00:07:49.349> as<00:07:49.530> though<00:07:49.560> I've<00:07:49.950> got<00:07:50.190> another<00:07:50.460> Sky

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
almost as though I've got another Sky

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.170 
almost as though I've got another Sky
box<00:07:51.210> in<00:07:51.450> the<00:07:51.630> conservatory<00:07:52.349> I<00:07:53.030> probably<00:07:54.030> won't

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 
box in the conservatory I probably won't

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.029 
box in the conservatory I probably won't
use<00:07:54.300> these<00:07:54.570> on<00:07:54.780> screens<00:07:55.229> of<00:07:55.410> maybe<00:07:55.620> more<00:07:55.830> than

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 
use these on screens of maybe more than

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.830 
use these on screens of maybe more than
32<00:07:56.610> inches<00:07:56.940> I<00:07:57.060> think<00:07:57.090> you<00:07:57.330> might<00:07:57.479> notice<00:07:57.810> some

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 
32 inches I think you might notice some

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.350 
32 inches I think you might notice some
artifacts<00:07:58.650> but<00:07:59.190> on<00:07:59.340> smaller<00:07:59.700> sized<00:08:00.000> screens

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
artifacts but on smaller sized screens

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.010 
artifacts but on smaller sized screens
they<00:08:00.810> work<00:08:01.050> great<00:08:01.789> now<00:08:02.789> these<00:08:03.060> are<00:08:03.389> unbranded

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 
they work great now these are unbranded

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.500 
they work great now these are unbranded
boxes<00:08:04.740> you<00:08:05.340> might<00:08:05.520> find<00:08:05.789> them<00:08:06.000> online<00:08:06.240> with

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.510 
boxes you might find them online with

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.980 
boxes you might find them online with
different<00:08:07.320> names<00:08:07.620> if<00:08:08.490> you<00:08:08.669> search<00:08:08.880> for<00:08:08.910> W<00:08:09.360> HDR

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:09.990 
different names if you search for W HDR

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.580 
different names if you search for W HDR
you'll<00:08:10.349> find<00:08:10.650> a<00:08:10.770> few<00:08:11.039> alternatives<00:08:12.440> but<00:08:13.440> all

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.590 
you'll find a few alternatives but all

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.460 
you'll find a few alternatives but all
that<00:08:13.710> remains<00:08:13.979> for<00:08:14.070> me<00:08:14.190> now<00:08:14.460> is<00:08:14.910> to<00:08:15.389> say<00:08:15.570> thanks

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.470 
that remains for me now is to say thanks

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.620 
that remains for me now is to say thanks
for<00:08:16.500> watching
