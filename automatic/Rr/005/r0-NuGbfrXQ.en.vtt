current<00:00:12.570> initiative<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:14.070> they<00:00:14.160> would

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
current initiative and that they would

current initiative and that they would
just<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.639> working<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.210> polishing<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:16.049> some<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
just be working on polishing up some of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
just be working on polishing up some of
the<00:00:16.410> changes<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.070> had<00:00:17.250> already<00:00:17.400> made

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the changes that they had already made

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.849 
the changes that they had already made
but<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> does<00:00:18.779> look<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.020> they've<00:00:19.320> decided<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
but it does look like they've decided to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.890 
but it does look like they've decided to
give<00:00:20.160> us<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> small<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.029> update<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.779> has

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
give us a small little update and it has

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
give us a small little update and it has
some<00:00:22.109> pretty<00:00:22.260> interesting<00:00:22.650> stuff<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
some pretty interesting stuff in it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
some pretty interesting stuff in it
which<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.779> covering<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.199> few<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
which I will be covering a few of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.609 
which I will be covering a few of the
main<00:00:25.859> topics<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> link<00:00:28.019> down

main topics and I will have a link down

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
main topics and I will have a link down
in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.859> description<00:00:28.980> where<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.880> check

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
in the description where you can check

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
in the description where you can check
out<00:00:30.269> everything<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.320> yourself<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.430> as

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
out everything for yourself I know as

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
out everything for yourself I know as
you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.120> using<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.630> new<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you can see I'm using the new and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
you can see I'm using the new and
improved<00:00:34.140> all<00:00:34.890> day<00:00:35.100> 3<00:00:35.460> which<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:36.030> has

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
improved all day 3 which actually has

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110 
improved all day 3 which actually has
had<00:00:36.660> its<00:00:36.840> horizontal<00:00:37.170> recoil<00:00:37.649> reduce<00:00:38.340> not

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
had its horizontal recoil reduce not

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
had its horizontal recoil reduce not
sure<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> had<00:00:39.690> its<00:00:39.989> muzzle<00:00:40.260> velocity

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
sure if it had its muzzle velocity

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.229 
sure if it had its muzzle velocity
increase<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.059> added

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
increase but I think you just added

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.500 
increase but I think you just added
tarzo<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:42.809> recoil<00:00:43.489> reduced<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.329> makes

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
tarzo no recoil reduced but it makes

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
tarzo no recoil reduced but it makes
this<00:00:45.660> weapon<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.649> better<00:00:47.059> over

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this weapon a little bit better over

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.000 
this weapon a little bit better over
range<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.570> still<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> best<00:00:49.110> weapon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
range it's still not the best weapon

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.619 
range it's still not the best weapon
over<00:00:50.399> range<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.000> definitely<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
over range and it's definitely not the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
over range and it's definitely not the
best<00:00:51.960> weapon<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.710> close<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.699> doesn't

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
best weapon up close because it doesn't

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
best weapon up close because it doesn't
have<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> higher<00:00:54.780> fire<00:00:55.170> rates<00:00:55.500> but

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
have one of the higher fire rates but

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.689 
have one of the higher fire rates but
it's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.489> better<00:00:56.969> weapon<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.949> overall<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.250> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's a better weapon now overall and you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
it's a better weapon now overall and you
can<00:00:59.879> definitely<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.930> weapon<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
can definitely use a weapon and not just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
can definitely use a weapon and not just
die<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.239> over<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.660> again<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
die over and over and over again now so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
die over and over and over again now so
yeah<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.549> another<00:01:05.760> weapon<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
yeah it's another weapon we can use and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
yeah it's another weapon we can use and
I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> good<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I think that that is a good thing so I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
I think that that is a good thing so I
had<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> fun<00:01:10.260> playing<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
had a lot of fun playing around with it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469 
had a lot of fun playing around with it
now<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.180> equipped

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
now as you can see I have it equipped

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
now as you can see I have it equipped
with<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> suppressor<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.220> wanted<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
with the suppressor because I wanted to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
with the suppressor because I wanted to
test<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.020> suppressor<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:16.920> dice<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
test out the suppressor because dice is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.050 
test out the suppressor because dice is
a<00:01:18.259> buffing<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.470> suppressed<00:01:20.220> weapons<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
a buffing all suppressed weapons so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
a buffing all suppressed weapons so
anything<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> suppressor<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
anything you put a suppressor on the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
anything you put a suppressor on the
suppressor<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.780> higher<00:01:25.229> muzzle

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
suppressor will now have a higher muzzle

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
suppressor will now have a higher muzzle
velocity<00:01:26.700> no<00:01:27.659> matter<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> weapon<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
velocity no matter what the weapon is so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
velocity no matter what the weapon is so
that's<00:01:29.280> pretty<00:01:29.549> cool<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:30.119> haven't<00:01:30.450> given<00:01:30.810> us

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that's pretty cool they haven't given us

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
that's pretty cool they haven't given us
an<00:01:31.200> exact<00:01:31.560> stat<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
an exact stat I'm not sure what the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
an exact stat I'm not sure what the
exact<00:01:33.659> stats<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:35.040> probably<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
exact stats are it's probably going to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
exact stats are it's probably going to
differ<00:01:35.790> between<00:01:36.090> weapons<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.170> yeah<00:01:37.500> all

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
differ between weapons but yeah all

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.240 
differ between weapons but yeah all
suppress<00:01:38.250> weapons<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.869> higher

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
suppress weapons will have a higher

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
suppress weapons will have a higher
muzzle<00:01:41.250> velocity<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.180> currently<00:01:42.360> have

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
muzzle velocity than they currently have

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
muzzle velocity than they currently have
while<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.560> suppressed<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.000> seemed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
while they are suppressed and it seemed

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
while they are suppressed and it seemed
to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.360> working<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.899> quite<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.740> my

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to be working out quite good in my

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550 
to be working out quite good in my
opinion<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.579> yeah<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.869> think<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.500> be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
opinion and yeah I do think this will be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.929 
opinion and yeah I do think this will be
a<00:01:49.649> good<00:01:49.860> thing<00:01:50.360> now<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.780> third<00:01:52.259> person<00:01:53.100> rear

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
a good thing now the third person rear

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
a good thing now the third person rear
view<00:01:54.180> camera<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.840> jets<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.560> been<00:01:55.740> slightly

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
view camera on jets has been slightly

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
view camera on jets has been slightly
pulled<00:01:56.610> away<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.899> right<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.710> it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
pulled away this right here is how it's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.749 
pulled away this right here is how it's
currently<00:01:59.899> looking<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.740> retail<00:02:02.520> version

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
currently looking in the retail version

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.870 
currently looking in the retail version
of<00:02:03.090> battlefield<00:02:03.509> 4<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.219> actually<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
of battlefield 4 so this is actually the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.809 
of battlefield 4 so this is actually the
warthog<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:07.530> unfortunately<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.369> could

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
warthog and now unfortunately I could

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490 
warthog and now unfortunately I could
not<00:02:08.849> find<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.509> server<00:02:09.810> where<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> could<00:02:10.349> actually

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
not find a server where I could actually

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260 
not find a server where I could actually
use<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.099> Warthog<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> CTE

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
use the Warthog in the CTE

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.200 
use the Warthog in the CTE
so<00:02:13.480> i'm<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.840> i<00:02:14.680> forget<00:02:15.190> what<00:02:15.340> Jedi<00:02:15.670> min<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> think

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
so i'm in i forget what Jedi min I think

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.690 
so i'm in i forget what Jedi min I think
this<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.660> Chinese<00:02:16.930> jet<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.370> yeah<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.640> is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
this is the Chinese jet but yeah this is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
this is the Chinese jet but yeah this is
how<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.180> currently<00:02:19.560> working<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.890> CTE<00:02:21.720> you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
how it's currently working in CTE you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.970 
how it's currently working in CTE you
know<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.930> may<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.410> able<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.650> tell<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
know you may not be able to tell the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.590 
know you may not be able to tell the
difference<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.180> tell<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.570> it's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
difference but I I can tell that it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.290 
difference but I I can tell that it's
slightly<00:02:26.470> pulled<00:02:26.890> away<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.940> exactly

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
slightly pulled away and that's exactly

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.090 
slightly pulled away and that's exactly
what<00:02:28.780> they<00:02:28.900> said<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.350> patch<00:02:29.530> notes<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
what they said in the patch notes that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100 
what they said in the patch notes that
it's<00:02:30.220> slightly<00:02:30.610> pulled<00:02:31.000> away<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:31.990> going

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's slightly pulled away so I'm going

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.510 
it's slightly pulled away so I'm going
to<00:02:32.140> put<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.350> side<00:02:32.650> by<00:02:32.680> side<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.310> maybe

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
to put them side by side and maybe

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.000 
to put them side by side and maybe
you'll<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.820> able<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.000> see<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.620> you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
you'll be able to see it now if you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.540 
you'll be able to see it now if you
couldn't<00:02:36.310> before<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.810> yeah<00:02:38.020> if<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.800> my<00:02:39.280> opinion

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
couldn't before so yeah if in my opinion

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.970 
couldn't before so yeah if in my opinion
I<00:02:39.760> mean<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:40.570> can<00:02:40.780> see<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.440> know<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.800> has<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
I mean it you can see you know it has a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.180 
I mean it you can see you know it has a
bit<00:02:42.430> better<00:02:42.730> field<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.330> view<00:02:43.480> around<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.290> ever

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
bit better field of view around you ever

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.080 
bit better field of view around you ever
since<00:02:45.670> actually<00:02:46.420> last<00:02:46.750> year's<00:02:47.140> game<00:02:47.230> Tom

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
Gamescom 2013 when I think dice released

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.770 
Gamescom 2013 when I think dice released
the<00:02:51.070> paracel<00:02:51.580> storm<00:02:51.610> gameplay<00:02:52.450> always

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
the paracel storm gameplay always

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.600 
the paracel storm gameplay always
wondered<00:02:53.200> why<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> world<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.370> third

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
wondered why in the world the third

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.640 
wondered why in the world the third
person<00:02:54.820> camera<00:02:55.090> was<00:02:55.600> like<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.050> close<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
person camera was like so close to the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.040 
person camera was like so close to the
jet<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.310> felt<00:02:57.550> weird<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:58.090> me<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:58.960> they

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
jet it just felt weird to me so they

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.660 
jet it just felt weird to me so they
have<00:02:59.200> pulled<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.590> slightly<00:03:00.040> away<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.610> do

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
have pulled that slightly away and I do

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.710 
have pulled that slightly away and I do
think<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.570> will<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.940> avid<00:03:03.940> jet<00:03:04.240> pilots

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
think that it will you avid jet pilots

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.300 
think that it will you avid jet pilots
will<00:03:04.900> appreciate<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.160> you're<00:03:06.280> a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
will appreciate that and if you're a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.650 
will appreciate that and if you're a
noob<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.850> me<00:03:07.000> you'll<00:03:07.180> definitely

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
noob like me you'll definitely

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.110 
noob like me you'll definitely
appreciate<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.200> because<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.500> can't<00:03:08.530> fly<00:03:09.120> so
