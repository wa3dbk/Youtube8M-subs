00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
by looking at them and I do a double

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.430 
by looking at them and I do a double
piercing<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:00.489> through<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.900> tail<00:03:02.200> and

then the meaty part you see that one

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.849 
then the meaty part you see that one
more<00:03:06.159> time<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.260> separate<00:03:08.260> them<00:03:08.409> a<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.709> bit

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
more time and separate them a little bit

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.770 
more time and separate them a little bit
so<00:03:09.129> they<00:03:09.220> can<00:03:09.400> cook<00:03:09.609> better<00:03:09.819> all<00:03:10.389> right<00:03:10.599> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
so they can cook better all right you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.940 
so they can cook better all right you
need<00:03:11.230> some<00:03:11.700> some<00:03:12.700> space<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.239> between<00:03:13.359> so<00:03:13.950> this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
need some some space in between so this

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.379 
need some some space in between so this
pan<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.430> getting<00:03:15.579> high<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:16.000> how<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.150> oil
