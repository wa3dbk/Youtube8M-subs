00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.600
 Oh, how are we guys in a review? 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.990
 of the digital program power station the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.929
 most recent version that is the 2.0 is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.780
 a beta version and as you can see is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.740
 a fully compatible version 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.400
 windows 10 to start we can activate 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 or disable the program and in this part 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.250
 appointment we can choose the output that is a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.560
 through hearing aids 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.130
 built-in speakers and speakers 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.790
 external and here we can choose the type 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.990
 of audio that is through one of 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.640
 music through a movie 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.110
 and here we can choose the bass 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 and triple the audio 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.010
 and here we can choose the profile and the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.690
 output of each of these 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.879
 configurations or outputs 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.240
 and what I really liked is that here 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.690
 we can choose a different one 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.020
 different appearance we will click on 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.760
 accept and we will restart the program 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.510
 with the new appearance 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.510
 as you can see it has 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 approximately 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.870
 four different looks and here 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.870
 we can choose the color of the background 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.290
 auto adjusts the volume of the program 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.260
 and in this part quote 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.050
 we can activate the program through 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.540
 an email and password 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.840
 through the official page of bon 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.530
 jovi sticks where we can create ourselves 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.479
 our account and activate the product 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.479
 and here we can choose 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.990
 a different profile I think 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.750
 here we will have more information 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.020
 information about this program 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.060
 here they tell us that it is a beta version and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.380
 here are the social networks that is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 facebook twitter and youtube 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.530
 and here we will have the help icon 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:42.240
 and about the program and online help the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:46.390
 activation and how to install the program and 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.230
 now we will proceed with the tests 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 of the audio 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:59.500
 let's play a song 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.500
 with the program disabled 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.120
 as you can see that is the normal audio and 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.420
 if we activate the program 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.599
 with the music option of course 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.599
 we will have the improved audio 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.540
 and I forgot to tell you two little things 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.170
 which is that here on the bar icon 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.140
 of notifications we will have some 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.920
 options which is to enable or disable the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.970
 Program 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 and choose the type of output open the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.880
 Program 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.660
 and to close it we will right click 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.910
 and on leaving and another of the options that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.510
 I wanted to mention them is that when 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.880
 you install the program automatically 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.910
 restart as soon as the system starts 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.180
 operative but if you want to deactivate 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.910
 or disable that option we will go to 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.609
 task manager and on the part of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.820
 start we will have the programs that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.310
 they start together with the system and to 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.460
 disable what we will right click 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.960
 and on disable 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.440
 but if you want me neither to be together 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.919
 the system only enabled again and 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.919
 ready 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.730
 and as you can see this program is 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.490
 beta version does not offer 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.129
 different configurations than the others 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.819
 versions 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:05:02.300
 but it is not yet it is not 100% finished 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:05.960
 so I invite you to purchase this 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.470
