00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
on this look once I've done the lines

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.840 
on this look once I've done the lines
and<00:01:31.659> plotted<00:01:31.960> out<00:01:32.110> I'll<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:32.530> fill<00:01:32.829> it<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.100> to

fill<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.210> I'm<00:01:34.299> going<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.479> be<00:01:34.569> using<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.929> black

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
fill it in I'm going to be using a black

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.950 
fill it in I'm going to be using a black
stazon<00:01:35.409> root<00:01:35.679> water<00:01:35.890> color<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.329> once<00:01:37.840> I've

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
stazon root water color and once I've

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.149 
stazon root water color and once I've
done<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.319> can<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:38.590> move<00:01:38.679> on<00:01:38.829> to<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.950> rest

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
done that I can then move on to the rest

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.430 
done that I can then move on to the rest
of<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.369> look

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.840 

so<00:01:47.440> there<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.620> go<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.220> eyes<00:01:48.340> are<00:01:48.550> all<00:01:48.610> filled

so there you go the eyes are all filled
in<00:01:49.000> painted<00:01:49.900> black<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.250> next<00:01:51.550> thing

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
in painted black so that the next thing

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.480 
in painted black so that the next thing
to<00:01:51.790> do<00:01:51.910> is<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.210> plot<00:01:52.420> out<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.960> mouth<00:01:53.370> now<00:01:54.370> in

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
to do is to plot out the mouth now in

around<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.910> eye<00:03:46.940> actually<00:03:47.780> create<00:03:48.350> us<00:03:48.620> like

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
around the eye actually create us like

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.120 
around the eye actually create us like
the<00:03:49.640> brow<00:03:49.820> bone<00:03:50.120> up<00:03:50.330> here<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.900> shade<00:03:51.170> towards

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
the brow bone up here so shade towards

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.740 
the brow bone up here so shade towards
the<00:03:52.250> top<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.610> your<00:03:52.700> head<00:03:52.940> rather<00:03:53.209> than<00:03:53.360> down

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the top of your head rather than down

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.550

towards the eye

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.500 
towards the eye
do<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.280> both<00:03:55.340> sides<00:03:55.550> just<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.240> try<00:03:56.420> and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
do this on both sides just to try and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.120 
do this on both sides just to try and
make<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> little<00:03:56.840> bit<00:03:57.020> more<00:03:57.140> 3d<00:03:57.620> even<00:03:58.010> though

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
make it a little bit more 3d even though

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.160 
make it a little bit more 3d even though
it<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:58.400> emitted<00:03:58.910> fill<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.330> want<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.900> try<00:04:00.080> and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
it is not emitted fill I want to try and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.330 
it is not emitted fill I want to try and
make<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.350> look<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.590> little<00:04:00.740> bit<00:04:01.040> more<00:04:01.160> realistic

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:13.930 

you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:38.570 

you

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.690 

you

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:53.850 

you
