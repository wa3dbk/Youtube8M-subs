00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
part of the griffeys you can also pull

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
part of the griffeys you can also pull
this<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.869> brown<00:01:13.350> stuff<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.770> there

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this one up that brown stuff is there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
this one up that brown stuff is there
poop<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.430> called<00:01:14.610> worm<00:01:14.820> castings<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
poop that's called worm castings so that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
poop that's called worm castings so that
actually<00:01:16.619> stays<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> bottom

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
actually stays on the bottom

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280 
actually stays on the bottom
worms<00:01:17.790> migrate<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> top<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
worms migrate to the top and when you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.690 
worms migrate to the top and when you
get<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> full<00:01:19.650> load<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.580> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
get a full load here which we have we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
get a full load here which we have we
can<00:01:20.850> change<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> over<00:01:21.390> later<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.259> that's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
can change it over later so that's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
can change it over later so that's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
this but it'll be decomposed and then

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.180 
this but it'll be decomposed and then
probably<00:02:11.170> another<00:02:11.260> few<00:02:11.560> weeks<00:02:11.740> later<00:02:11.920> it's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
probably another few weeks later it's

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.250 
probably another few weeks later it's
like<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.550> there's<00:02:13.480> no<00:02:13.600> soil<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.050> there<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
way up but they won't survive then we

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.210 
way up but they won't survive then we
can<00:02:22.180> eat<00:02:22.300> life<00:02:22.510> down<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:22.810> obviously<00:02:23.500> I'm

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
can eat life down here obviously I'm

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and things they're all full of seeds a

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.160 
and things they're all full of seeds a
lot<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.060> seeds<00:02:28.270> germinate<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.020> but

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
lot of the seeds germinate but then but
