it<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.940> machine<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.899> makes<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it is about that machine that makes it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.920 
it is about that machine that makes it
sort<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> standard<00:00:55.920> test<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.870> that's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sort of standard test of time that's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.349 
sort of standard test of time that's a
good<00:00:58.079> question

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
good question

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
good question
it's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.600> great<00:01:00.809> table<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.160> has<00:01:02.250> been<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it's a great table but there has been a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
it's a great table but there has been a
lot<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> great<00:01:02.850> tables<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.780> makes

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
lot of great tables so like what makes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
lot of great tables so like what makes
that<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.379> table<00:01:04.769> stand<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that one table stand out and I think it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.750 
that one table stand out and I think it
is<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.310> different

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
is just the way that the different

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.719 
is just the way that the different
features<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> table<00:01:12.600> come<00:01:12.810> together<00:01:13.729> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
features of the table come together you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
features of the table come together you
know<00:01:14.820> Pat<00:01:15.000> Lawler<00:01:15.180> tables<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.680> ability

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
know Pat Lawler tables have this ability

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
know Pat Lawler tables have this ability
to<00:01:17.729> attract<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.900> people<00:01:19.020> who<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.439> the

the side ramp and then if you back the
ball<00:04:34.370> all<00:04:35.030> right<00:04:35.150> see<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.480> your<00:04:35.660> back<00:04:35.810> way<00:04:36.200> you

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
then once you've spelled out greed then

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.130 
then once you've spelled out greed then
you<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:43.270> you'll<00:04:44.270> loft<00:04:44.480> two<00:04:44.660> balls<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.020> get

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
you can you'll loft two balls and get

you can you'll loft two balls and get
multi<00:04:45.410> ball<00:04:45.530> but<00:04:46.160> while<00:04:46.310> you're<00:04:46.460> doing<00:04:46.490> it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
hitting the side ramp that many times is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
hitting the side ramp that many times is
going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.070> build<00:04:49.250> up<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.400> bonus<00:04:49.729> that's<00:04:50.600> going

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
going to build up a bonus that's going

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.790 
going to build up a bonus that's going

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
to give you time to points nice when

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.719 
to give you time to points nice when
it's<00:04:54.950> interesting<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.460> talk<00:04:55.490> about

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
it's interesting that you talk about

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.030 
it's interesting that you talk about
that's<00:04:56.000> how<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.270> pro<00:04:56.540> players<00:04:56.840> playing<00:04:57.680> in

that's how the pro players playing in

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.590 
that's how the pro players playing in
real<00:04:58.370> life<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.120> seems<00:04:59.330> like<00:04:59.419> there's<00:04:59.540> a

the strategy the strategies that they
want<00:05:24.530> to<00:05:24.620> use<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:26.090> we<00:05:26.180> also<00:05:26.330> have

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
know fidelity of tuning details that

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.300 
know fidelity of tuning details that
gets<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.479> table<00:05:38.229> playing<00:05:38.439> you<00:05:38.919> know<00:05:39.039> great

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
gets the table playing you know great

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.850 
gets the table playing you know great
not<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:39.580> for<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:41.020> pro<00:05:41.139> players<00:05:41.349> but<00:05:41.740> getting

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
not just for the pro players but getting

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.589 
not just for the pro players but getting
a<00:05:42.009> claim<00:05:42.449> in<00:05:43.449> a<00:05:43.539> way<00:05:43.719> that<00:05:44.129> reacts<00:05:45.129> as

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
a claim in a way that reacts as

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
realistic as real paper that we have

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.790 
realistic as real paper that we have
here<00:05:48.490> does<00:05:51.479> well<00:05:52.479> I'm<00:05:52.599> gonna<00:05:52.750> go<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.110> play

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
again about some of the mechanics of

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.700 
again about some of the mechanics of
actually<00:06:01.419> taking<00:06:01.900> machines<00:06:02.169> apart<00:06:02.469> and

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
actually taking machines apart and

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.529 
actually taking machines apart and
putting<00:06:02.889> them<00:06:02.979> back<00:06:03.069> together<00:06:03.280> sure<00:06:04.240> sounds

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
putting them back together sure sounds

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:04.740 
putting them back together sure sounds
great
