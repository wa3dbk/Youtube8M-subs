was a brick-built tornado that spun

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.370 
was a brick-built tornado that spun
around<00:01:29.149> New<00:01:29.750> Balances<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:31.789> was<00:01:32.479> tricky<00:01:32.960> I'm

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
around New Balances it was tricky I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.450 
around New Balances it was tricky I'm

off<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.850> camera<00:01:35.179> well<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:35.810> that's<00:01:35.990> why<00:01:36.350> our

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
off in camera well and that's why our

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.109 
off in camera well and that's why our
films<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.369> go<00:01:37.460> up<00:01:37.550> against<00:01:37.909> each<00:01:38.000> other

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
films have to go up against each other

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.749 
films have to go up against each other
because<00:01:38.630> we<00:01:38.990> both<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:39.500> or<00:01:39.950> being<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.429> big

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
because we both have or being the big

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.999

would be a good battle for the two of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:13.170 
would be a good battle for the two of
our<00:01:53.299> films<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.750> go<00:01:53.869> against<00:01:54.170> each<00:01:54.229> other
