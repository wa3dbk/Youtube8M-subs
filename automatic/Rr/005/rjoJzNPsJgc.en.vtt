00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
mean you can do it without going to the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.940 
mean you can do it without going to the
side<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.610> awkward<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
side but it's kind of like awkward that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.630
