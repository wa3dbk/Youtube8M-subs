00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.249 
a friend we made a trade and thought it
was<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> cool<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:56.180> 2011<00:01:57.180> Eagles<00:01:57.570> silver

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
was kind of cool to 2011 Eagles silver

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.550 
was kind of cool to 2011 Eagles silver
of<00:01:58.380> course<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:59.460> pandas<00:02:00.240> those<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.409> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of course two pandas those are really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
of course two pandas those are really
cool<00:02:01.860> everyone<00:02:02.460> says<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> look<00:02:04.079> at

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
cool everyone says it but if you look at

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.950 
cool everyone says it but if you look at
something<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.590> simple<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:06.329> sides<00:02:06.659> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
something as simple as the the sides of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.650 
something as simple as the the sides of
them<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.670> can't<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.119> probably<00:02:09.360> too<00:02:09.450> well

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
them you can't see it probably too well

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.300 
them you can't see it probably too well
in<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> ridges<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.039> actually

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
in there but the ridges are actually

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.390 
in there but the ridges are actually
diagonal<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.970> there

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
diagonal in there

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.649 
diagonal in there
looks<00:02:12.670> different<00:02:13.030> than<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.269> other<00:02:13.390> ones

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
looks different than all the other ones

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.440 
looks different than all the other ones
so<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:15.069> you'd<00:02:16.439> say<00:02:17.549> 2013<00:02:18.549> 2<00:02:19.030> ounce<00:02:19.269> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so then you'd say 2013 2 ounce of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.809 
so then you'd say 2013 2 ounce of
libertad<00:02:19.930> once<00:02:20.230> again<00:02:20.470> very<00:02:20.709> awesome<00:02:21.370> coin<00:02:21.579> if
