sometimes even in that over it we have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
sometimes even in that over it we have
great<00:00:55.129> we<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> soapstone<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.239> heat

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
great we have a soapstone that we heat

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.389 
great we have a soapstone that we heat
up<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.370> r

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
up in there then we can actually see r

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
up in there then we can actually see r
things<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> dish<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
things on it we have a dish that kind of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
things on it we have a dish that kind of
I<00:01:01.800> guess<00:01:01.829> exemplifies<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.180> principle<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I guess exemplifies the principle of the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.670 
I guess exemplifies the principle of the
menu<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:06.630> live<00:01:07.080> spot<00:01:07.320> prawns<00:01:07.560> from

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
menu and it's live spot prawns from

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
menu and it's live spot prawns from
Monterey<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.119> harvested<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> sea<00:01:09.810> water

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Monterey so we harvested the sea water

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.539 
Monterey so we harvested the sea water
from<00:01:10.320> Monterey<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.280> catch<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
from Monterey that's where we catch the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
from Monterey that's where we catch the
spot<00:01:11.760> prawns<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.900> took<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> kelp<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
spot prawns we took some of the kelp and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
spot prawns we took some of the kelp and
then<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.580> took<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> sea<00:01:15.090> rocks<00:01:15.470> from<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
then we took the sea rocks from the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.130 
then we took the sea rocks from the
coast<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.119> we<00:01:18.119> purify<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.540> sea<00:01:18.810> rocks<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
coast and we purify that sea rocks in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.429 
coast and we purify that sea rocks in
the<00:01:19.200> fire<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.970> bath<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the fire we make a little bath from the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.310 
the fire we make a little bath from the
rock<00:01:22.680> purified<00:01:23.340> rocks<00:01:23.640> kelp<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
rock purified rocks kelp and the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.940 
rock purified rocks kelp and the
seawater<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> area<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:28.770> those

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
seawater from the area and so all those

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800 
seawater from the area and so all those
minerals<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.540> warm

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
minerals in there we would just warm

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.610 
minerals in there we would just warm
them<00:01:30.990> up

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
them up

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.800 
them up
and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.370> really<00:01:32.610> gently<00:01:32.880> poach<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and then we really gently poach the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.850 
and then we really gently poach the
prawns<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.190> bath<00:01:35.370> over<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> fire<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
prawns in that bath over the fire and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530
