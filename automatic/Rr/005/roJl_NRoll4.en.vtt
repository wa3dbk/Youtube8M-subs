vigorous<00:00:09.410> anyway<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.650> fruit<00:00:10.860> had<00:00:11.010> been<00:00:11.160> taken

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460

off<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.820> tree<00:00:12.259> earlier<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:14.040> were<00:00:14.130> able<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
off this tree earlier we were able to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.430 
off this tree earlier we were able to
harvest<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.849> last<00:00:15.089> fruit<00:00:15.509> actually<00:00:15.719> sometime

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
harvest the last fruit actually sometime

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.529 
harvest the last fruit actually sometime
in<00:00:16.650> September<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.789> has<00:00:17.940> been<00:00:18.119> very<00:00:18.330> nice

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
in September so this has been very nice

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.080 
in September so this has been very nice
and<00:00:19.529> that's<00:00:19.680> typical<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.310> dooryard<00:00:20.789> tree

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and that's typical for a dooryard tree

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
and that's typical for a dooryard tree
you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.570> harvest<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.199> fruit<00:00:22.380> slowly<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you can harvest the fruit slowly over a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
you can harvest the fruit slowly over a
much<00:00:23.580> longer<00:00:24.000> time<00:00:24.180> than<00:00:24.240> people<00:00:24.810> do

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
much longer time than people do

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.009 
much longer time than people do
commercially<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> talk<00:00:27.900> to

commercially but what I want to talk to

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.150 
commercially but what I want to talk to
you<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.349> should<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> doing<00:00:29.130> with

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you is what should you be doing with

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
you is what should you be doing with
your<00:00:29.519> mango<00:00:29.849> tree<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.019> time

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
your mango tree right now at this time

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.400 
your mango tree right now at this time
of<00:00:31.470> year<00:00:31.550> several<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.690> these

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of year several things you can see these

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
of year several things you can see these
are<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> remnants

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
are the remnants

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
are the remnants
they're<00:00:37.170> called<00:00:37.380> Reyes<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> where

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
they're called Reyes and this is where

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
they're called Reyes and this is where
the<00:00:38.879> fruit<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.239> held<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> tree<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the fruit was held on the tree and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
the fruit was held on the tree and
you'll<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.910> located<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> end<00:00:43.110> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you'll see it's located at the end of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.950 
you'll see it's located at the end of
the<00:00:43.320> branches<00:00:43.739> where<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> fruit<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the branches where the fruit were and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.639 
the branches where the fruit were and
these<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.200> died<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.780> these<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:49.050> act<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
these have died and these will act as a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
these have died and these will act as a
source<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.399> disease<00:00:51.120> infection<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
source of disease infection for the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
source of disease infection for the
flowers<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> fruit<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> spring<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
flowers and the fruit in the spring so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
flowers and the fruit in the spring so
in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> home<00:00:55.289> landscape<00:00:55.680> something<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
in the home landscape something that you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.760 
in the home landscape something that you
can<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.149> especially<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.079> keep<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.440> trees

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
can do especially if you keep your trees

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.500 
can do especially if you keep your trees
small<00:00:59.309> enough<00:00:59.579> where<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> reach<00:01:00.270> them

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
small enough where you can reach them

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.080 
small enough where you can reach them
from<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> ground<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:02.129> eat<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> remove

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
from the ground is to eat is to remove

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
from the ground is to eat is to remove
these<00:01:03.780> old<00:01:04.049> rake<00:01:04.290> is's<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.920> parts<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
these old rake is's or parts of the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.080 
these old rake is's or parts of the
panicle<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> usually<00:01:08.640> by

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
panicle and you can do that usually by

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.149 
panicle and you can do that usually by
just<00:01:09.330> snapping<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
just snapping it off so you see here and

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
just snapping it off so you see here and
it's<00:01:14.159> something<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.930> will<00:01:15.930> reduce<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it's something that will reduce the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.710 
it's something that will reduce the
amount<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:18.860> disease<00:01:20.360> inoculum<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.770> your<00:01:22.770> tree

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
amount of disease inoculum on your tree

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
amount of disease inoculum on your tree
so<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> flowers<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.560> fruits<00:01:25.830> there's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so when it flowers and fruits there's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.420 
so when it flowers and fruits there's
less<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.220> thing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
less of this around so that's one thing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
less of this around so that's one thing
that<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.570> time<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.049> year<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that you can do at this time of year and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399 
that you can do at this time of year and
this<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.100> help<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.490> set<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.850> tree<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.380> for<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this will help to set your tree up for a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.249 
this will help to set your tree up for a
more<00:01:34.890> healthy<00:01:35.340> flowering<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> fruiting<00:01:36.810> next

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
more healthy flowering and fruiting next

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
more healthy flowering and fruiting next
year<00:01:38.090> another<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:39.450> too<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.970> do

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
year another thing too is you can do

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.440 
year another thing too is you can do
some<00:01:42.360> selective<00:01:42.960> pruning<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.340> remove<00:01:45.060> any

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
some selective pruning to remove any

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.249 
some selective pruning to remove any
dead<00:01:46.049> branches<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:48.420> hopefully

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
dead branches that you see to hopefully

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
dead branches that you see to hopefully
increase<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.070> amount<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.490> branching<00:01:51.390> I'll

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
increase the amount of branching I'll

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
increase the amount of branching I'll
give<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> an<00:01:52.380> example<00:01:52.770> over<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
give you an example over here on this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
give you an example over here on this
side<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> tree<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> chute<00:01:57.719> that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
side of the tree you have a chute that's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.760 
side of the tree you have a chute that's
that's<00:01:58.350> very<00:01:58.619> long<00:01:59.299> very<00:02:00.299> high<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> come

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that's very long very high you can come

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.569 
that's very long very high you can come
in<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.729> remove<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:04.250> take<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
in and you can remove this take that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.089 
in and you can remove this take that
last<00:02:06.210> couple<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.750> feet<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
last couple of feet off of this and this

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.449 
last couple of feet off of this and this
will<00:02:08.369> flower<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.149> branch<00:02:09.560> down<00:02:10.560> below<00:02:10.979> here

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
will flower and branch down below here

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
will flower and branch down below here
so<00:02:11.720> you're<00:02:12.720> removing<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so you're removing so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.970 
so you're removing so
that<00:02:13.800> over<00:02:14.400> vigorous<00:02:14.910> growth<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:16.110> another

that over vigorous growth or another

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.220 
that over vigorous growth or another
option<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.630> ahead<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
option would be to go ahead and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.550 
option would be to go ahead and
selectively<00:02:20.190> remove<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.330> few<00:02:21.570> limbs<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.320> limb

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
selectively remove a few limbs this limb

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.210 
selectively remove a few limbs this limb
is<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.220> straight<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:23.760> into<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> sky<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
is going to straight up into the sky and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
is going to straight up into the sky and
you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.490> cut<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.330> above<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.050> little

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you can cut this just above this little

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.670 
you can cut this just above this little
collar<00:02:28.620> area<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:30.390> will<00:02:30.690> reduce<00:02:31.110> its

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
collar area and that will reduce its

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
collar area and that will reduce its
upward<00:02:32.220> growth<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.270> won't<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.600> any

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
upward growth and you won't get any

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.530 
upward growth and you won't get any
vigorous<00:02:34.320> growth<00:02:35.130> from<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:35.730> pruning<00:02:36.330> cut

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
vigorous growth from this pruning cut

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.150 
vigorous growth from this pruning cut
here<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.380> want<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> leave<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> stub

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
here you don't want to leave a stub

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.400 
here you don't want to leave a stub
because<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.240> vigorous<00:02:39.660> bushy

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
because you will get vigorous bushy

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.020 
because you will get vigorous bushy
growth<00:02:40.800> which<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.160> don't<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.700> that's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
growth which you don't want that's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.750 
growth which you don't want that's
undesirable<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.680> there's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.250> few<00:02:44.459> things<00:02:44.640> you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
undesirable so there's a few things you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.630 
undesirable so there's a few things you
can<00:02:44.940> do<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.570> pruning<00:02:46.370> another<00:02:47.370> thing

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
can do with the pruning another thing

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.620 
can do with the pruning another thing
you'll<00:02:48.000> notice<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.590> there<00:02:50.370> are<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> few<00:02:50.940> we've

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
you'll notice is there are a few we've

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.170 
you'll notice is there are a few we've
been<00:02:51.810> very<00:02:52.020> wet<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> after<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.790> during<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
been very wet and after and during the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.570 
been very wet and after and during the
summer<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.680> wet<00:02:56.010> humid

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
summer when we have very wet humid

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.850 
summer when we have very wet humid
weather<00:02:57.030> sometimes<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.050> get<00:02:58.140> leaf<00:02:58.410> diseases

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
weather sometimes you get leaf diseases

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.640 
weather sometimes you get leaf diseases
and<00:02:59.310> what<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.300> seeing<00:03:00.540> here<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:01.290> little

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
and what you're seeing here this little

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.530 
and what you're seeing here this little
this<00:03:01.830> these<00:03:02.730> red<00:03:03.030> blotches<00:03:04.040> here<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.360> an

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this these red blotches here this is an

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.780 
this these red blotches here this is an
algae<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:09.420> actually<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.790> parasitic

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
algae and it's actually a parasitic

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.580 
algae and it's actually a parasitic
algae<00:03:12.570> in<00:03:12.660> other<00:03:12.780> words<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.110> feeds<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
algae in other words it feeds on the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.630 
algae in other words it feeds on the
leaf<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.930> easily<00:03:16.290> controlled<00:03:16.709> with

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
leaf and this is easily controlled with

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.880 
leaf and this is easily controlled with
a<00:03:17.940> copper<00:03:18.540> spray<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.380> becomes<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.860> problem

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
a copper spray if it becomes a problem

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.100 
a copper spray if it becomes a problem
the<00:03:20.820> problem<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.390> red<00:03:21.540> algae<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.959> that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
the problem with the red algae is that

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.620 
the problem with the red algae is that
can<00:03:22.320> cause<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.830> leaves<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.459> drop<00:03:24.390> off

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
can cause the leaves to drop off

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.840 
can cause the leaves to drop off
prematurely<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:26.160> not<00:03:26.340> something<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.730> get

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
prematurely it's not something to get

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.820 
prematurely it's not something to get
too<00:03:27.060> excited<00:03:27.570> about<00:03:27.780> especially<00:03:28.440> since<00:03:28.650> we're

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
too excited about especially since we're

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.400 
too excited about especially since we're
going<00:03:29.070> into<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> dry<00:03:29.610> season<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.420> also<00:03:31.200> if

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
going into the dry season and also if

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.620 
going into the dry season and also if
you<00:03:31.500> keep<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> tree<00:03:32.070> open<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.730> light<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.600> to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you keep the tree open to light and to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.110 
you keep the tree open to light and to
air<00:03:34.110> movement<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.769> shouldn't<00:03:35.100> become<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.670> big

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
air movement it shouldn't become a big

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.300 
air movement it shouldn't become a big
problem<00:03:36.420> there's<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.440> few<00:03:37.650> other<00:03:37.830> diseases

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
problem there's a few other diseases

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.630 
problem there's a few other diseases
here<00:03:39.150> again<00:03:39.750> we've<00:03:39.989> been<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.560> wet<00:03:41.100> hot<00:03:41.430> and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
here again we've been so wet hot and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.750 
here again we've been so wet hot and
humid<00:03:42.170> there's<00:03:43.170> some<00:03:43.380> other<00:03:43.530> leaf<00:03:44.100> diseases

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
humid there's some other leaf diseases

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.819 
humid there's some other leaf diseases
here<00:03:45.000> these<00:03:45.480> aren't<00:03:45.810> anything<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.500> get<00:03:46.620> too

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
here these aren't anything to get too

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.100 
here these aren't anything to get too
excited<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.489> right<00:03:47.880> now<00:03:48.090> because<00:03:48.630> as<00:03:48.810> we

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
excited about right now because as we

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.470 
excited about right now because as we
enter<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.709> drier<00:03:50.070> part<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.610> year<00:03:50.850> these

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
a lot of dry conditions and actually do

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.930 
a lot of dry conditions and actually do

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
better with the drier conditions so this

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
better with the drier conditions so this

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
you should also turn off the irrigation

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.900 
you should also turn off the irrigation
basically<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:49.080> far<00:05:49.289> as<00:05:49.440> insects<00:05:50.070> during<00:05:50.820> the

winter the fall and winter really should
not<00:05:53.070> be<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.280> problem<00:05:53.539> occasionally<00:05:54.539> there<00:05:55.110> are
