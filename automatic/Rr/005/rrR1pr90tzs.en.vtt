00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.999 
strap and this this piece right here is
very<00:01:35.340> important<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.299> acts<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.900> leverage<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
very important it acts as leverage to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
very important it acts as leverage to
tighten<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> top<00:01:38.909> part<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
tighten down over the top part of the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
tighten down over the top part of the
horse's<00:01:39.900> nose<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.280> would

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
horse's nose just like a bit would

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.420 
horse's nose just like a bit would
control<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> horse's<00:01:42.750> nose<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.009> then

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
control the horse's nose as well so then

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
control the horse's nose as well so then
I'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> snap<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> side<00:01:45.890> both

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I'm going to snap it to the side both

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.690 
I'm going to snap it to the side both
sides<00:01:48.079> just<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.259> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
sides just like this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
sides just like this
and<00:01:51.330> then<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.380> to

horse that I'm actually going to change

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.380 
horse that I'm actually going to change
the<00:01:58.110> way<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.950> he's<00:01:59.159> used<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> pressure<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the way that he's used to pressure so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
the way that he's used to pressure so
I'm<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.110> kind<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.320> pull<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619

used<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.750> different<00:02:13.200> pressure<00:02:13.470> just

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
used to that different pressure just

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.920 
used to that different pressure just
like<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> might<00:02:14.520> change<00:02:14.819> from<00:02:15.120> from<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.720> bit

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
like you might change from from one bit

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
like you might change from from one bit
to<00:02:16.110> another<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.800> important<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> let<00:02:17.459> them
