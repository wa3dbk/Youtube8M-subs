00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
really great spirit which I think we

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
really great spirit which I think we
believe<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:01.949> important<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> category

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
believe is very important for a category

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.649 
believe is very important for a category
like<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> car<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.299> another<00:01:06.299> very

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
like that the car is another very

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
like that the car is another very
important<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.799> we've<00:01:07.950> done<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
important thing what we've done is the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
important thing what we've done is the
whole<00:01:08.880> layout<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.960> wanted<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.560> clean

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
whole layout we wanted to really clean

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
whole layout we wanted to really clean
up<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> center<00:01:11.790> stack<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> also

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
up the center stack that's what we also

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
up the center stack that's what we also
have<00:01:13.290> moved<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.340> IntelliLink

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
have moved up the IntelliLink

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
have moved up the IntelliLink
in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.689> right<00:01:15.930> position<00:01:16.439> which<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> basically

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
in the right position which is basically

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
in the right position which is basically
on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> same<00:01:17.880> layer<00:01:18.270> lineup<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.590> cluster

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
on the same layer lineup as the cluster

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
on the same layer lineup as the cluster
and<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:21.000> helps<00:01:21.390> us<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> keep<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and that really helps us to keep the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
and that really helps us to keep the
hands<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> wheels<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.060> eyes<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
hands on the wheels and the eyes on the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
hands on the wheels and the eyes on the
road<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.259> has<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:26.130> beautiful<00:01:26.460> intuitive

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
road and has a very beautiful intuitive

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.819 
road and has a very beautiful intuitive
layout<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.380> believe<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.770> very

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
layout which we believe is very

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.580 
layout which we believe is very
important<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> vehicle<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.049> car

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
important for a vehicle like the car

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.690 
important for a vehicle like the car
another<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.729> distinctive<00:01:34.610> elements<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
another very distinctive elements you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.789 
another very distinctive elements you
can<00:01:35.880> find<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> car<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.619> we've

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
can find in the car is also what we've

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
can find in the car is also what we've
done<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.189> call<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.610> top<00:01:39.119> town<00:01:39.479> top-down<00:01:40.259> means

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
done we call it top town top-down means

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
done we call it top town top-down means
we're<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.040> moving<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.970> components<00:01:42.810> from

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
we're really moving the components from

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
we're really moving the components from
the<00:01:43.170> car<00:01:43.409> above<00:01:43.860> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.909> car<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the car above into the car which is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960 
the car above into the car which is
lower<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.320> helps<00:01:46.649> us<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
lower and that helps us really again to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
lower and that helps us really again to
emphasize<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.869> quality<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.369> German

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
emphasize the quality and this German

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030 
emphasize the quality and this German
position<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:52.079> we're<00:01:52.290> always<00:01:52.439> talking<00:01:52.770> about

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
position what we're always talking about

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
position what we're always talking about
for<00:01:53.670> example<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.509> steering<00:01:54.810> wheel

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
for example like this steering wheel

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
for example like this steering wheel
when<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> grab<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> steering<00:01:56.130> wheel

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
when you grab the steering wheel

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
important for a vehicle like this so if

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.560 
important for a vehicle like this so if
you<00:03:34.830> look<00:03:34.950> at<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> whole<00:03:35.489> income<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.420> look

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
you look at the whole income if you look

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.300 
you look at the whole income if you look
at<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.750> interior<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.560> then<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.830> combine<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
at the interior and then you combine it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.790 
at the interior and then you combine it
with<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.640> exterior<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:40.050> harmonized

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
with the exterior it's one harmonized

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.729 
with the exterior it's one harmonized
execution<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.880> really<00:03:42.540> shows<00:03:42.810> how<00:03:43.230> strong

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
execution and really shows how strong
