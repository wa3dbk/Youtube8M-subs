00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.319
 Welcome to a new video you see 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 a gameplay of mine on 7 I think 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.040
 a really good gameplay there were real 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.900
 a couple of cool scenes and a lot 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 very very exciting finale has me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.139
 personally liked 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.330
 check it out and form yourselves 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.859
 be like lawson as always a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 thumb that are just switch off 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 leave there is no thing so or times to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 I would like to talk about the topic first of all 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.080
 times ask that here your opinion in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.250
 the comments I write have the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 whole story with the microphone like that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
 Rebuilt a bit and that is the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.140
 microphone poor now no longer behind the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.309
 screen back there and that's enough 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 microphone over the screen but it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809
 rather right next to me and gives me that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.670
 Side by side, the cool is the sound 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 it looks better worse 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.879
 like to write my comments 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 regardless of that, I will 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 decide if we go to the old one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 return or keep that way 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.890
 delay people now on the topic of today 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 I want the 50,000 special day 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 tell you a lot today and me 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 everything I want to tell everything everything 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.030
 you get 50,000 jobs 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 all information from me 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.820
 it will be a bit different though 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.890
 first a short one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 prehistory and indeed my best 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 buddy who studies with me also looks 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380
 a youtube videos and give me that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.310
 every now and then a few tips 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.900
 greet you adrian when you see that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.650
 and he meant so yes there are so these 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 specials on youtube if the people 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.740
 reach a brand somewhere 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.560
 Take this to yourself in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.979
 to thank any form 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 however, these specials are somehow 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 not to be understood that the people 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 back somehow you say thank you in that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.509
 you sit down longer a video 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.000
 But people produce nothing 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.680
 tangible back and will be on this 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.229
 internet just want to change that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.360
 and that's why 59,000 euros will be special 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.920
 in that five spectators 5g 25 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.500
 11 23 45 people get the opportunity 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.520
 to spend a day around her 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 Just like that and not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.530
 something but a special day 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.700
 which day will he be directly the info 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.340
 in the foreground the 28th of june sunday next 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.170
 week exactly in a week 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.970
 this video on sunday on when it's on 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.709
 sunday seht is it in a week if 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.190
 it looks different , it is nevertheless the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:23.030
 28 june a sunday where in stuttgart and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.709
 what happens there on this day finds one 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.629
 pre testing event instead of how to do that 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.180
 Calling this speed racing event means 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.959
 that my own citizens are the food 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.150
 it is being eaten there and all the people are 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.370
 on this day there are the citizen me 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.989
 believe can taste for free 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.790
 I'm one hundred percent sure though 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.709
 In any case, there will probably be one 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 give possibility to get the otherwise 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.420
 I would not like testing event 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.950
 Hot tea is in the sense of taste 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.900
 I would like to invite you 5 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.510
 from you because I'm an abo special 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.730
 want to do something different 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.840
 nothing boring nothing in the form of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.140
 the video but what you are watching 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.910
 as a human appreciates me 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.129
 I often do not think that's the case 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.200
 spectators are somehow as if 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.880
 you also pay my way 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.650
 that you have so many spectators then 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.359
 everything is bigger youtuber that is not 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.180
 idea 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.500
 700,000 calls a month or so 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.599
 among the only ones 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.220
 still worthy of people is difficult 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.750
 and then on the gamescom on the video 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.790
 the viewers have 30 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.150
 Seconds times stand for hours 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.250
 on 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.690
 I think that's a bit silly honest 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.109
 said and I would like that personally 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.849
 to change 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.609
 That's why I give five of you the 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.870
 Possibility to spend an afternoon with me 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.489
 to spend the whole afternoon so that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.769
 you really a little bit too 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:48.049
 time has so far the matter 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.239
 then we'll get to it like 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.859
 you apply for it because the five 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.069
 people have to be selected somehow 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.419
 before you apply I want to 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.829
 point out that it necessarily 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.019
 It is important that you are ahead with yours 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.609
 parents or other persons the 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.780
 have to decide whether you am 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.359
 28 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.630
 can be in Stuttgart and indeed from around 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.889
 14 30 to 14 30 to 16 o'clock 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.120
 and it's important to be there too 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.640
 can someone do that then 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.000
 at the end, none is accepted 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.100
 Time is so close 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.570
 I can not just banned in the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.890
 last moment so please clarify that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.420
 before with your parents is off completely 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.510
 important then now to the topic rated 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:34.400
 how do we do it I have a few 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.540
 Thoughts made a bit back and forth 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.090
 drifted could not decide 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.460
 which method of selection I then am 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.680
 I would like to end now 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.440
 Decided that we just did that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.780
 directly under this video and make 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.730
