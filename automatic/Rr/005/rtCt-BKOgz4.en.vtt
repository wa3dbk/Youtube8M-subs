00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.150
 well we record everything depends on the height of the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.740
 person depending on the different height 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.650
 the other turns it has to be 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.200
 firm assets insured with the end of the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.930
 fingers because otherwise it will be loose and 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.689
 will not stay cool shirt with letter 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.329
 put a job with the search 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 how much more basic species 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.859
 the recording but list with the hair is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 worked with this 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.030
 this very big opening that I 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.840
 milestones if the most humble person 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.470
 closed 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.640
 I ask the tie and the hair and the pattern 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.200
 here the Indians 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.230
 I take a walk and the second replica 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.880
 Look at the Japanese boot knot for me the risk of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.540
 tie has to be the same color as the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.200
 shirt 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.050
 my in the old style the tie always 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.090
 have to be darker than the media to 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 otherwise we will not record a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.600
 with a plaid sweater with 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.150
 a tie full of details 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 so he wore a plain tie with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 the blouse days a little more or else a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 blouse calculated with a tie says a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
 thing that draws a lot of attention and with 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 conflicting information she completes 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.690
 recently recorded in the case of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.300
 saleswoman who did it again for me and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.090
 the name because I give the 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.770
 complexity of doing what you notice is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.950
 What I 've been doing for Pedro does not take away. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.050
 is not recorded 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.810
 She ends up taking TauÃ¡ is the person. 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.880
 perfect a more extravagant necktie 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 other recordings a little more serious 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 from there you can take a little mood 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.480
 in this way without recording a more 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 then stripped off this seriousness in 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 on a day to day basis for the job name 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.400
 pass a good image and sometimes requires 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.910
 the use of a tie will serve my 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.550
 day to day is essential 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.550
