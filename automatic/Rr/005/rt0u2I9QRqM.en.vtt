00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
just because I want the back to be low

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.520 
just because I want the back to be low
to<00:00:57.719> show<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.079> tattoo<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.770> stuff<00:00:59.010> so<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> would

to show my tattoo and stuff so you would

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
to show my tattoo and stuff so you would
just<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.100> part<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> way

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
just have this part going all the way

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
just have this part going all the way
around<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.719> cut<00:01:04.019> mine<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.559> bit

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.330 
around but I cut mine a little bit
thicker<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.810> back<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
thicker in the back so right now you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.330 
thicker in the back so right now you
have<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:09.540> looks<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> won't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
have it looks like this so it won't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
have it looks like this so it won't
really<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.909> off<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> shoulder<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.439> yet<00:01:15.409> okay
