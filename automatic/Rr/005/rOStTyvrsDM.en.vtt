00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.020
 Here I take such a tonic and take any 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.160

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.640

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 which but preferably opens yes here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.939

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.210
 Tint this balm 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.850

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.579
 a week 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:39.799
 Depending on the shade of hair I want 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:44.509
 get here today i'm a little bit about them 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.869
 tinted hair can someone say 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.789
 that these things spoil the hair more 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.729
 than shampoo and such purple we will 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.310
 so call them but sometimes this violet 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.770
 shock he does not give such effect what you 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.939
 want to get you want for example 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.530
 completely more ashy get hair 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.679
 but you don't want it completely too 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.180
 make out here this thin one because 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.190
 She paints if just put on hair 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:21.739
 very much you will be almost purple 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:26.540
 color itself is not up to dark gray fiolt 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:29.540
 overall who wants to try the hair not 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.269

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.329
 now quite normal you know how i am 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.540
 I'm experimenting with him as I like 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.540
 experiment but i advise everyone 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 try and me this tonic already 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.130
 probably more than a year, that is, you understand 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.010
 what expense can you use and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.769
 shampoo so violet and when you 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.290
 want more such straight mother of pearl 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.669

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.200
