00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.500 
everyone's used to your typical piezo
triggers<00:02:04.540> which<00:02:04.870> are<00:02:05.170> basically<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:07.210> based

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
triggers which are basically it's based

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.380 
triggers which are basically it's based
on<00:02:07.660> vibration<00:02:08.290> so<00:02:09.010> when<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.310> hit<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.790> hit

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
on vibration so when you hit that hit

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
on vibration so when you hit that hit
the<00:02:10.570> drum<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.560> vibrates<00:02:11.620> sends<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.700> signal<00:02:13.180> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the drum it vibrates sends a signal to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.960 
the drum it vibrates sends a signal to
the<00:02:13.960> brain<00:02:14.140> comes<00:02:15.130> back<00:02:15.430> well<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> problem

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the brain comes back well the problem

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.060 
the brain comes back well the problem
with<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> lot<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.800> lag

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
with this is that you get a lot of lag

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.000 
with this is that you get a lot of lag
time<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.700> problem<00:02:19.540> with<00:02:19.690> piezo<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
time in problem with piezo is that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.500 
time in problem with piezo is that
there's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.310> lot<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.460> what<00:02:21.760> drummers<00:02:22.330> call

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
there's a lot of what drummers call

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.560 
there's a lot of what drummers call
crosstalk<00:02:23.200> or<00:02:23.530> misfiring<00:02:24.070> but<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.150> did<00:02:25.390> last

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
crosstalk or misfiring but we did last

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.120 
crosstalk or misfiring but we did last
year's<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.110> came<00:02:26.320> out<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.590> what's<00:02:26.890> called

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
year's we came out with what's called

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.320 
year's we came out with what's called

it's a portable drum surface
as<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:33.020> looks<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.070> bad<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:35.180> could

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
as you see looks like a bad you could

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.690 
as you see looks like a bad you could
play<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:35.900> hand<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.980> go<00:03:37.130> here<00:03:37.520> we've

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
play it in your hand you go here we've

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000 
play it in your hand you go here we've
done<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> mock-up<00:03:38.270> of<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.690> drum<00:03:38.960> kit<00:03:38.990> of<00:03:39.440> what

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
done a mock-up of a drum kit of what

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.560 
done a mock-up of a drum kit of what
anything<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.580> could<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.880> with<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> drumset

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
anything you could do with the drumset

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.650 
anything you could do with the drumset
we've<00:03:41.780> taken<00:03:41.990> some<00:03:42.290> hoops<00:03:42.560> put<00:03:43.160> them<00:03:43.280> together

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
we've taken some hoops put them together

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.860 
we've taken some hoops put them together
on<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:45.440> installation<00:03:46.780> put<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.900> on<00:03:48.050> plug<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.560> in

on it installation put it on plug it in

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.080 
on it installation put it on plug it in
and<00:03:50.870> you're<00:03:51.050> ready<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.350> go<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:52.400> have<00:03:52.550> triggers

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
and you're ready to go we have triggers

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.900 
and you're ready to go we have triggers
called<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.720> rim<00:03:53.930> shot<00:03:54.260> these<00:03:55.040> rim<00:03:55.340> shots<00:03:55.670> are

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
called the rim shot these rim shots are

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.540 
called the rim shot these rim shots are
triggers<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.870> can<00:03:57.020> clip<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.500> old<00:03:57.800> any<00:03:58.100> kind<00:03:58.430> of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
triggers you can clip on old any kind of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.030 
triggers you can clip on old any kind of
rim<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.790> your<00:03:59.270> whole<00:03:59.570> drum<00:03:59.840> kit<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.800> case

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
rim of your whole drum kit in this case

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.070 
rim of your whole drum kit in this case
we're<00:04:01.280> using<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.670> pan<00:04:01.940> like<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.300> prime<00:04:02.630> band<00:04:02.870> for

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
we're using a pan like a prime band for

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.870 
we're using a pan like a prime band for
eggs<00:04:03.260> or<00:04:03.530> whatever<00:04:03.860> can<00:04:04.400> kind<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.640> give<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.850> an

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
eggs or whatever can kind of give you an

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.320 
eggs or whatever can kind of give you an
idea<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.270> what<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.570> do<00:04:05.900> with<00:04:06.110> this<00:04:06.260> stuff

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.740 

so<00:04:11.330> now<00:04:12.020> if<00:04:12.140> we<00:04:12.230> come<00:04:12.500> down<00:04:12.650> here<00:04:13.750> we're

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
so now if we come down here we're
