so<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.109> is<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.470> electro-harmonix<00:00:02.100> slammy

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:02.759 
so this is the electro-harmonix slammy

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.690 
so this is the electro-harmonix slammy
pedal<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.959> foot<00:00:04.169> controlled

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
pedal and it's a foot controlled

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.789 
pedal and it's a foot controlled
polyphonic<00:00:05.700> pitch<00:00:06.270> shifter<00:00:06.799> polyphonic

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
polyphonic pitch shifter polyphonic

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.930 
polyphonic pitch shifter polyphonic
really<00:00:08.040> means<00:00:08.219> you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.429> hit<00:00:08.580> all<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> notes

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
really means you can hit all the notes

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.970 
really means you can hit all the notes
of<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.299> chord<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.809> either<00:00:10.259> bring<00:00:10.410> them<00:00:10.559> up<00:00:10.740> or

of a chord and either bring them up or
down<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.339> pitch<00:00:11.549> and<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> tracks<00:00:12.059> incredibly

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:12.839 
down in pitch and it tracks incredibly

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.440 
down in pitch and it tracks incredibly
well<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.589> turn<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.339> bring<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.269> toe

well to turn it on you bring the toe
down<00:00:15.629> like<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> same<00:00:16.620> thing<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
down like that and the same thing to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
down like that and the same thing to
turn<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> off<00:00:17.310> I've<00:00:17.910> got<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.810> Jack<00:00:19.050> there

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
turn it off I've got a little Jack there

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
turn it off I've got a little Jack there
on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.190> input<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:20.700> to<00:00:20.910> remind<00:00:21.210> me<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
don't forget that on the left hand side

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.150 
don't forget that on the left hand side
here<00:00:29.640> you've<00:00:29.790> got<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:29.970> calibrate<00:00:30.540> function

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
here you've got a calibrate function

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.919 
here you've got a calibrate function
boom<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.179> enables<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.780> is

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
boom and what that enables you to do is

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.450 
boom and what that enables you to do is
to<00:00:34.109> set<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> pitch<00:00:34.710> shift<00:00:35.039> so<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> either

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to set the pitch shift so it either

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
to set the pitch shift so it either
happens<00:00:35.699> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> bring<00:00:36.179> the<00:00:36.300> heel<00:00:36.480> back<00:00:36.690> or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
happens when you bring the heel back or

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
happens when you bring the heel back or
the<00:00:37.769> pitch<00:00:37.920> shift<00:00:38.160> happens<00:00:38.519> when<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> bring

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the pitch shift happens when you bring

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
the pitch shift happens when you bring
it<00:00:38.999> into<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> flat<00:00:39.420> position<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.649> cool

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it into the flat position very cool

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.729 
it into the flat position very cool
functionality<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:42.149> also<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.230> side<00:00:43.499> here

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
functionality now also on this side here

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
functionality now also on this side here
you've<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.249> drive<00:00:44.550> volume<00:00:44.969> control

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you've got the drive volume control

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.729 
you've got the drive volume control
which<00:00:45.420> basically<00:00:45.780> allows<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> blend<00:00:46.499> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
which basically allows you to blend in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
which basically allows you to blend in
or<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> direct<00:00:47.850> signal<00:00:47.999> and<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
or out the direct signal and this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.899 
or out the direct signal and this
controls<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.409> range<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.429> much<00:00:50.640> pitch

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
controls the range of how much pitch

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.430 
controls the range of how much pitch
shift<00:00:51.149> you're<00:00:51.269> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.600> either<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.260> or

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
shift you're going to have either up or

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
shift you're going to have either up or
down<00:00:52.589> depending<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.159> where<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.850> button<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
down depending on where this button is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.149 
down depending on where this button is
pushed<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.319> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> other<00:00:55.469> interesting

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
pushed now one of the other interesting

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.799 
pushed now one of the other interesting
things<00:00:56.399> about<00:00:56.519> this<00:00:56.760> pedal<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.629> doesn't

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
things about this pedal is it doesn't

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.989 
things about this pedal is it doesn't
use<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> traditional<00:00:58.379> pot<00:00:59.069> to<00:00:59.550> control<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
use a traditional pot to control the

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.340 
use a traditional pot to control the
pitch<00:01:00.179> so<00:01:00.420> basically<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:00.989> moving

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
pitch so basically you're just moving

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.049 
pitch so basically you're just moving
the<00:01:01.440> pedal<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.460> other<00:01:02.609> part<00:01:02.940> that's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the pedal not some other part that's

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
so for this next my I've gotten rid of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.510 
so for this next my I've gotten rid of
the<00:01:44.140> direct<00:01:44.440> signal<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:44.980> I've<00:01:45.070> pitched<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the direct signal and I've pitched the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.670 
the direct signal and I've pitched the
pedal<00:01:45.790> up<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.060> fifth<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.720> I've<00:01:46.900> added<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.380> the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
pedal up a fifth and I've added in the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:02:06.420 
pedal up a fifth and I've added in the
stereo<00:01:48.040> memory<00:01:48.490> man
