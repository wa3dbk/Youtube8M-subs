00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 earthly channel algeria this is what they 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.509
 have aired so we see there 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.370
 republic in blacy level in jean marc 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.440
 ayrault who talks with bouteflika a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 animated discussion we see them exchanging 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.950
 before the coct minister Algerian it is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.820
 badly but big news 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 prospect 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.789
 is that no less he ministers 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
 French prime minister so much 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.689
 on the side of the city you hands and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 all that is indeed Bouteflika looks 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 to discuss with hÃ©rault it moves that goes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.460
 but because there is one but we have this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 same sequence but without comment and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 without mounting the channel algeria channel 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 would she have a hair overused mounting 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 to make the president a little bit more 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 vigorous here is the sequence in his 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 completeness and we see a Bouteflika 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.340
 obviously very weakly motionless 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 except once here where they move after 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 the zoom where they give you one time 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.690
 twice and three times 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.260
 then they'll go on heroes screaming 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.329
 reacts very little to Bouteflika 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:10.200
 after getting back on Bouteflika 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:12.630
 still the secret of algeria channel they 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
 have multiple cameras and rebroadcast 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 several times the movements of the hand 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.619
 of Bouteflika but with angles 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.970
 different 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 like that we get the impression that they 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 discuss during plummets in the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.880
 sequence without mounting it moved the hand 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.640
 three times we counted we will recount 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.549
 and in the Algerian public channel jt 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.470
 abdelaziz bouteflika in the presence of elected officials 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.390
 to speed up the prime minister 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.190
 the trust operation between the two 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.620
 countries allow to open 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.380
 new perspectives not part 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.750
 fewer than nine ministers accompany the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 French prime minister in this five 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.420
 furnaces lacement six times this time the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.800
 eight times to energize Bouteflika did 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.690
 noticed that they have aired several 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.460
 times the same movement tomorrow but seen 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.110
 different angles examples this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 tight plane movement is the same as 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.260
 this one puts in wide plan it is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.510
 exactly the same 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.040
 broadcast both in the montage 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.570
 magic of editing 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.470
 they are there and yeah they are there everywhere 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.470
 all the time he's here you are we
