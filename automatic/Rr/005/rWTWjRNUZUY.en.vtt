00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it was just really painful and I'm just

it was just really painful and I'm just
like<00:01:47.070> super<00:01:47.520> paranoid<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:49.200> gonna

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like super paranoid that like it's gonna

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.469 
like super paranoid that like it's gonna
get<00:01:49.470> dirty<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.159> infected<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.060> I've<00:01:51.270> been

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
get dirty and infected so like I've been

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.260 
get dirty and infected so like I've been
using<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> mouth<00:01:52.439> rinse<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> use

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
using the mouth rinse I have to use

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
using the mouth rinse I have to use
alcohol<00:01:54.659> free<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.369> alcohol<00:01:56.969> then

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
alcohol free because if you alcohol then

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.100 
alcohol free because if you alcohol then
it<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:58.200> irritates<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it really irritates it and so this is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.730 
it really irritates it and so this is
