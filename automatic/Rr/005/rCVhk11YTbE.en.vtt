now<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.239> also<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.780> tall<00:02:39.989> tower

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
now would also be to get tall tower

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
now would also be to get tall tower
which<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.560> guessing<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.549> before<00:02:41.760> we're

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
which is guessing this before we're

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.850 
which is guessing this before we're
gonna<00:02:41.940> go<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.269> right<00:02:42.420> now<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:46.650> right

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
gonna go and do right now all right

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.020 
gonna go and do right now all right
let's<00:02:47.160> see

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.729 

sobbing<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.269> stand<00:02:54.480> again<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> gerund

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
sobbing to my stand again the gerund

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.809 
sobbing to my stand again the gerund
over

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
over

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.970 
over
oh<00:02:56.879> no<00:02:57.569> no<00:02:57.840> no<00:02:58.549> at<00:02:59.549> our<00:02:59.790> star<00:03:00.120> design

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.479 

all<00:03:04.370> right<00:03:04.790> now<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.330> was<00:03:05.659> pretty<00:03:05.900> close<00:03:06.489> so

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
all right now that was pretty close so

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.930 
all right now that was pretty close so
uh<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.680> very<00:03:09.799> funny<00:03:10.010> actually<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.819> was

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
uh that was very funny actually that was

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.289 
uh that was very funny actually that was
the<00:03:11.330> way<00:03:11.510> too<00:03:11.569> close<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.200> uh<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:13.120> hoped<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
the way too close and uh I hoped it

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.890 
the way too close and uh I hoped it
would<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:16.970> was<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.360> looking

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
would be just and that was just looking

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.780 
would be just and that was just looking
at<00:03:18.019> my<00:03:18.110> flesh<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.470> first<00:03:18.739> thing<00:03:18.920> all<00:03:19.640> right

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
at my flesh to the first thing all right

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.610 
at my flesh to the first thing all right
but<00:03:20.720> nonetheless<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.110> was<00:03:21.319> pretty<00:03:21.440> cool

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
but nonetheless that was pretty cool

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.100 
but nonetheless that was pretty cool
that<00:03:21.980> was<00:03:22.099> really<00:03:22.910> close<00:03:23.180> thousand<00:03:24.170> I've<00:03:24.290> said

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
that was really close thousand I've said

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.410 
that was really close thousand I've said
um<00:03:27.110> but<00:03:28.099> luckily<00:03:28.250> they<00:03:28.549> get<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.819> know<00:03:28.940> just

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
um but luckily they get you know just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.000 
um but luckily they get you know just
low<00:03:29.569> enough<00:03:29.599> HP<00:03:29.930> final<00:03:30.349> typical<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.799> mean<00:03:30.920> it

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
low enough HP final typical I mean it

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.390 
low enough HP final typical I mean it
was<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.489> bit<00:03:31.819> overkill<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.209> my<00:03:32.329> ultimate<00:03:32.660> as

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
was a bit overkill of my ultimate as

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.520 
was a bit overkill of my ultimate as
even<00:03:34.400> if<00:03:34.489> he<00:03:34.549> had<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:34.940> more<00:03:35.090> HP<00:03:35.209> she<00:03:36.079> still

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
even if he had a bit more HP she still

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.860 
even if he had a bit more HP she still
wanted<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.739> for<00:03:36.950> me<00:03:37.069> but<00:03:37.310> nonetheless

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
wanted that for me but nonetheless

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.600 
wanted that for me but nonetheless
pretty<00:03:38.870> cool<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.950> know<00:03:40.069> I<00:03:40.220> survived

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
pretty cool that you know I survived

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.130 
pretty cool that you know I survived
that<00:03:40.790> poured<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.599> game<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.780> looking

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
that poured so this game is looking

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
that poured so this game is looking
pretty<00:03:45.230> good<00:03:47.530> maybe<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.620> should<00:03:48.709> stop<00:03:48.859> in<00:03:48.980> 5

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
pretty good maybe I should stop in 5

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.110 
pretty good maybe I should stop in 5
you're<00:03:49.280> 5<00:03:49.340> games<00:03:49.640> because<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:49.849> seem<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.090> be

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
you're 5 games because I seem to be

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.229 
you're 5 games because I seem to be
winning<00:03:50.390> 35<00:03:50.840> s<00:03:50.930> pretty<00:03:51.079> often<00:03:51.700> usually<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
winning 35 s pretty often usually is the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:07.340 
winning 35 s pretty often usually is the
solo<00:03:53.450> q<00:03:53.690> I'm<00:03:53.810> having<00:03:54.079> trouble<00:03:54.170> with

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.580 

that<00:04:07.980> was<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> pretty<00:04:08.340> unfortunate<00:04:08.940> i<00:04:09.870> know

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that was a pretty unfortunate i know

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.010 
that was a pretty unfortunate i know
that<00:04:10.860> skill<00:04:11.040> culver<00:04:11.280> he<00:04:11.340> goes<00:04:11.460> into<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.700> lake

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
that skill culver he goes into the lake

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.600 
that skill culver he goes into the lake
because<00:04:13.020> he<00:04:13.230> got<00:04:13.320> stunts<00:04:13.650> asking<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.430> he

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
because he got stunts asking so he

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.040 
because he got stunts asking so he
basically<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.940> wasted<00:04:15.360> information<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.900> it

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.050 
basically just wasted information on it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:25.250 
basically just wasted information on it
so<00:04:16.260> i<00:04:17.390> guess<00:04:18.390> he's<00:04:18.600> actually<00:04:18.780> home<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:25.140> yeah

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so i guess he's actually home but yeah

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.630 
so i guess he's actually home but yeah
he<00:04:25.350> was<00:04:25.470> also<00:04:25.560> hoping<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.010> escape<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.430> stunt

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
he was also hoping to escape the stunt

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.030 
he was also hoping to escape the stunt
in<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.760> first<00:04:26.970> place<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:27.600> like<00:04:28.380> i<00:04:28.500> said<00:04:28.530> i<00:04:28.860> was

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
in the first place but like i said i was

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.530 
in the first place but like i said i was
pretty<00:04:29.190> unfortunate<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.820> how<00:04:30.000> he<00:04:30.090> got<00:04:30.210> snot

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
pretty unfortunate of how he got snot

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.410 
pretty unfortunate of how he got snot
through<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> that's<00:04:32.700> what<00:04:32.820> we<00:04:32.910> end<00:04:33.060> up<00:04:33.090> killing

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
through so that's what we end up killing

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.760 
through so that's what we end up killing
him<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.660> there<00:04:33.810> was<00:04:33.900> nothing<00:04:34.170> he<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:34.500> once

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
him and there was nothing he can do once

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.890 
him and there was nothing he can do once
my<00:04:34.950> sounds<00:04:35.280> got<00:04:35.460> off<00:04:35.610> on<00:04:35.790> him<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.690> i'm<00:04:36.750> guessing

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
my sounds got off on him so i'm guessing

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.860 
my sounds got off on him so i'm guessing
there<00:04:37.140> might<00:04:37.230> be<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:37.500> bush<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:38.700> there<00:04:38.970> ok

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
there might be in this bush is there ok

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.030 
there might be in this bush is there ok
so<00:04:39.930> there's<00:04:40.170> no<00:04:40.290> he's<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.710> public<00:04:40.980> Tribune

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
so there's no he's in a public Tribune

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.580 
so there's no he's in a public Tribune
