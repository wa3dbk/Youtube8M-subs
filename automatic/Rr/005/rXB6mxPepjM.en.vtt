00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.629
Vsauce, I’m Jake and recently I’ve been
playing a lot of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.019
which takes place on a Lunar colony that has
similar characteristics to our own moon. And

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.019
it got me thinking about how mankind has always
dreamed of colonizing the moon. Back in 1638

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.570
Bishop John Wilkins wrote about future humanity
living on the moon. In the 1950s and 60s the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.220
US Government created numerous proposals detailing
just that like the US Army’s Project Horizon

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.870
in 1959 which outlined a military base on
the Moon by 1966. Or the US Air Force’s

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.030
Lunex Project to create an underground air
force base. And in 2006 NASA proposed to build

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.980
a lunar outpost by 2024.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.600
But what if we actually did...what would it
be like on Earth’s only natural satellite...”What

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.020
if We Lived on the Moon?”

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.829
One of the first things you’d notice is
the Sun and how it would be white. Because

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.129
there is only an extremely thin layer of gas
surrounding the Moon, an exosphere, there

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.610
is no real atmosphere to absorb and scatter
sunlight… which is also the reason why the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.700
lunar sky is just black. You’d also have
a hard time seeing any stars since the Sun

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.270
is so much brighter than they are. It is the
reason why there are no visible stars in the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.640
background of photos from the Apollo missions.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.490
A lunar day would be a lot longer, as well.
It would last 29 Earth days with 14.5 of them

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.850
being in sunshine and 14.5 in darkness. And
even though the Moon and Earth are pretty

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.030
equal in terms of distance to the sun, the
lack of atmosphere on the Moon means that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.190
the temperatures would change dramatically
- going from 240 degrees F during the day

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.400
to -280 degrees F at night. And then there
are parts of the Moon where it’s perpetually

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.060
dark.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.630
Deep craters around the poles may never see
sunlight and the coldest temperature ever

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.840
recorded in our Solar System so far was inside
one of them, the Hermite crater, at - 413

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.360
degrees Fahrenheit. The coldest natural recording
on Earth was in Antarctica at -135.8 degrees.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.360
It is thought that within these craters there
is water ice which would allow us to get H20

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.940
directly from the moon instead of the incredible
cost of having it sent from Earth.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.280
On the opposite side of the spectrum are parts
of the Moon that are exposed to direct sunlight

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.500
over 80% of the time. These extremely long
hours of daylight and darkness would not only

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.350
put us out of sync with the Earth, but could
mess with our bodies. Midnight suns can cause

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.890
sleep disturbance, hyperactivity, fatigue,
and irritable moods; whereas polar nights

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.810
can lead to feelings of sadness, lack of energy,
difficulty concentrating, difficulty staying

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.700
awake and cravings for carbohydrates.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.450
Since we’d be on a different time than the
citizens of Earth, we’d need a way to keep

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.450
track of it. In 1970 Astronomer Kenneth L.
Franklin created a watch for people who visited

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.480
the moon. It told time in “lunations”
which were equal to 29.5 Earth days.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.230
If you didn’t have a moon watch, another
way to tell time would be by using the cycles

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.910
of the Earth’s phases. Just like how we
used the Moon’s to create a lunar calendar,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.920
we could use the Earth to create a calendar
for the moon. Since both celestial bodies

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.740
are tidally locked to each other, we would
see all phases of the Earth in one full Lunar

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.740
day and it would look something like this…

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.310
The Earth is almost 4 times bigger than the
Moon, so during an eclipse the sun becomes

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.310
makes a red ring around the Earth 
for hours…

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.819
Besides the effects the long days and nights
would have on us mentally, the difference

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.370
in gravity would change us physically. We
know that the human body in microgravity causes

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.030
bone loss, and the wasting away or atrophy
of muscles. Luckily the moon has 1/6th the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.030
gravity of Earth, so you’d not only be able
to lift a small cow but these effects on your

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.190
body would happen less quickly than say to
the astronauts on the International Space

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.710
Station...but one of the benefits of being
on the ISS is that you age less.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.590
After 6 months on the ISS, the astronauts
are .0007 seconds younger than if they had

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.540
stayed on Earth. However, on the Moon you
would age faster. Einstein said that “time

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.430
is a river”. It can speed up at certain
points and slow down at others. Because of

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.410
time dilation, time would be going faster
on the Moon so if you stayed there for a year

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.820
you’d be .002 seconds older than on Earth
and after 80 years you’d be .16 seconds

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.650
older. Also there are the doses of radiation
you’d be blasted with because of the whole

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.320
no atmosphere thing. So why not make an atmosphere
on the moon?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.010
The big issues would be the solar wind that
would slowly whisk it away and according to

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.040
the Hoekzema Study, that looked into creating
a Lunar atmosphere, it would take about a

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.850
century to create one that was stable...however
it wouldn’t be breathable at a pressure

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.139
one ten-millionth that of the one on Earth’s
surface. It would actually be the same as

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.010
the Karman line, the altitude at which “outer
space” technically begins. Even if we could

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.830
create a breathable atmosphere on the Moon,
it would only last for 100 years until it’d

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.470
need to be replenished.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.169
So we’d have to stick to space suits and
bio-domes for our moon adventures and not

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.990
have a breathable atmosphere. The silver lining
to all of this though would be climbing the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.990
moon’s highest point, which at 35,328 feet
makes it 6,299ft taller than Everest, and

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.560
firing a tank. Why fire a tank you ask? Because
the bullet you just shot would then orbit

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.550
the moon. Just be sure to move out of the
way an hour and 49 minutes later when it comes

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.280
back around...and as always, thanks for watching.
