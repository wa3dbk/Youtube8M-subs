it's been a fantastic year for
strawberries<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:18.949> I've<00:00:19.949> been<00:00:20.130> making

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
strawberries and I've been making

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.439 
strawberries and I've been making
strawberry<00:00:21.090> wine<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.180> time

strawberry wine and it's the first time

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.259 
strawberry wine and it's the first time
I've<00:00:24.570> done<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> I've<00:00:26.609> noticed<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
I've done it and I've noticed that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.540 
I've done it and I've noticed that
there's<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.900> basic<00:00:28.439> ways<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.890> making<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
there's two basic ways of making it the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.120 
there's two basic ways of making it the
first<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:34.410> chop<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.980> your

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
first way is to chop all your

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.959 
first way is to chop all your
strawberries<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:38.790> sugar

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
strawberries up and then put some sugar

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.590 
strawberries up and then put some sugar
with<00:00:39.270> them<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> let<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> marinade<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
with them and let the marinade for a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740 
with them and let the marinade for a
couple<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.960> days<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.210> then<00:00:45.210> drain<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
couple of days and then drain off the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.240 
couple of days and then drain off the
liquid<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:48.530> put<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> damage<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:52.250> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
liquid and put it in the damage on and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.430 
liquid and put it in the damage on and
then<00:00:54.090> add<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.899> liquid<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
then add some more liquid to the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.490 
then add some more liquid to the
strawberry<00:00:58.440> pulp<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> drain<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.140> again

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
strawberry pulp and drain that off again

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.770 
strawberry pulp and drain that off again
and<00:01:02.370> add<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> damage<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.460> then

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
and add that to the damage on and then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.910 
and add that to the damage on and then
add<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> yeast<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.290> citric<00:01:10.290> acid<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
add the yeast and citric acid and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.359 
add the yeast and citric acid and
whatever<00:01:11.790> else<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
whatever else you want to put in it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.289 
whatever else you want to put in it
now<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> would<00:01:15.359> say<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> best<00:01:15.899> way

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
now that I would say is the best way

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.219 
now that I would say is the best way
because<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.539> second<00:01:18.960> way<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> chop<00:01:22.109> up

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
because the second way is you chop up

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.819 
because the second way is you chop up
all<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.560> strawberries<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> put<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.679> in

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
all these strawberries and put it in

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
all these strawberries and put it in
your<00:01:25.939> formation<00:01:27.289> fermentation<00:01:28.289> vessel<00:01:30.049> with

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
your formation fermentation vessel with

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
your formation fermentation vessel with
the<00:01:31.200> sugar<00:01:31.530> under<00:01:32.369> yeast<00:01:32.789> and<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:35.030> Peck

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the sugar under yeast and the Peck

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
the sugar under yeast and the Peck
delays<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.209> things<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
delays and other things and then you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.590 
delays and other things and then you
drain<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.819> problem<00:01:45.359> with<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
drain it off now the problem with the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.529 
drain it off now the problem with the
second<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> pulp<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:51.299> then

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
second way is that the pulp is then

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.449 
second way is that the pulp is then
useless<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.329> first<00:01:54.599> way<00:01:55.340> where<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
useless but with the first way where you

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.209 
useless but with the first way where you
haven't<00:01:56.789> had<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> yeast<00:01:57.860> you've<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.069> this

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
haven't had it the yeast you've got this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.149 
haven't had it the yeast you've got this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
with the with the sugar will act as a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.830 
with the with the sugar will act as a
preservative<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.669> it<00:03:15.120> won't<00:03:15.329> have<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.569> much

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
preservative and it won't have very much

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800 
preservative and it won't have very much
yeast<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.549> coming<00:03:18.090> natural<00:03:18.630> yeast

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
yeast in it so you coming natural yeast

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.240 
yeast in it so you coming natural yeast
so<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.230> mean<00:03:19.650> keep<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.250> fridge

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
so I mean keep it in the fridge

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.420 
so I mean keep it in the fridge
so<00:03:21.850> that's<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.270> big<00:03:22.480> bonus<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.680> first

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
so that's a big bonus with the first

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.820 
so that's a big bonus with the first
method<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.680> making<00:03:26.970> strawberry<00:03:27.970> wine<00:03:28.680> as<00:03:29.680> you
