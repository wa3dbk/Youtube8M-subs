00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
got a hooked up to the connector on the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
got a hooked up to the connector on the
display<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.119> detecting<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.720> signal<00:00:30.929> but

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
let's open up the radar as an example

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
let's open up the radar as an example
here<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.560> what's<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.189> here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
to get pretty much the same thing that

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.830 
to get pretty much the same thing that
you<00:01:50.790> had<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.360> other<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.630> where<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.810> says

connected to TV I'm guessing you know

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.800 
connected to TV I'm guessing you know
but<00:01:53.729> he's<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> take<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.659> extra

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but he's going to take some extra

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
but he's going to take some extra
processing<00:01:55.259> power<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.520> sure<00:01:56.670> why

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
processing power and I'm not sure why

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
processing power and I'm not sure why
you<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> watch<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.719> TV<00:01:57.780> and

looks like so pretty cool setup so this
is<00:02:16.620> video<00:02:16.829> mirroring<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.909> iPad<00:02:18.420> 2

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

laptop you plug this into a display you

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.039 
laptop you plug this into a display you
know<00:02:26.129> basically<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.609> show<00:02:27.090> off<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.810> web
