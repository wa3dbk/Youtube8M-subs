00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.290
 because the shoulders that the body does not 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.690
 they are nothing because nothing can be 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.260
 done, that's what I do 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.319
 second because 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.959
 Just when I'm going to try to turn on the lights. 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.300

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.889
 do not think why fat cats are so 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.810
 great that I have a huge shame 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.389
 to show you 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.310

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.949

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:49.710

 So good, no, no, I 'm not little. 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:01.860
 It's good what happened most this week. 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.719
 I think to think I do not do 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.819
 A lot of things in life are kind of sad. 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:08.819
 I think this has a project I have 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:12.150
 will actually pnpg and gets kinda 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:15.090
 strong but I can not even find the good 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.090
 the good ones do not even hold me to pay great 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:29.360
 a team lost the ramp online never think 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:33.449
 that'm closed cry to turn in bed 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.099
 but let me think if I bought some 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.599
 interesting thing not to spend 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:44.610
 money full of money in a poor 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:46.050
 nothing interesting is this to start with 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.930
 I want it to be one more book 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.479
 look at my bookstore cafe there is even 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:59.759
 I did not mention the book I read this one and 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:06:06.839
 mega landres but it's too dark 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:09.689
 I came here to here to get the crowd 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:12.839
 this book here tells the story of 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.029
 a single type in the full enchanted city 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.279
 The magic of hell is expensive the ruins 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.500
 and people saw a bis 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.210
 technically a bis 1 like others 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.789
 people but they do not die 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.389
 only they too dude is kind of crazy and it 's 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.260
 cool 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.060
 only that it is time consuming is it 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.940
 time to kill things unfold 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.120

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.400

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.310

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.630
 directed side is already being filmed and 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.970
 traction is because the animation will be 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.280
 in this pizza animation will be the 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.340
 the kinematics of the breeze that 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.200
 is already and it seems that you do not 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.920
 like the truth, I want it to be fierce 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.080
 I want it to be a lot of rock and that's it. 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.360

 many videos as I would like to 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.180
 forgive me for that, but 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.210
