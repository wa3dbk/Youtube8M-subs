[Music]

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.529
Think of visiting the Czech Republic and most
people think of Prague: Wenceslas Square,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:21.160
Old Town Square, the lovely Charles Bridge
over the Vltava, the Cathedral of St Vitus.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.949
But I promise you the countryside is even
more beautiful.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.930
My name is Michaela, I am Czech, and I am
out in the countryside every day. I live near

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.089
Prague. But today I am in České Budějovice
looking for wild boar.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:53.659
It’s another day, another morning in a forest,
and we are just about to walk to a spot where

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.820
possibly we could see some wild boar. So,
we have got to be quiet, and walk slowly,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.200
and we will see what will happen. Wish us
luck!

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.990
After a few minutes I reach a highseat and
settle down in it. The birdsong is awesome.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.800
Wild boar are so shy, this is the best way
to hunt them in the summer.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.530
Well the morning hunt wasn’t successful-
we did not see anything - but this is hunting

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.320
so we keep going.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.930
The next day, I want to try for a roebuck.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.850
We are just in a tree stand, me and my cameraman.
We have a horrible sun. It is shining straight

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.260
into our eyes. There is an old deer, so we
will wait. If he comes closer then we will

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.780
shoot him. Because it is an old one.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.070
Unlike the shy wild boar, we see plenty of
deer. But they are super wary too.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.210
It seems like he has gone.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.630
A doe that is peacefully grazing in front
of us suddenly looks up and straight at us.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.280
She knows there is something there. She can’t
scent us or see us, but the slightest sound

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.109
is enough to make her nervous. We hold very,
very still, and soon her head goes down and

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.950
she is grazing again.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.670
At last my buck shows up. Getting on to him
is more of a struggle for my cameraman than

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.490
me.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.319
[Gunshot]

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.999
We got out first roe deer.

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.879
Phew - yeah.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.879
[Laughs]

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.689
Got him.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.689
[Laughs]

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.510
Awesome. Awesome!

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.630
I am really pleased and walk over with my
stalker and my camera team to find him. You

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.980
can see why it was so difficult for all of
us to keep quiet.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:12.879
This deer is, like, five or six years old.
You can see beautiful antlers. It is a really,

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.379
really nice buck.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:22.319
We are quite formal in the Czech Republic
and we really like tradition. The stalker

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.150
performs a ceremony he does with every deer
successfully hunted on this land.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.239
So if you are wondering what we are doing
- what this branch means - it is the last

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.140
honour, which we do here in Central Europe.
Our tradition - and it is, like, a last honour

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:52.930
for game. So, this is what we do - we honour
game with a last meal - we call it 'the last

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:02.090
meal' - and it’s a tradition of Central
Europe. Another one goes into my hat and it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.769
means I was successful today. I was a successful
hunter, and I can leave it until I go to sleep,

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.059
and if I go somewhere, other hunters can see
I was successful because they will see the

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:20.900
branches in my hat. That is why.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
Now I am officially a successful hunter for
today. Awesome.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.060
It has been a wonderful day. I am lucky enough
to travel all over the world hunting but the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.740
Czech Republic is still my favourite place.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.419
We were in an area. We tried to walk and stalk.
We chased away one nice buck. Then we decided

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:55.360
to sit for a while and we got this awesome
deer. So a perfect evening, I think.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.960
If you would like to find out more about hunting
in my country, you can find the TopJagd company

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.729
who gave me this awesome buck. And if you
