six games and we've only accumulated

more or less on par is that an

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
assessment you agree with no I think

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
assessment you agree with no I think
with<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> squad<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> we've<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> think

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
with the squad that we've got I think

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
with the squad that we've got I think
we've<00:01:51.990> underperformed<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> year<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
we've underperformed this year and I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.069 
we've underperformed this year and I
think<00:01:53.759> most<00:01:53.939> Norwich<00:01:54.240> City<00:01:54.479> supporters<00:01:54.960> would

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
think most Norwich City supporters would

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.450 
think most Norwich City supporters would
say<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.560> haven't<00:01:55.740> played<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.399> as

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
say that we haven't played as well as

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.690 
say that we haven't played as well as
they<00:01:57.030> expected<00:01:57.689> us<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> year<00:01:58.439> either<00:01:59.369> by

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
they expected us to this year either by

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.249 
they expected us to this year either by
way<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> performances<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.899> indeed<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
way of performances or indeed the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
way of performances or indeed the
results<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.829> we've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.810> think

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
results that we've got and so we think

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
results that we've got and so we think
we're<00:02:04.259> below<00:02:04.500> par<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.979> year<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.850> do

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
we're below par this year we do

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
we're below par this year we do

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.309 
the in the short term we do think that
things<00:03:29.790> haven't<00:03:30.150> been<00:03:30.239> working<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.049> we<00:03:31.169> need

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
things haven't been working so we need

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.050 
things haven't been working so we need
to<00:03:31.379> make<00:03:31.530> some<00:03:31.680> changes<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.699> we've<00:03:32.879> made<00:03:33.000> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to make some changes so we've made that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.509 
to make some changes so we've made that
change<00:03:33.419> at<00:03:33.900> managerial<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.799> coaching<00:03:35.220> level

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
change at managerial and coaching level

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.699 
change at managerial and coaching level
so<00:03:35.879> that's<00:03:36.000> important<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.840> we<00:03:37.169> would<00:03:37.409> expect

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
so that's important and we would expect

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.589 
so that's important and we would expect
Neill<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.250> put<00:03:38.549> his<00:03:38.639> own<00:03:38.819> stamp<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.359> his<00:03:39.389> own

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
Neill to put his own stamp in his own

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.800 
Neill to put his own stamp in his own

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
to six weeks five games of the season so

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.659 
to six weeks five games of the season so
we<00:03:46.440> would<00:03:46.560> expect<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.889> see<00:03:47.010> some<00:03:47.280> changes

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
we would expect to see some changes

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.729 
we would expect to see some changes
perhaps<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.209> wholesale<00:03:48.629> changes<00:03:49.079> but<00:03:49.620> there

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
perhaps not wholesale changes but there

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.649 
perhaps not wholesale changes but there
might<00:03:49.859> be<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:50.040> subtle<00:03:50.400> ones<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.359> think

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
might be a subtle ones that we think

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.659 
might be a subtle ones that we think
could<00:03:52.079> be<00:03:52.260> enough<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.470> make<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.829> significant

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
could be enough to make a significant

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.229 
could be enough to make a significant
difference

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
difference

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.509

enter these final five games well we
just<00:04:12.930> firstly<00:04:13.769> we<00:04:13.889> won't<00:04:14.069> be<00:04:14.220> able<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.579> as

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
just firstly we won't be able to do as

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.159 
just firstly we won't be able to do as
well<00:04:14.819> as<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.090> possibly<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.629> and<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.930> means

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
well as you possibly can and that means

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.560 
well as you possibly can and that means
ensuring<00:04:16.970> firstly<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.239> stay<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
league position so the expectations are

for us to to garner enough points to
achieve<00:04:25.320> both<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.950> those<00:04:26.070> aims

achieve both of those aims

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.570 
achieve both of those aims
follows<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> most<00:04:28.740> important<00:04:29.160> game<00:04:29.340> because

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
follows the most important game because

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.000 
follows the most important game because
it's<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.910> next<00:04:30.090> game<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:31.530> course<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
it's the next game and of course the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.680 
it's the next game and of course the
four<00:04:32.400> teams<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.790> we<00:04:32.910> play<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.360> running

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
four teams that we play in the running

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.800 
four teams that we play in the running
are<00:04:33.840> huge<00:04:34.700> giants<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.820> world<00:04:36.120> football<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.780> we

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
are huge giants of world football so we

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.390 
are huge giants of world football so we
understand<00:04:37.410> how<00:04:37.560> difficult<00:04:37.980> those<00:04:38.070> are<00:04:38.250> going

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
understand how difficult those are going

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.150 
understand how difficult those are going
to<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:39.050> but<00:04:40.050> we've<00:04:40.200> done<00:04:40.350> pretty<00:04:40.500> well<00:04:40.650> against

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
to be but we've done pretty well against

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.040 
to be but we've done pretty well against
some<00:04:41.400> pretty<00:04:41.910> big<00:04:42.120> teams<00:04:42.330> over<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.660> course<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
some pretty big teams over the course of

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.440 
some pretty big teams over the course of
the<00:04:43.110> last<00:04:43.260> two<00:04:44.070> years<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.030> we'd<00:04:45.240> like<00:04:45.270> to

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
the last two years and so we'd like to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.600 
the last two years and so we'd like to
hope<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.260> we<00:04:46.500> will<00:04:46.919> be<00:04:46.950> able<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.220> get<00:04:47.400> some

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
hope that we will be able to get some

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.640 
hope that we will be able to get some
points<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.480> those<00:04:48.660> remaining<00:04:49.020> four<00:04:49.260> games<00:04:49.470> of

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
points in those remaining four games of

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.830 
points in those remaining four games of
the<00:04:49.680> season<00:04:49.919> well<00:04:50.850> I<00:04:50.880> think<00:04:51.240> it's<00:04:51.419> always<00:04:51.630> sad

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
the season well I think it's always sad

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.150 
the season well I think it's always sad
when<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.110> make<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.410> change<00:04:52.650> because<00:04:52.950> it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
when you make that change because it

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.650 
when you make that change because it
means<00:04:53.280> people<00:04:53.639> are<00:04:53.700> losing<00:04:54.030> their<00:04:54.180> jobs

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
means people are losing their jobs

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.720 
means people are losing their jobs
