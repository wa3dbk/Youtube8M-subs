then for all you Raptor owners we do a
three-inch<00:01:56.170> internal<00:01:56.920> bypass<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
three-inch internal bypass this is the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.510 
three-inch internal bypass this is the
same<00:01:58.810> technology<00:01:59.380> used<00:01:59.560> on<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.890> OE<00:02:00.040> Ford

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
same technology used on the OE Ford

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.890 
same technology used on the OE Ford
Raptor<00:02:00.759> but<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.300> three-inch

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
Raptor but in the three-inch

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.540 
Raptor but in the three-inch
with<00:02:02.409> or<00:02:02.590> without<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.070> dual<00:02:03.280> speed

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
with or without the dual speed

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.490 
with or without the dual speed
compression<00:02:04.060> adjusters<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.690> then<00:02:05.170> we<00:02:05.320> go<00:02:05.470> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
compression adjusters and then we go to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.419 
compression adjusters and then we go to
a<00:02:05.649> full-on<00:02:06.009> race<00:02:06.520> bypass<00:02:07.509> three<00:02:08.410> two<00:02:08.679> fully

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
a full-on race bypass three two fully

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.780 
a full-on race bypass three two fully
adjustable<00:02:10.119> ready<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.230> roll<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:12.520> out<00:02:12.580> there

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
adjustable ready to roll go out there

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.820 
adjustable ready to roll go out there
and<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.000> fun<00:02:13.030> enjoy<00:02:13.450> your<00:02:13.720> car<00:02:13.900> okay<00:02:14.560> mark<00:02:14.770> so

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and have fun enjoy your car okay mark so

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.290 
and have fun enjoy your car okay mark so
what's<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.190> point<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.760> reservoir<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
what's the point of the reservoir on the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.990 
what's the point of the reservoir on the
shocks<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.959> oil<00:02:17.170> capacity<00:02:17.550> cooling<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> big

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
shocks the oil capacity cooling is a big

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630 
shocks the oil capacity cooling is a big
factor<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.840> how<00:02:20.050> quickly<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.500> shock<00:02:20.739> fades<00:02:21.070> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
factor in how quickly a shock fades the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880 
factor in how quickly a shock fades the
more<00:02:21.880> oil<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.269> carry<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.959> less<00:02:23.230> effect<00:02:23.739> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
more oil you carry the less effect you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.310 
more oil you carry the less effect you
have<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.700> having<00:02:25.300> something<00:02:25.690> that's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
have of it so having something that's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.070 
have of it so having something that's
full<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.590> oil<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.550> divider<00:02:27.880> piston<00:02:28.420> allows

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
full of oil to the divider piston allows

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.979 
full of oil to the divider piston allows
which<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> good<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.640> having<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:31.239> shock

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
which is a good thing but having a shock

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.840 
which is a good thing but having a shock
full<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.440> oil<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> way<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.459> reservoir

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
full of oil all the way to the reservoir

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.430 
full of oil all the way to the reservoir
just<00:02:34.090> gives<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> increases<00:02:35.050> our<00:02:35.170> capacity

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
just gives it increases our capacity

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.270 
just gives it increases our capacity
which<00:02:36.280> allows<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.820> more

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
which allows you more

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.410 
which allows you more
perfect<00:02:38.150> brother

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
perfect brother

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.990 
perfect brother
