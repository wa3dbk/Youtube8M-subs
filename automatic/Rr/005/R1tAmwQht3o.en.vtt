Xbox come on chat ps3 video and they'll

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.540 
Xbox come on chat ps3 video and they'll
be<00:03:43.319> able<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> do<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.740> because<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.069> game<00:03:44.280> is

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
be able to do it because the game is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.610 
be able to do it because the game is
probably<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.090> would<00:03:45.300> imagine<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.410> be

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
probably I would imagine going to be

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.410 
probably I would imagine going to be
almost<00:03:46.800> identical<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.060> probably

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
almost identical and that's probably

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.400 
almost identical and that's probably
going<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> little<00:03:49.080> bit<00:03:49.260> different

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
going to be a little bit different

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.710 
going to be a little bit different
coming<00:03:49.860> on<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> ps4<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.520> Xbox<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.270> know

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
coming on the ps4 and Xbox one you know

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.030 
coming on the ps4 and Xbox one you know
because<00:03:51.959> they<00:03:52.080> have<00:03:52.170> accelerated<00:03:52.620> hardware

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
because they have accelerated hardware

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.199 
because they have accelerated hardware
right<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.340> game<00:03:53.520> will<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.850> probably

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
right the game will be probably

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.180 
right the game will be probably
legitimately<00:03:54.720> different<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.980> know<00:03:56.070> you'll

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
legitimately different you know you'll

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.590 
legitimately different you know you'll
probably<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.580> further<00:03:56.790> render<00:03:57.209> distance

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
probably have a further render distance

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.760 
probably have a further render distance
maybe<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.930> graphics<00:03:58.260> will<00:03:58.350> be<00:03:58.440> better<00:03:58.590> right

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
maybe the graphics will be better right

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.160 
maybe the graphics will be better right
the<00:03:58.920> game<00:03:59.130> will<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.459> different<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> will

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
the game will be different but it will

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.690 
the game will be different but it will
probably<00:04:01.380> still<00:04:01.830> be<00:04:01.860> on<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.100> same<00:04:02.250> update<00:04:02.580> I

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
probably still be on the same update I

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.030 
probably still be on the same update I
know<00:04:02.760> that's<00:04:03.000> hard<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.240> explain<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.620> that's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
know that's hard to explain and that's

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.080 
know that's hard to explain and that's
really<00:04:05.220> not<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.459> bridge<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.820> we<00:04:05.910> need<00:04:06.030> to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
really not a bridge that we need to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.370 
really not a bridge that we need to
cross<00:04:06.239> because<00:04:06.510> we're<00:04:06.630> not<00:04:06.720> there<00:04:06.870> yet<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.260> as

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
cross because we're not there yet but as

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.530 
cross because we're not there yet but as
