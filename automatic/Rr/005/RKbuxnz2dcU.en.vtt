 modes of mind and in today's video 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.370
 we will make another special edition of a 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.160
 game that has many possibilities 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.349
 I never said that I was going to dial kiss kiss 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.480
 To talk about joy with your beret. 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.939
 maybe any game gets more 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.390
 funny with the superhero template 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.390
 will be 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:51.480
 and the other was higher total beach walk 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.110
 I was the Passil now took me there I will 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.329
 over there 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.490
 besides batman we also have a template of the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:10.280
 Hulk 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:13.710
 and even the mold of the go or less good vague 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.440
 elder scrolls 5 scare is a medieval game 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.800
 pretty violent realistic I forgot to 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.960
 word of fucking demented whore 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.690
 now imagine if the dreaded dragons 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.690
 replaced by small ponies 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.560
 it is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 This reminded me of the biggest 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.290
 opponent who passed in the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.580
 tram and company were mobilized 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.970
 several you can imagine 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.490
 Imagine only the mod that adds laughter to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.320
 background when you miss something 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 When you get sick in the game. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.220
 some background laughter equal to that of the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.930
 Do you know that laugh? 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.240
 keys electronics 15 rooms 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.770
 when you miss 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:37.140
 something like now I said earlier and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:40.200
 if it hurts in the game until it exists 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.300
 and if someone has it there, create a 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 same laughing cast that passed 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 now in the video also did not want a 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.140
 a lot of laughter more with the laughter of the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.000
 The keys that I said please follow me on 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 twitter there and my life says send the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.160

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 mold and put the move on the game 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.320
 challenge 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.840
 fat pays good and since the spider man 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.640

 also replacing the spiders of the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.599
 Play for a rough and spider man 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.080
 to help 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.690
 they also want to have many modes with 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.269
 famous characters like this who 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:04:01.220

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.359

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.100
 which replaces the transformation of 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:05:09.980
 werewolf for nothing less than 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:09.980
 a chair a man chair 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.220
