00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
on few points one was a space there

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.940 
on few points one was a space there
capping<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.460> all<00:01:55.700> about<00:01:56.300> spaciousness<00:01:57.050> we<00:01:57.680> try

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
capping is all about spaciousness we try

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.969 
capping is all about spaciousness we try
to<00:01:58.060> remove<00:01:59.060> any<00:01:59.240> connection<00:01:59.750> between<00:01:59.979> the

the other really interesting thing about

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.449 
the other really interesting thing about
that<00:02:20.500> because<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.010> technology<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:22.230> actually

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that because the technology is actually

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.460 
that because the technology is actually
hidden<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.940> not<00:02:25.150> ostentatious<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.319> know

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
functionality displayed on the center it

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.809 
functionality displayed on the center it
it's<00:02:32.560> hidden<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.010> interact<00:02:33.400> with<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.640> car
