you<00:02:34.579> do<00:02:35.269> with<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.510> quilt<00:02:35.989> you're<00:02:36.350> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.560> do

you do with a quilt you're going to do

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.330 
you do with a quilt you're going to do
with<00:02:37.370> these<00:02:38.239> two<00:02:38.540> things<00:02:38.780> too<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.130> future

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
with these two things too in the future

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.890 
with these two things too in the future
I'll<00:02:43.519> make<00:02:43.700> some<00:02:43.850> videos<00:02:43.970> demonstrating

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
I'll make some videos demonstrating

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.190 
I'll make some videos demonstrating
needs<00:02:45.530> if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.799> guys<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> see<00:02:47.019> some<00:02:48.019> good

needs if you guys want to see some good

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.440 
needs if you guys want to see some good
exercises<00:02:49.130> with<00:02:49.280> these<00:02:49.459> give<00:02:49.760> me<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> thumbs<00:02:50.239> up

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
exercises with these give me a thumbs up

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.420 
exercises with these give me a thumbs up
and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.759 
and
also<00:02:53.209> demonstrating<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.989> perfect<00:02:54.560> pushup

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
also demonstrating the perfect pushup

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.140 
also demonstrating the perfect pushup
handles<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:57.310> I'm<00:02:58.310> not<00:02:58.519> sure<00:02:58.670> how<00:02:58.819> much<00:02:58.969> these

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
handles and I'm not sure how much these

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.270 
handles and I'm not sure how much these
good<00:02:59.359> or<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.599> think<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:00.890> they<00:03:00.980> got<00:03:01.129> these

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
good or I think I think they got these

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.580 
good or I think I think they got these
for<00:03:01.549> about<00:03:01.609> twenty<00:03:02.000> dollars<00:03:02.329> but<00:03:02.989> they<00:03:03.260> go<00:03:03.409> all

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
for about twenty dollars but they go all

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.509 
for about twenty dollars but they go all
the<00:03:03.680> way<00:03:03.709> up<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:05.290> 24<00:03:06.290> pounds<00:03:06.469> which<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
the way up to 24 pounds which is

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.259 
the way up to 24 pounds which is
actually<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.030> good<00:03:08.209> deal<00:03:08.359> because<00:03:08.540> most

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
actually a good deal because most

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.699 
actually a good deal because most
dumbbells<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.659> get<00:03:11.900> they<00:03:12.170> usually<00:03:12.560> go

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
dumbbells that you get they usually go

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.220 
dumbbells that you get they usually go
for<00:03:12.739> around<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.790> dollar<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.269> pound<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.079> you're

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
for around a dollar a pound so you're

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.250 
for around a dollar a pound so you're
getting<00:03:15.349> two<00:03:15.739> dumbbells<00:03:16.359> that<00:03:17.359> are<00:03:17.510> 24<00:03:17.930> pounds

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
getting two dumbbells that are 24 pounds

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.910 
getting two dumbbells that are 24 pounds
each<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.879> goes<00:03:20.060> from<00:03:20.299> six<00:03:20.659> pounds<00:03:21.139> all<00:03:21.379> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
each so it goes from six pounds all the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.280 
each so it goes from six pounds all the
way<00:03:21.980> up<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.099> 24<00:03:22.609> pounds<00:03:22.819> so<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.810> increments

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
way up to 24 pounds so the increments

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.289 
way up to 24 pounds so the increments
are<00:03:24.379> 6<00:03:24.709> 9<00:03:24.889> 12<00:03:24.919> 15<00:03:25.519> 18<00:03:25.909> 21<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.780> 24<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.120> is

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
are 6 9 12 15 18 21 and 24 but this is

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.110 
are 6 9 12 15 18 21 and 24 but this is
the<00:03:29.419> kind<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:33.220> you've<00:03:34.220> turned<00:03:34.879> this<00:03:35.000> thing

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the kind that you've turned this thing

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.209 
the kind that you've turned this thing
and<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.930> move<00:03:36.169> it<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:41.329> it<00:03:41.659> adjust<00:03:42.379> to<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:43.219 
and you can move it and it adjust to the

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.179 
and you can move it and it adjust to the
weights<00:03:43.659> so<00:03:44.659> you<00:03:45.290> don't<00:03:45.469> have<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.889> bunch<00:03:46.099> of

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
weights so you don't have a bunch of

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.070 
weights so you don't have a bunch of
dumbbells<00:03:46.579> laying<00:03:47.000> around

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.970 

so<00:03:54.080> it's<00:03:54.260> kind<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.590> kind<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.340> deep<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:56.980> found

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
so it's kind of kind of it deep so found

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.550 
so it's kind of kind of it deep so found
this<00:03:58.160> at<00:03:58.460> goodwill<00:03:59.300> and<00:04:00.730> over<00:04:01.730> here<00:04:02.030> a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.630 

trampoline<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.390> it's<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.510> mini<00:04:08.720> trampoline

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
trampoline and it's a mini trampoline

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.259 
trampoline and it's a mini trampoline
some<00:04:10.640> more<00:04:10.880> steps<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:16.489> Reebok<00:04:16.910> step

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
some more steps and that Reebok step

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.850 
some more steps and that Reebok step
there<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.810> big<00:04:18.110> one<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:20.030> can<00:04:20.209> find<00:04:20.590> jump<00:04:21.590> ropes

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
there a big one you can find jump ropes

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.970 
there a big one you can find jump ropes
and<00:04:22.220> tubes<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:23.810> know<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.110> tubes<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.830> you

something like that and again like they
said<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.850> lot<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.300> times<00:04:47.480> when<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.780> go<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:47.990> get

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.500 
free weight you're going to pay around
the<00:04:51.350> dollar<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.680> pound<00:04:52.000> maybe<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.120> little<00:04:53.330> bit

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
the dollar a pound maybe a little bit

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.640 
the dollar a pound maybe a little bit
less<00:04:53.750> if<00:04:54.260> it's<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:56.260> metal<00:04:57.260> dumbbells

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
less if it's just the metal dumbbells

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.620 
less if it's just the metal dumbbells
the<00:04:57.980> neoprene<00:04:58.400> up<00:04:58.640> felish<00:04:58.910> usually<00:04:59.240> cost<00:04:59.480> a

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
the neoprene up felish usually cost a

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.290 
the neoprene up felish usually cost a
little<00:04:59.750> bit<00:04:59.870> more<00:05:00.200> but<00:05:01.060> sometimes<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.150> can

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
little bit more but sometimes you can

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.650 
little bit more but sometimes you can
find<00:05:03.190> smaller<00:05:04.190> dumbbells<00:05:04.640> I<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:04.970> did<00:05:05.300> find<00:05:05.540> a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
find smaller dumbbells I I did find a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.920 
find smaller dumbbells I I did find a
smaller<00:05:06.140> number<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:09.260> can<00:05:09.290> get<00:05:10.240> dumbbells

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.970 

sometimes<00:05:14.930> you're<00:05:15.080> going<00:05:15.230> to<00:05:15.290> cross<00:05:15.710> stuff

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
sometimes you're going to cross stuff

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.860 
sometimes you're going to cross stuff
like<00:05:16.160> this<00:05:16.750> ab<00:05:17.750> stuff<00:05:18.730> push-ups<00:05:19.730> tough<00:05:20.000> steps
