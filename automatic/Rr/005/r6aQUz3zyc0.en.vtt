00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.930
 good to all and we come to this new 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.370
 you will wonder why there is no 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.960
 remove the value that as you said you see 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.849
 I entered my channel you have already seen these 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.620
 Christmas I will leave the boss's side 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.599
 because first I do not have much time 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.030
 hydration ie the conventional 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.769
 I'm sorry, I already know, I have to 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.449
 do the live making a bar create 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.279
 all that but it's one of after 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.480
 Christmas because if you know I will tell 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.519
 a computer and as soon as they have 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.990
 computer because I have to mount it and everything 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.869
 that and when I have it mounted 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 Well, I'll start working well 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 I have pending and everything 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.500
 and well let's start with a series 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 which is going to be our chapter 3 or 4 and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.310
 Well, I'm going to teach you, because that's going to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.380
 learn the basic tricks equal and more 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.060
 advanced in order to lay first and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.400
 say that I 'm no problem for 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.560
 start what I learned it by watching 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.360
 videos and I'll show it to you 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.040
 in the same way and good the tutorial of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 today we are going to see the easiest tricks 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.330
 that are going to be the ol and the 180 and the 360 ​​and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.220
 good and some derivations so 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.480
 well let's go there but before 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 start let's see more or less with 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 where the fingers are placed on the finger 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.070
 ok to start if we consider 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 that we did not pass in real life, not because 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.830
 using fingers as if they were two 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 legs worth 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.080
 you usually put a finger back here and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 the other or in the middle or forward or a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.380
 little but good here is worth in the middle 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.720
 ahead depends what we are going to do 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 It's worth nothing to have three fingers here that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 there are people who do answered nothing are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.030
 two fingers is as good as a leg 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 and the other one for this you have to have it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 clear that using it worse nobody is going 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.670
 to start with the oli they gave it and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 that magnificent trick that jumping things with 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 this movement 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.830
 let's learn how to make this movement 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.930
 well there are two ways to do it 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.490
 less good to say somehow and the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.260
 good if we consider as said 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.610
 before we do not pass in real life what 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.860
 what we would have to do to make a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 ring would be to go running to go with the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.910
 kit in motion and jump but there 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 people who do not do this that makes a 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.380
 movement backwards and then with the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.910
 own inertia picks it up and jumps and that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.770
 It should not be done because we have 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.690
 with script in real life, you do not do that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 you go back and you pick it up I do not know if I 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.740
 I explain it but I'll teach you to go 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.030
 ahead and jump is good for 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.550
 do the ol and what we have to do 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.970
 is to put our 2-1 top here and another 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.800
 here it is worth and with the back finger we make 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.989
 as a force an impulse to give a blow 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 so that the skate makes this movement 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.910
 It's good for the clip to get up and then 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 with the other finger once you're 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.620
 lifted would be the impetus that comes 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.750
 towards here accommodate it to match the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.239
 script and fall worth I wanted to give a blow 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.239
 here and then with the other finger hold it 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080
 ah 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.930
 is to strike a blow that back with the other 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.950
 must incorporate it and then fall 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.420
 helping us with two fingers 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.190
 good to have them rather 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.260
 perfected and all that is to practice and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.300
 practice and practice, I recommend 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.220
 that once you have the movement of 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.320
 there is this movement you go 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.270
 putting objects that you start with a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.790
 box or with another skate worth or whatever 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.090
 and I tried them and sanín jumping is worth it but 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.489
 well jumping the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.379
 so it's also going to do the most 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.910
 great and highest good I tell you no 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.010
 forget to practice and practice 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.349
 Okay now let's do how to do 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 the holguin and fall into a bar is worth 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.750
 I will use this that you saw in the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.760
 previous bio 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.830
 make one only fall into a bar worth 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 to provide in the most basic is not 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.489
 just practice voucher you have to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.970
 be very clear about the movement of 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.530
 liberals who have it, you can do 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.420
 the oil the bar is worth but we're going to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.580
 try to do it now good we're going to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 try to make an only raise in the bar 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.239
 well and just falling back is worth it already 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.340
 I tell you, you have to practice and practice 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.769
 and practice is worth first with the oli thing 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.720
 easy voucher and then to go to the bar 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.370
 It's super simple, it's the same as doing 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.690
 only but instead of falling on the ground that 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.459
 you are the bar that happens many times 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.160
 we are going to do like this and you are going to fall more what 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.989
 you are going to fall you are not going to place the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.489
 success here is simply a matter of 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.280
 practice is worth and taking you prepare a 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.530
 do you do the icaic 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.180
 then also what you can do is in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.400
 green that was so well fall like that 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.090
 example on the side and fall back like 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.480
 we do this because here we have what 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.220
 have a city or learn to have a 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.410
 lead and turning capital a little 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.840
 and also after doing so in doing the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.840
 600 is rather more difficult not because it is 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.550
 a wind inside but also later 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.410
 then you can practice also you can 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 practice doing it reads and fall into manual and 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.090
 in manuals to fall with only supports 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.160
 everything of wheels or so or so it's worth it depends 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.500
 because one reads fall in ways and 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.150
 make us light and it's worth this let's 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.400
 apply now in the bar voucher we are going to 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.080
 try to do the oli and that were seven 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.450
 folded we go there we have to do 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.880
 simply to do it is to do the uni 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.260
 normal and putting us to fall like that 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.870
 would be to make more strength in the part 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.550
 front of skate is worth to say jump 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.320
 and with your finger from doing strength to 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.040
 to get you have to fall if yes 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.040
 let's try 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.450
 and then so it 's fast down 36 and 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.160
 to fall 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.850
 so it would be just the opposite to do 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.080
 strength in the back is worth it and she 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.770
 I tell you this is a matter of practice and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.940
 practice and practice good vale 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.460
 next you can do that is a 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
 little too pretty simple is the 180 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.360
 is 180 this movement that you can 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.100
 do yes from the ground but do it in the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.330
 air is worth 180 in the air so we 're going 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.400
 to have to do good to do the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.080
 180 The first thing we're going to do is 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.760
 first thing we should do is have this 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.380
 position but with fingers a little more 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.000
 upwards it looked like 180 are not 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.680
 down is a little bit like that towards 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.370
 above how you see or if you are not like this is 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.290
 more like that and it's about hitting here 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.820
 in the back is in the blow and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.590
 with the drag finger now they give them the 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.390
 hit drag and with the other finger what 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.250
 What we do is that when we hit the 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.250
 skate do not lose and fall worth is like 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.980
 give the blow and with this finger hold it 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.889
 hit and hold is a 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.020
 show would be like this 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.270
 close to the blow and with the other fingers 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.800
 endure is worth the truth is pretty 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.930
 simple this trick and a way that 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.729
 I recommend to see if you know well if not 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.860
 you go and that is that you take another skate 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.249
 you put it in the middle more or less and that 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.710
 try to do the 180 and jump what 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.330
 it's perfect right now let's try 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.680
 do the 360 ​​is worth it is rather more 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.259
 difficult because what to give much more 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.789
 force and at has a greater turn worth 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.319
 either double the turn clearly 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.969
 but what happens is that the script is 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.629
 uncontrolled a little bit is a 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.610
 trick 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.680
 you have to give it enough strength there what 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.050
 you have and well the same as before 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.210
 practice a lot is very much 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.520
 practice is much better practice 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.800
 the movement to do 107 60 already what 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.189
 explained a finger back and you give him a 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.409
 impulse and with the other you keep it and 130 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:42.840
 which is the case if it is 360 because it does more 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.250
 long and it falls worth the same as before for 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.580
 see if you come to 360 I recommend that 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.409
 you put a writing whatever 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.490
 there you have it good let's try 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.500
 do the same thing before it's going to be 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.389
 apply now in this case 180 the 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.770
 bar to the bar of also the truth is 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.319
 rather more difficult to me it costs me 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.000
 much more to do is make a touch 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.590
 fall into the bar voucher it reads is very very 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.449
 easy but it makes a trick to fall is more 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.159
 complicated is worth 180 plus or minus 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.569
 I master well but 360 costs me a 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.660
 little bit better let's see but it's worth 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:11.410
 183 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.480
 to this 360 the truth is a lot more 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.310
 complicated to me I get a decade a 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.600
 a million times and good I need 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.220
 practice also a lot 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.260
 I will try to see if it comes out and if not 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.490
 if it comes out, I'll have done a thousand shots 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:29.170
 and Le Havre since yes we will 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:30.520
 try it let's go with the 360 good 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.710
 guys the truth is that the 360 does not 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.540
 come out the bar I'm sorry I'm going to say 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.580
 I am not pro, I know how to do more or less 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.040
 things which do not but good I'm missing 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.900
 a lot of practice and good I hope that it 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.790
 like your real one that has already served you 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.740
 I say it's a lot of practice, it's worth reading 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.090
 When you are afraid, read it and we can 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.550
 start with the following ballet tricks 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.200
 it reads good 360 is also another 4 180 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.020
 that was pretty good and that was 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.370
 combines with many flick 180 effects 60 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.290
 It's worth it if you have to learn these 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.670
 two tricks that are more or less easy and 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.170
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.670

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.790
