00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
these so I was excited and I wanted it

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.330 
these so I was excited and I wanted it
to<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.100> good<00:02:00.280> but<00:02:00.340> if<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.850> can<00:02:01.030> see<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.799> so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
to be good but if you can see it it's so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.710 
to be good but if you can see it it's so
flimsy<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> point<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.909> fan<00:02:07.210> brush<00:02:07.420> is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
flimsy like the point of a fan brush is

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.630 
flimsy like the point of a fan brush is
so<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:08.049> you<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.440> know<00:02:08.560> apply<00:02:09.340> like

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
so that you can you know apply like

so that you can you know apply like
light<00:02:09.970> highlight<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.019> things<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.440> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
light highlight and things like that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.880 
light highlight and things like that
because<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.000> flimsy<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.930> makes<00:02:14.769> it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
because this is so flimsy it makes it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.729 
because this is so flimsy it makes it
really<00:02:14.980> hard<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.910> any<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.540> know<00:02:16.739> control

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
really hard to have any you know control

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.920 
really hard to have any you know control
or<00:02:18.100> precision<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.450> placing<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.049> color<00:02:20.860> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
or precision in placing the color so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.360 
or precision in placing the color so
you'd<00:02:22.930> be<00:02:23.079> much<00:02:23.260> better<00:02:23.320> off<00:02:23.590> getting<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.250> at

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370

pointless<00:04:10.070> brushes<00:04:10.549> because<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.420> angled

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
pointless brushes because this angled

pointless brushes because this angled
foundation<00:04:12.350> brush<00:04:12.680> although<00:04:13.160> i<00:04:13.190> don't<00:04:13.370> use

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
foundation brush although i don't use

you<00:04:14.720> know<00:04:14.750> liquid<00:04:15.200> foundation<00:04:15.680> i<00:04:15.860> still<00:04:16.190> would

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
you know liquid foundation i still would

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.539

never<00:04:16.669> use<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.209> brush<00:04:17.479> because<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.890> is<00:04:19.100> again

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
never use this brush because it is again

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
concealer underneath and it's not bad

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.540 
concealer underneath and it's not bad
for<00:04:33.229> putting<00:04:33.470> like<00:04:33.590> powder<00:04:33.890> underneath<00:04:34.310> your

for putting like powder underneath your

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
eyes because it's flimsy but I just

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.080 
eyes because it's flimsy but I just

wouldn't use it for something that you

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.360 
wouldn't use it for something that you
know<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.600> probably<00:04:39.320> want<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.770> harder<00:04:40.130> brush

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
