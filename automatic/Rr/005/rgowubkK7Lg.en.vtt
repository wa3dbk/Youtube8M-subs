 who commented the barÃ§a of 28 and today 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.380
 We are in a new edition of 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.599
 enchÃ­lame the server we are already in the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.180
 section p and as you may have read in 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.640
 the title I bring you join globovisiÃ³n 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.290
 let it be this you will ask yourselves are 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.079
 the commands and the basic things that 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.939
 they need on their server for the time of 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.440
 that the users enter already I have 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.360
 asked many times so I've decided 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.219
 do it pretty good that this is what 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.930
 vice that puch and how it goes 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.160
 transforming he remembers the first time 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.469
 that we started in the nowhere good and 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.999
 we have all this is what they want 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.399
 consult see the sections 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.289
 above and you can see the whole process 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.909
 everything we have built and created 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.219
 here we have taught it and we have 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.629
 learned step by step and in idols like 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.699
 I always leave the description 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.260
 attached to a link what would be the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.569
 section in its simple version and in its 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.679
 full version and I'll also leave you 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.120
 as always our dearest 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.139
 marchetti touch we are going to open it to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.610
 continuation 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.010
 let's click here as you will see 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.240
 we are in the section pe and here where 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.460
 says line 367 and 371 of licenses that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.620
 more says as we can see says config and 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 ml you are going to direct 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.420
 that route that is inside the folder 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 plugins inside the essence folder by 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.400
 course you will find the file with fix 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.310
 they will go to line 367 and 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.470
 also to line 371 and there in those two 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.300
 lines are going to copy all this like this 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 start to finish control ce a 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.320
 then let's copy the second 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.570
 line this or direct once more to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.440
 our confi and we will position ourselves 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 on the 371 line or give you control go and 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 we will have replaced all these 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590
 values that are within the line to 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 from the two points and the two 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.550
 quotes that's the only thing that has to 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.620
 remain fixed they will always be able to edit 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.510
 the color and what they want to appear 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.970
 in this case it tells us that the user 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.070
 has disconnected and here where the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.620
 server name you can delete it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.510
 and put the name they want for 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.570
 example 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.060
 craft 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.800
 and once saved all the changes if 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 you have edited everything as you want 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.970
 that appears to our case we are going to 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.250
 leave as is and we will give to save 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.560
 in idols now yes finally we're going to 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 copy where it says fail permission that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.209
 means firework join these allow 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.550
 that any player who enters the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.140
 server throwing a firework 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.760
 random random with any mixture of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.140
 colors and sound that is pretty 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.090
 cookie and they're going to see now 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.830
 below what you are going to have to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.990
 to do is to go to the machete milestone of course 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.760
 copy the permission this now go to 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.920
 your former permission folder within your 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.050
 folder plugin edit with note blog 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 of the file in my case I use note 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 path plus plus once inside the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.550
 file allow point and ml you are going 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.739
 to add to each group for example to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 the default the following command help 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.910
 I have added it, what it will do is 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.350
 activate the fireworks to 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.900
 Any player who enters the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.239
 server and it will be repeated every time the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.530
 player enter well texas against him if 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.480
 does not have the permission will not happen 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.130
 absolutely nothing are we going to save the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.360
 then let's go in and out of the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.280
 server to see that everything is 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 working correctly we are going to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.710
 squeeze the coffee 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.200
 to disconnect 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.680
 let's enter one more time will get us 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.680
 the server 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.159
 out of this as you can see is 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.890
 our message that we have set to 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.470
 principle and also obviously has no 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.500
 what would be the firework 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.840
 when leaving the server of course here 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.700
 we can corroborate it in the console that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.500
 when we leave the server has sent 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.840
 the maximum message arg agliotti is 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.610
 disconnected from and the name here from his 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.890
 server that if you configure it 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.319
 good idols and a little arrow will appear on 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.700
