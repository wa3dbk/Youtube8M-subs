trailer we went up to 16.8 which was
good<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.170> did<00:00:31.470> some<00:00:31.769> empty<00:00:32.250> mileage<00:00:33.180> numbers

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
good so I did some empty mileage numbers

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.950 
good so I did some empty mileage numbers
went<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> Malibu<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:35.730> lost<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.480> got

stuck<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.790> stop-and-go<00:00:38.790> traffic

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
stuck in a lot of stop-and-go traffic

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
stuck in a lot of stop-and-go traffic
and<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:41.010> mileage<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:42.210> 145<00:00:43.140> point<00:00:43.590> six<00:00:44.210> eight

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and my mileage was 145 point six eight

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.010 
and my mileage was 145 point six eight
point<00:00:46.020> nine<00:00:46.170> eight<00:00:47.129> gallons<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.879> fuel<00:00:48.059> which

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
was 16.2 miles per gallon so actually

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.799 
was 16.2 miles per gallon so actually
less<00:00:52.230> than<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:52.860> trailer<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:54.149> still<00:00:54.480> more

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
less than with my trailer but still more

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.029 
less than with my trailer but still more
than<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.680> suburban<00:00:56.219> normally<00:00:59.780> hit<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.039> Sunday

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
than the suburban normally hit a Sunday

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.750 
than the suburban normally hit a Sunday
Drive<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.390> waited<00:01:03.629> 95<00:01:03.930> miles<00:01:04.580> then<00:01:05.580> use

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
Drive and we waited 95 miles then use

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.420 
Drive and we waited 95 miles then use
six<00:01:06.090> point<00:01:06.360> oh<00:01:06.420> eight<00:01:06.619> gallons<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.950> fuel<00:01:08.100> which

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
six point oh eight gallons of fuel which

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
six point oh eight gallons of fuel which
is<00:01:08.640> only<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.020> 15.6<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.640> puts<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.350> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is only a 15.6 so that puts it right

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.359 
is only a 15.6 so that puts it right
about<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> absolute<00:01:16.979> best<00:01:17.250> that

test<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.740> trip<00:01:29.040> yielded<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.119> two

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
test well this trip yielded about two

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and I never shut it off so really

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
and I never shut it off so really
disappointing<00:01:37.409> numbers<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> learned<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
disappointing numbers but I learned a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
disappointing numbers but I learned a
lot<00:01:38.640> um<00:01:39.030> watching<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:39.990> egts<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> know

lot um watching my egts and you know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
lot um watching my egts and you know
watch<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.009> o2<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.490> doing<00:01:46.820> basically<00:01:47.820> in

watch what my o2 is doing basically in

remember<00:03:17.989> exactly<00:03:18.350> your<00:03:18.890> cut-offs<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:20.680> i'm

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
remember exactly your cut-offs but i'm

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.390

know<00:03:48.950> what<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.400> expect<00:03:49.850> but<00:03:50.090> i<00:03:50.150> will<00:03:50.359> try<00:03:50.570> it

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
know what to expect but i will try it

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.460 
know what to expect but i will try it
and<00:03:52.190> then<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.359> course<00:03:53.390> i<00:03:53.720> have<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.870> stand<00:03:54.230> alone

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
and then of course i have to stand alone

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.979 
and then of course i have to stand alone
which<00:03:54.709> i<00:03:54.859> will<00:03:54.920> be<00:03:55.220> able<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.670> do<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.810> i'm

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
which i will be able to do but i'm

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.599 
which i will be able to do but i'm
trying<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.380> do<00:03:57.530> as<00:03:57.709> much<00:03:57.920> as<00:03:58.069> I<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.400> with

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
trying to do as much as I can with

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.660 
trying to do as much as I can with
everybody<00:03:59.030> with<00:03:59.209> stock<00:03:59.480> computers<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.670> you

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
everybody with stock computers and you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.670 
everybody with stock computers and you
know<00:04:01.790> more<00:04:02.120> or<00:04:02.239> less<00:04:02.420> stock<00:04:02.720> rigs<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.470> see

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
know more or less stock rigs and see

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.830 
know more or less stock rigs and see
what<00:04:03.859> can<00:04:04.459> be<00:04:04.519> due<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.090> attack<00:04:05.420> all<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.690> these

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
what can be due to attack all of these

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.660 
what can be due to attack all of these
so<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:07.489> conclusion<00:04:07.880> my<00:04:08.480> bad<00:04:09.380> numbers<00:04:09.859> was<00:04:10.130> stop
