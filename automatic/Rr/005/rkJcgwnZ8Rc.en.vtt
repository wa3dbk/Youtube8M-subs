 the future on the channel expect you to have that 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 for tomorrow's friends are Thursday, June 11th, and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 for beloved by you and me 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 game civilization 5 and add 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 is called a new world break or on 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.240
 literally translated brave new world and I 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 friends waited for this passage as manna 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.149
 Heavenly I have been waiting for so long and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 additions and so long want to write it 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 that just no words this friends will 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.180
 direct continuation of the passage and that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 the most important thing 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 the story told by me civilization 5 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 boogie kings 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.770
 so this passage will be interesting 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 what are my old fans who 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 familiar with me since the old old games 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.989
 Well, in particular, by civilization 5 boogie 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.449
 kings and new new people who like 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.659
 since they still wander to the channel but only for the sake of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.799
 this game is unrealistically important to me 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.189
 will be passing 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 it will be on audience retention 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.970
 sent to you will be very interesting 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 watch this and it will be very interesting 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 look new viewer not familiar with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 so that i usually make you expect again 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 incredible adventures in the world 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.740
 civilizations 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.360
 politics culture and art warriors 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 diplomacy and stuff like that and this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.229
 friends will be incredibly cool and I'm right 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 really looking forward to it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.820
 that's why by the way I'm already on 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.369
 for several days letting 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 two episodes at once for the last day 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.310
 do it because i need to finish 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 the game is just such tomorrow because 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 tomorrow I start a new passage and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.939
 keep three games on the channel at once 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 difficult but I have such a suspicion 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.770
 that I do not have time to finish the passage for 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 flippers of up till tomorrow besides today 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.850
 you expect grim fandango who too 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.320
 it is impossible about which in general is also impossible 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.050
 in connection with this it is possible for them to forget 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.210
 the channel will be three games from this i think 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 nothing gets hurt just 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.900
 just do not wait for 2 Syria for the last of 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620
 ace per day as we approach our 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.680
 the end 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.480
 you will be expected maybe one by one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.510
 series per day maybe not even every 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.090
 day but most importantly for the last pass 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.220
 on the channel will soon pass and remain 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.310
 only two games grim fandango and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.110
 civilization 5 brave new world and this 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 there will be two crazy 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.850

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.190
