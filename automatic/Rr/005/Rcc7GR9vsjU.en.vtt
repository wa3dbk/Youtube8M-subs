00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.646
 The salvation of the earth. 

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:32.303
 It's two million light-years away. 

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:44.085
 Welcome to EDN III 

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:48.040
 Hey my beautiful 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.462
 I'd love to say I'm getting used to it. 

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.570
 The cold is almost over with me ... 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:54.407
 More will not. 

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.532
 NEVEC believes that this can solve the energy crisis on Earth. 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:58.961
 I believe that we can. 

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:01.950
 There is something the old men are not telling us. 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:04.057
 James ... 

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:05.562
 This place has secrets ... 

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.653
 But what are you doing? 

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.153
 Chief, we have an attacker at the base. 

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.440
 Far from home. 

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.850
 Away from security. 

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:36.321
 Far from being alone. 

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:39.937
 What the hell is this place? 

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.370
 They told us that we were the only ones on this planet! 

00:01:57.468 --> 00:01:59.620
 Surviving is not enough. 

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.520
 Beginning of 2013.
