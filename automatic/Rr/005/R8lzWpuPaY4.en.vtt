00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:41.980
 oh it would not be a demon hello everyone today is 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:47.050
 the video will be on welding repair 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.019
 welding gloves croc shorter then 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.510
 faced with this problem he knows 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:57.420
 what 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.330
 In general, the gloves are still good normal 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.159
 but already 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 The threads burned out before I tried to sew 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.450
 it all back thread Well, how would it 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:18.750
 now for a little while now I want to show how I am 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.750
 shook gloves with a stapler and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 scope 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.890
 so here we combine we take a stapler 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:01.780
 but soft wood backing so then 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.320
 bend the ends of the bracket 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:24.569
 and here are the way to sew like 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:31.930
 I used to try to sew the whole thing 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:37.030
 wire too wire not long 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.319
 keep so now we turn over in 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.880
 restaurant and wire, too, it is not long 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:50.590
 holding on and a lot of fuss here 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:59.410
 having tried the stapler in such a way pancake 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:10.349
 generally it works great again 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:10.349
 we bend the edges in this way again 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.160
 sew a cop 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:30.980
 and so here it turns out ok decided 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:34.790
 quite a while still in general gloves still 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:42.049
 it is a pity to throw out normal 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:46.489
 here I have the same way well 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.579
 and if the thread to sew it like gloves 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.040
 leather 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.099
 the needle is hard to stitch and again 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.790
 chooses the thread for a while 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:05.799
 in a way 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:11.620
 it turns out fine and they still serve 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:18.699
 now I am going to continue further and continue working 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.699
 Here is a video video advice
