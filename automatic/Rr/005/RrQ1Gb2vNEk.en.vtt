using a four bar kit from environmental

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
using a four bar kit from environmental
lights<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.500> nice<00:00:40.680> setup

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
lights they have a really nice setup

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.090 
lights they have a really nice setup
here<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.820> uses<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.570> strip<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> high<00:00:43.680> brightness

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
here it uses a strip of high brightness

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790 
here it uses a strip of high brightness
LEDs<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.500> they're<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
LEDs and you can see that they're on

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.049 
LEDs and you can see that they're on
right<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
right now which is where you have that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.200 
right now which is where you have that
pink<00:00:48.239> glow<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> 850<00:00:49.410> nanometer

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
pink glow they're the 850 nanometer

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.720 
pink glow they're the 850 nanometer
wavelength<00:00:51.800> they<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> hundred<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
wavelength they have a hundred and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.600 
wavelength they have a hundred and
twenty<00:00:54.149> degree<00:00:54.510> viewing<00:00:54.870> angle<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.980> they

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
twenty degree viewing angle so they

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
twenty degree viewing angle so they
really<00:00:57.090> fill<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.020> box<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.500> light<00:00:58.859> much

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really fill up the box with light much

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.959 
really fill up the box with light much
better<00:00:59.789> than<00:01:00.000> those<00:01:00.710> security<00:01:01.710> CCTV<00:01:02.070> lamps

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
better than those security CCTV lamps

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
better than those security CCTV lamps
that<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.480> lot<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> people<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.229> which<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that a lot of people use which have a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.830 
that a lot of people use which have a
very<00:01:05.010> narrow<00:01:05.489> fifteen<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> thirty<00:01:06.299> degree

beam<00:01:07.710> angle<00:01:07.890> sure<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.180> light

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
beam angle sure they can you know light

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
beam angle sure they can you know light
up<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> subject<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.200> far<00:01:10.409> away<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.650> we're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
up a subject really far away but we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
up a subject really far away but we're
only<00:01:11.640> working<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.090> typically<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> few<00:01:12.720> feet

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
only working with typically a few feet

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
only working with typically a few feet
when<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.290> building<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> rear<00:01:13.799> di<00:01:14.010> box<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
when you're building a rear di box so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
when you're building a rear di box so
you<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.119> something<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you want to have something with a really

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
you want to have something with a really
really<00:01:16.140> wide<00:01:16.320> beam<00:01:16.619> angle<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.970> high

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really wide beam angle and really high

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
really wide beam angle and really high
bright<00:01:18.509> intensity<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.890> light

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bright intensity so that your light

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
bright intensity so that your light
comes<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> pinna<00:01:21.659> fills<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> box

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
comes out of the pinna fills the box

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
comes out of the pinna fills the box
area<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> comes<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:24.060> exactly<00:01:24.509> where

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
area and comes out right exactly where

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.999 
area and comes out right exactly where
your<00:01:24.750> fingers<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.560> reflects<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
your fingers are so it reflects the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
your fingers are so it reflects the
light<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> camera<00:01:27.780> four<00:01:28.710> bar

bar<00:01:30.869> kids<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> four<00:01:31.439> bar<00:01:31.560> typical<00:01:31.979> kit<00:01:32.130> will

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
bar kids but a four bar typical kit will

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
bar kids but a four bar typical kit will
consist<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.820> bars<00:01:33.180> connector<00:01:34.170> wires<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
consist of bars connector wires going in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
consist of bars connector wires going in
between<00:01:35.340> they've<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.390> added<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.960> new

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
between they've also added this new

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.580 
between they've also added this new
thing<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> dimmer<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.509> touch<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
thing which is a dimmer it's touch so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.490 
thing which is a dimmer it's touch so
you<00:01:40.650> turn<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:42.090> off<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you turn on turn off and then you can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.480 
you turn on turn off and then you can
also<00:01:43.680> dim<00:01:45.860> or<00:01:47.299> not<00:01:48.299> dim

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.039 

and<00:01:53.970> brighter<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:56.010> make<00:01:56.790> them<00:01:57.049> less

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and brighter so you can make them less

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
and brighter so you can make them less
bright<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.369> bright<00:01:59.700> just

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
bright if you need to more bright just

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
bright if you need to more bright just

here we can get pretty good results
without<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.720> Box<00:04:10.019> closed<00:04:10.320> you'll<00:04:10.500> get<00:04:10.620> even

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
without the Box closed you'll get even

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.009 
without the Box closed you'll get even
more<00:04:11.070> brighter<00:04:11.459> blobs<00:04:11.760> with<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.630> Box<00:04:12.780> close

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
more brighter blobs with the Box close

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.930 
more brighter blobs with the Box close
to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> light<00:04:13.500> will<00:04:13.680> bounce<00:04:14.130> around<00:04:14.370> inside

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
to the light will bounce around inside

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.640 
to the light will bounce around inside
and<00:04:15.209> only<00:04:15.630> come<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> top<00:04:16.229> instead<00:04:16.560> of

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
and only come out the top instead of

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.099 
and only come out the top instead of
coming<00:04:16.919> out<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.160> large<00:04:17.970> side<00:04:18.269> over<00:04:18.510> here<00:04:18.540> but

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
coming out the large side over here but

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.840 
coming out the large side over here but
as<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.530> can<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.769> pretty<00:04:20.130> similar<00:04:20.519> results<00:04:20.820> to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
as you can see pretty similar results to

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.260 
as you can see pretty similar results to
the<00:04:21.000> rear<00:04:21.269> di<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.690> we<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.930> saw<00:04:23.120> using<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
the rear di that we just saw using the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.450 
the rear di that we just saw using the
LED<00:04:24.540> bars<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.229> this<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.560> great<00:04:25.800> way<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:25.979> make

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
LED bars but this is a great way to make

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.600 
LED bars but this is a great way to make
sure<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.729> don't<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.000> any<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:28.380> know<00:04:28.500> loss<00:04:29.370> of

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
sure you don't get any you know loss of

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.650 
sure you don't get any you know loss of
infrared<00:04:29.880> light<00:04:29.970> at<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.240> corners<00:04:30.540> because

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
infrared light at the corners because

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.600 
infrared light at the corners because
you<00:04:30.840> can<00:04:30.960> screw<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.770> anywhere<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.220> want<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
you can screw it anywhere you want you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.460 
you can screw it anywhere you want you
can<00:04:32.729> even<00:04:32.850> double<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.300> back<00:04:33.479> or<00:04:33.840> do<00:04:34.290> whatever

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
can even double it back or do whatever

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:44.570 
can even double it back or do whatever
configuration<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.280> want
