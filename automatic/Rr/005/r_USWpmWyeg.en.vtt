00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 Well, in this tutorial we are going to see how 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 a case is made for the phone in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.939
 book form let's do it in a way 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.930
 it looks like old skin or 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.930
 a little worn 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.730
 well these are the materials that we're going 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.690
 to need is going to be glue 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.250
 instant scissors pencil rule rubber eva 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.890
 of the three colors that you see without 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.180
 transparent and a cardboard box that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.390
 I have used as you see are one of a 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.390
 Pizza 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 The first thing we are going to do is draw 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.040
 the outline of the mobile let's do it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 twice and we're also going to draw what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.320
 that would be the width of the mobile on the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.320
 paperboard 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 The next thing we will do as you are 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.560
 watching is to cut it 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.770
 once we have the three pieces 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.840
 cut out we're going to draw the ones on the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.579
 rubber if you notice I have left between 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 piece and piece a distance of half 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.970
 centimeter 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.619
 the next thing we're going to do is paste 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.619
 each piece in its place 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.999
 once the three pieces are pasted if you 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.920
 you fix I have left a margin of half 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.130
 centimeter in the contour of the three 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 pieces 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 Well, precisely because of that monk in whom 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.270
 we have left let's cut out 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.140
 now with this piece that we have left 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.120
 after trimming we are going to paste it 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.569
 on another piece of rubber eva a little 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.569
 bigger 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.129
 once it is well stuck we cut the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.129
 eva rubber band 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.540
 Now let's measure the width of the mobile 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.670
 to create a strip that will serve us 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.980
 as a fastening of the cover 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.720
 if you look at the strip that I created, it's 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.520
 Like the wide we have measured but 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.710
 a little bit shorter than the outline of the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.510
 mobile 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.170
 Stick the ends of the strip with 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.170
 instant glue 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 to protect the mobile from any friction 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.060
 with the glue or with any other 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.720
 material we are going to wrap it in order 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.720
 transparent 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.420
 The next thing we will do is place the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.420
 pull around the mobile 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.760
 once placed we are going to throw him 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.319
 glue by the edge of the strip and what 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.639
 we are going to stick on the piece that 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.639
 we had created previously 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.810
 The next thing I have done is put myself 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.700
 to decorate the book if you see I have caught 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.680
 a piece of rubber eva one more color 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 clear to make the spine of the book 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.340
 so that the cover can be closed 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.380
 correctly we have created these two 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.400
 eva rubber strips that we will put as 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.400
 if they were a close 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.599
 Now let's decorate the back part 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.340
 if you notice with bits of how to the 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.230
 small has given a little volume 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.720
 and I have placed a piece of rubber eva 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.310
 black in the center good in the part of 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.590
 up in which I have then put a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.519
 one as simulating that it is number one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.519
 of a collection 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.510
 as you can see with a marker 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.349
 permanent I have drawn a few dots that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.939
 simulate seams 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.339
 optionally you can give it a 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:40.529
 little bit of shade using watercolors 

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.529
 Temperas or a permanent marker 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.000
 I made a little hole in the case 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.650
 where would the camera be 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.540
 optional you can make one 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.160
 also where the charger is connected 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.160
 or where headphones are connected 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.500
 So far this tutorial in which 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.150
 we have made a cover in the form of a book 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.919
 I hope you liked it if it has been 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.990
 well you know leave your like 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.370
 share it with whoever you want and if 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.050
 do you already know that you can send me 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.409
 an image to any of my networks 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.409
 social 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.060
 if you want to see more tutorials of covers 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.890
 of the phone played on the video that 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.750
 you see in the image or on the card that 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.610
 go up to the right do not forget 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.720
 subscribe and see you in the next
