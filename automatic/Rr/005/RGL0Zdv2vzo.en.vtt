00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.960
 should with the magazine SPEEDWEEK SGi space 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.260
 Folio Case is 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.670
 Get percentages with Jews because I'm quite excited 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.589
 the problem is al Qaeda 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.019
 I have nothing to look for 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.119
 for the iPad 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.079
 and therefore 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 I got this x-clear valley 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.899
 it is 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.039
 sometimes we are very rare 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 So if you really do not really care for the two story 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.980
 the 2 4 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.980
 Hamburg dapd 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.030
 but it should still be 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 Well, let's say that I'm complimenting everything really solidly right you can 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.960
 from a very nice and residential objects 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.880
 we are strong 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 First of all Patrick Simoner has to do more 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.380
 That is a disadvantage 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.380
 earlier was one 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 the iPad 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 finally pushing the background 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.840
 he is the insurer 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 7 users have to break out again 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 the age is in my opinion but also optimally protected 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.990
 garbage bags 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990
 Connections are free 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.230
 in the docking station does not fit any more Robinson Crusoe out of or directly 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.990
 collapsed 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 which really well claims percent 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 you could put them in the stars 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 r 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.150
 stormy 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.559
 to establish 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.679
 and then you can too 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.869
 if you and Superstar rolled 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.749
 all the more so 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.429
 Customers are looking for 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 practically infinite goals 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.129
 so be sure 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.129
 then really nice served 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.379
 So it really close 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.179
 Webber worry 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.499
 always the same again 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.389
 in a police station 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.389
 with the iPad 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.289
 So it can be very nice plant 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:02.959
 also 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.999
 in which 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:08.159
 well-tempered state finds it's worth Â«One must ask questions of regional planning No the apron 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.689
 read what a bit bothers you when you get the 4 8 percent 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.689
 that's what he is 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.190
 but some are possible 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.830
 the 12 o'clock can make it somehow different for him of course people 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.849
 course before 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
 that's really a bit 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.009
 we really had to 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 but it is also in the unfolded state 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.509
 Callsen it is spread Bellmann finds live on Picks here 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.899
 Funcom 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.409
 she should be from this provider 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.079
 percent 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.399
 It could be for more 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.739
 such cases it is 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.979
 are really very high but also their price so heavyweight Silvia 67 euros 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.529
 including shipping 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.579
 but possible 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.379
 well done
