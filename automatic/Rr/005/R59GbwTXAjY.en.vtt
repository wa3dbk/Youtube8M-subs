azithromycin and then what will happen
is<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> goes<00:04:23.550> directly<00:04:23.760> from<00:04:24.090> our

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
is that it goes directly from our

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.290 
is that it goes directly from our
computer<00:04:25.430> through<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> wireless<00:04:26.730> network

and<00:04:27.510> into<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> pharmacy<00:04:28.980> computer<00:04:29.790> directly

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
and into the pharmacy computer directly

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.440 
and into the pharmacy computer directly
Wow<00:04:31.280> first<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.490> all<00:04:32.610> they<00:04:32.970> don't<00:04:33.060> have<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.330> keep

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
Wow first of all they don't have to keep

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.030 
Wow first of all they don't have to keep
track<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> paper<00:04:34.110> prescription<00:04:34.710> anymore

track of the paper prescription anymore

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.240 
track of the paper prescription anymore
that<00:04:35.160> doesn't<00:04:35.430> get<00:04:35.550> lost<00:04:36.140> there's<00:04:37.140> also<00:04:37.470> an

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
that doesn't get lost there's also an

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.070 
that doesn't get lost there's also an
increased<00:04:38.640> accuracy<00:04:39.000> if<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.630> prescription

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
increased accuracy if the prescription

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.780 
increased accuracy if the prescription
goes<00:04:40.470> electronically<00:04:41.130> directly<00:04:41.580> into<00:04:41.700> the

goes electronically directly into the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.510 
goes electronically directly into the
pharmacist<00:04:42.300> computer<00:04:42.750> system<00:04:43.430> we<00:04:44.430> don't

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
pharmacist computer system we don't

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.909 
pharmacist computer system we don't
worry<00:04:44.730> about<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.320> inevitable<00:04:46.320> human<00:04:46.680> errors

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
worry about the inevitable human errors

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.409 
worry about the inevitable human errors
of<00:04:47.100> entering<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.610> information<00:04:47.669> two<00:04:48.330> or

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
of entering that information two or

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.570 
of entering that information two or
three<00:04:48.570> times<00:04:48.750> into<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.230> system<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.800> think

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
three times into a system I think

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.610 
three times into a system I think
patients<00:04:50.790> will<00:04:51.120> have<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.330> lot<00:04:51.690> more<00:04:51.930> confidence

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
patients will have a lot more confidence

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.969 
patients will have a lot more confidence
in<00:04:53.610> our<00:04:53.820> prescribing<00:04:54.330> when<00:04:55.260> they<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.620> we're

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
in our prescribing when they know we're

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.219 
in our prescribing when they know we're
electronically<00:04:56.850> connected<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.020> world

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
electronically connected to the world

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.690 
electronically connected to the world
that<00:04:59.160> we<00:04:59.400> can<00:04:59.760> with<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.330> computer<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:02.010> that

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
that we can with that computer know that

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.060 
that we can with that computer know that
a<00:05:02.729> drug<00:05:03.060> doesn't<00:05:03.300> interact<00:05:03.720> or<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.950> they

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
a drug doesn't interact or that they

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.400 
a drug doesn't interact or that they
don't<00:05:05.310> have<00:05:05.550> side<00:05:06.090> effects<00:05:06.419> or<00:05:06.630> what<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.229> side

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
don't have side effects or what the side

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.130 
don't have side effects or what the side
effects<00:05:07.740> are<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.190> think<00:05:08.790> without<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.120> doubt<00:05:09.210> when

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
effects are I think without a doubt when

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.680 
effects are I think without a doubt when
patients<00:05:10.620> here<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:11.010> we've<00:05:11.570> made<00:05:12.570> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
patients here that we've made the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.150 
patients here that we've made the
transition<00:05:13.080> into<00:05:13.320> an<00:05:13.590> electronic<00:05:14.070> record

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
transition into an electronic record

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.790 
transition into an electronic record
patients<00:05:15.150> immediately<00:05:15.450> are<00:05:15.900> happy<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.590> hear

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
patients immediately are happy to hear

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.740 
patients immediately are happy to hear
this<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.210> idea<00:05:18.450> that<00:05:18.510> their

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
this and have the idea that their

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.880 
this and have the idea that their
records<00:05:19.110> are<00:05:19.140> going<00:05:19.290> to<00:05:19.350> be<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.530> carefully

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
records are going to be more carefully

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.170 
records are going to be more carefully
taken<00:05:20.190> care<00:05:20.400> of<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.640> that<00:05:20.760> we're<00:05:20.880> going<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.060> be

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
taken care of and that we're going to be

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.390 
taken care of and that we're going to be
up<00:05:21.419> to<00:05:21.570> date<00:05:21.750> on<00:05:21.930> all<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:22.530> their<00:05:22.830> lab<00:05:23.040> results

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
up to date on all of their lab results

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.090 
up to date on all of their lab results
and<00:05:23.460> things<00:05:23.640> like<00:05:23.760> this<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.060> much<00:05:24.210> more

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
and things like this in a much more

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.770 
and things like this in a much more
speedy<00:05:26.100> fashion<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:27.150> would<00:05:27.270> not<00:05:27.419> go<00:05:27.570> back<00:05:27.750> to

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
speedy fashion we would not go back to

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.930 
speedy fashion we would not go back to
paper<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.280> know<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.580> takes<00:05:29.790> some

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
paper this is you know it takes some

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.020 
paper this is you know it takes some
learning<00:05:30.479> but<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.410> seems<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.919> me<00:05:32.040> like<00:05:32.070> all<00:05:32.460> the

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
learning but it seems to me like all the

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.940 
learning but it seems to me like all the
effort<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:33.540> put<00:05:33.630> in<00:05:33.900> up<00:05:34.020> front<00:05:34.229> is<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.710> well

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
effort that's put in up front is so well

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.620 
effort that's put in up front is so well
worth<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.729> were<00:05:35.850> not<00:05:36.030> never<00:05:36.240> go<00:05:36.450> back

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
worth it and we were not never go back

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.140 
worth it and we were not never go back
