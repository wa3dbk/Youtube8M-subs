00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.219
 so I tied 16 centimeters pattern 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.769
 asterisks now we need to finish 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:20.150
 the hat goes further down 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:23.300
 loops we take and every two loops too 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.300
 knit together 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:41.450
 1 edge 2 rented together 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:44.900
 following 2 together and so knit until the end 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:50.680
 tying every two loops together 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.680
 front together 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.000
 together 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.700
 every 2 loops together so yes my knit 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.640
 until the end of the row here I tied 2 loops 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.409
 together until the end of the series now 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:26.810
 turn over and knit purl further 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.229
 loops first edge I take off and all 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 purl 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:46.369
 so we knit until the end of the row all 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:48.770
 purl loops so I knitted 2 row 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.649
 purl loops now every 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.140
 fourth loop 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:01.479
 not every fifth sixth we knit 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.479
 together 4 1 2 3 4 facial 5 6 together 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:13.900
 take the needle remove the first loop 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.900
 edge 4 facial 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.359
 2 together 4 facial 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.209
 4 facial 2 together so we knit until the end 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.620
 4 facial rows 2 months 4 facial 2 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.140
 together here I knitted 4 facial 2 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.709
 reached the end together now we 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.560
 turn over and knit purl 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.110
 loops and so we knit 7 rows 7 rows 1 row 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.799
 this until the end we knit purl 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:13.209
 Then we knit the front 7 rows. 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.200
 bound after 7 rows 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.930
 we do the facial loops again 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:31.000
 adding every two loops tying 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:31.000
 together I take the first 2 together 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.629
 so knit to the end of row 2 together loop 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.300
 loops together 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:12.770
 2 5 2 loops knitted together further 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.130
 turning and knitting again 2 loops 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.130
 together 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:30.640
 but the night side 2 together on 2 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.640
 together so knit until the end of row 2 together 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:13.289
 then these loops we delay on a thread 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:18.770
 and our cap ready so on we 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.770
 sew tighten and stitching
