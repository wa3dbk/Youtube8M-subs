00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.599
 watsoft monte cristo niort these are the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.969
 breaking news about sony 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.230
 is rather a new invention that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.370
 will be arriving very soon on the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 video game market 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 but the ace red dja ad we'll say 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 advances actually on it on this 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 technology that is to say that it's okay 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 to be in fact finally the helmet to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.960
 virtual reality so what is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 it's just maybe 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 you must have seen we hear about 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.720
 it is a kind of small 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 helmet makes big glasses you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.309
 go m and then you will actually see 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 the game through this case what we 're fat 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.250
 con you're going to turn your head will have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.739
 a 360 view 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.660
 for example you turn your head to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 left and well you see other purposes 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
 with your case you will see in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.610
 left of your screen finally that's it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 special if you want you have a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 sort of panoramic view 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.390
 excuse me on this saix at saint-cast 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.730
 rather interesting and beats for now 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.730
 does not actually have any headsets of this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 like late on the next gen it's up to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.359
 say the playstation 4 and the xbox one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 but are there attention on platforms 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.159
 pc that's more of a kind of alpha finally 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.479
 it's more we'll say some kind of test 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.000
 in fact on it I saw that there is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.770
 a judge believes sarma that involves the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 headphones and virtual reality ie 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 that here you can actually really 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.530
 well played with with this system there it is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.939
 to say see you turn your head and well 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 finally in the game you turn the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.580
 head too 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 and you have some sort of vision 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.939
 you can see a little bit where you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.799
 want with this headset is there and that's 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.570
 true few steps well it can be very 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 interesting so here it's a concept 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.820
 which may appear very 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.290
 Finally soon in any case 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 the announcement since it's called oculus 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.329
 rift that may be announced on the 18th 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.270
 March to the day in fact from San Francisco 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.220
 it's a big event in a grand salon 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 in fact for the game to which 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.119
 will tell sony who are going to talk then 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 why am I talking to you about sony then if 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600
 they say in fact they said like 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.330
 what 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.970
 March 18 in fact they will present a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.790
 future innovation as well as I had some 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.409
 kinds of small little clues 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 suggesting my like what it will 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.549
 a kind of helmet and virtual reality 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.220
 including the oculus rift that may be 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.170
 presented well on March 18 at the gdc's 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.590
 san francisco so to which it 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 could be 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.860
 well I think it can be a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.970
 very good idea after having if that's it 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 but in any case it is true that it is 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.239
 strange enough because there is still 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 two people who will be present kg 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.220
 and who actually represents sony but who 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.080
 are rather important this big 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.209
 company of aia richard marx in college and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 the director of research and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.110
 development as well as y ayuda under the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.810
 measures to yoshida schists that is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.940
 responsible for the software part 2 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.980
 playstation de sony it's still 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.430
 two very important people who are going 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.440
 go there 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.360
 and often when sony they will bring back 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.069
 people as important in fact 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.890
 they represent a little low the company 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.209
 playstation are big risks because 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.360
 whether it's really something 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.209
 very important then in any case of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.910
 sail had of all they think them 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.440
 exquisite finally the future market also de 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.180
 what will happen on the market too 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.320
 9.5 a few not frankly me 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.690
 honestly I think it's a risk 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.489
 to arrive this March 18th in any case it's okay 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.959
 to be something else but I think 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.060
 that this reality finally this helmet the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.650
 virtual reality may appear in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 any case for March 18th 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.540
 of course 2014 so when finally in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.410
 a few weeks of history are in 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.030
 France and care in the pool of 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.730
 comments less clearly I think 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.500
 that basin interest still there on 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.940
 it's a small role of a kind 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.410
 after I have not the price and I have 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.510
 not really had to pray again 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.370
 i know i do not know at all maybe to 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.370
 the several hundred euros has 800 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.280
 rapt and 200 euros the helmet it's not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 given but somewhere in my opinion it's 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.640
 a good goal after which just that case be 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.070
 super heavy or something like that because 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.030
 that otherwise it would be impossible to 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.740
 maneuvering finally would be impossible 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.850
 limit to have on the head all that we go 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.590
 to have a headache after a certain 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.020
 time we take it be a headset 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.860
 light of a very good ergonomics like 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.180
 I tell you every time 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.460
 that must be something 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.720
 also a beautiful design in any case I will 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.490
 show you images to which a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.200
 sony notice could present 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.420
 that is to say the script shot 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.950
 and frankly he rather has a very beautiful 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 design not hoping that's it 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.240
 for the 18th of March anyway plus one 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.440
 nobody are waiting for this event there and 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.000
 then especially more than one person 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.740
 expect it to be this famous 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.450
 headset the virtual reality 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.740
 here is my sister have all the people thanks 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.660

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.920
 great pleasure especially even if it will not be
