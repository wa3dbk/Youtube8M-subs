what's the sweet spot for what you do

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.800 
what's the sweet spot for what you do
usually<00:01:27.010> around<00:01:27.100> 15<00:01:27.670> inches<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.390> pretty<00:01:28.659> good

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
usually around 15 inches is pretty good

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.030 
usually around 15 inches is pretty good
any<00:01:28.990> bigger<00:01:29.229> than<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.680> gets<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.920> little

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
any bigger than that it gets a little

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800 
any bigger than that it gets a little
cumbersome<00:01:30.520> because<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:31.150> can<00:01:31.299> zoom<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.659> on<00:01:31.780> a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
cumbersome because you can zoom in on a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.870 
cumbersome because you can zoom in on a
15<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.500> as<00:01:32.560> long<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.920> screens<00:01:33.250> high

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
15 and as long as the screens high

resolution and has good brightness that
that's<00:01:35.830> just<00:01:36.040> fine<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.659> storage<00:01:37.659> obviously

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
that's just fine and storage obviously

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.660 
that's just fine and storage obviously
