00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.359 

this<00:02:02.819> is<00:02:02.999> me<00:02:03.210> showing<00:02:03.569> you<00:02:03.749> the<00:02:03.810> first<00:02:04.369> part

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this is me showing you the first part

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.559 
this is me showing you the first part
that<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> wax<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.479> I'm

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
that I'm going to wax and I'm

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.919 
that I'm going to wax and I'm
determining<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.500> grows<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> I'm

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
determining that it grows down so I'm

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.890 
determining that it grows down so I'm
going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:10.860> wax<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.940> stick<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> then

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
going to get my wax on a stick and then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.259 
going to get my wax on a stick and then
apply<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.410> wax<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:14.129> down<00:02:14.459> in<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.879> same

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
apply the wax going down in the same

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.000 
apply the wax going down in the same
direction<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.530> hair<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.860> growing<00:02:17.430> in

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
direction that the hair is growing in

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.259 
direction that the hair is growing in
when<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.099> apply<00:02:20.370> your<00:02:20.549> wax<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.150> want

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
when you apply your wax you don't want

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to get too little that it doesn't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.570 
to get too little that it doesn't
completely<00:02:24.769> cover<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.860> hair<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
completely cover the hair but then you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.009

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
through the same direction of hair

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.610 
through the same direction of hair
growth<00:02:43.560> game<00:02:44.069> thing<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.670> bottom<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.620> rip

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
growth game thing at the bottom and rip

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.750 
growth game thing at the bottom and rip
it<00:02:46.769> off<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:48.829> when<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:49.950> pull<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.370> want<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.390 
it off and when you pull it you want to
pull<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.420> opposite<00:02:52.260> direction<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.340> the

pull it in the opposite direction of the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
pull it in the opposite direction of the
hair<00:02:53.519> growth<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.569> as<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.260> saw<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.799> applied<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
hair growth so as you saw I applied it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.759 
hair growth so as you saw I applied it
downward<00:02:56.819> because<00:02:57.030> my<00:02:57.359> hair<00:02:57.690> was<00:02:57.989> going<00:02:58.379> down

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
downward because my hair was going down

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.199 
downward because my hair was going down
and<00:02:59.129> then<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.400> took<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> off<00:03:00.329> upward<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.260> here

and then I took it off upward and here

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.849 
and then I took it off upward and here
I'm<00:03:03.209> applying<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:03.780> upward<00:03:04.170> because<00:03:04.560> that's

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
I'm applying it upward because that's

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.800 
I'm applying it upward because that's
the<00:03:05.160> way<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.549> hair<00:03:05.760> grows<00:03:05.790> right<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:06.540> it
