today you think Craig you know on a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.920 
today you think Craig you know on a
violin<00:02:10.100> it's<00:02:10.310> very<00:02:10.640> natural<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:13.900> right<00:02:14.900> so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
violin it's very natural to do right so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.670 
violin it's very natural to do right so
it's<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.500> again<00:02:17.200> doesn't<00:02:18.200> work<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.620> that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
so it tends to go to the middle of the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.600 
so it tends to go to the middle of the
third<00:02:24.680> beat<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.310> would<00:02:25.580> say<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.270> know<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.860> and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.000

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
no I think you can have a little more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.400 
no I think you can have a little more
poise<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:03.980> your<00:03:04.130> dad<00:03:05.410> already

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
poise like you know your dad already

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.800 
poise like you know your dad already
made<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.670> continue<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.330> know<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.600> that

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
made you continue you know like that

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.040 
made you continue you know like that
moment<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.440> pause<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:11.240> very<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:12.020> know

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
moment of pause be very you know

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:41.440 
moment of pause be very you know
meaningful<00:03:12.770> all<00:03:13.310> right

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.900 

yeah<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.260> think<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.620> trick<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:42.890> don't<00:03:43.730> play

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
yeah I think the trick is don't play

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.180 
yeah I think the trick is don't play
these<00:03:44.060> two<00:03:44.300> notes<00:03:44.330> too<00:03:44.780> long<00:03:45.020> because<00:03:45.950> it

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
these two notes too long because it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.680 
these two notes too long because it
sounds<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:46.580> they're<00:03:46.730> connected<00:03:47.030> that's<00:03:47.450> why

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
sounds like they're connected that's why

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:57.570 
sounds like they're connected that's why
this<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.840> eighth<00:03:53.989> no<00:03:54.230> rest<00:03:54.530> must<00:03:54.739> be<00:03:54.890> absurd

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.599 

yeah<00:03:58.580> that's<00:03:59.090> what<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.569> is
