pretty much sucks

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.189 
pretty much sucks
I<00:00:14.599> was<00:00:15.599> called<00:00:17.660> raven<00:00:18.660> black<00:00:18.869> by<00:00:20.869> enrage<00:00:21.869> color

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
I was called raven black by enrage color
and<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:23.070> never<00:00:23.369> gonna<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> brand<00:00:24.150> again

because<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.670> fades<00:00:26.880> nasty<00:00:27.390> colors<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because it just fades nasty colors and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.900 
because it just fades nasty colors and
also<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.340> hard<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> spread
