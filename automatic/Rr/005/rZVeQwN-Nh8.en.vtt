00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 it's a minervois Languedoc wine and 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 this little nectar has just been classified 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.280
 best wine in the world by a jury 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 American 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 more than a price it's a consecration 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.030
 for the domus maximus as much as the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 region has long been criticized by 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.609
 finest palace helene vergne 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.160
 pascal pons believe the experts 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.199
 international this wine is a jewel on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 world's best straight from the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 languedoc and if he has the surprise comes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 reputations that must be broken down 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.550
 I would say Bordeaux so far 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 take away or veb the burgundy all to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 made to the height 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.590
 a surprise but not a revelation 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 it's been twenty years since the vineyard of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
 languedoc roussillon produces wines from 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.010
 quality at the domain mas sanier the requirement 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.809
 has always applied to this vineyard 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 but the buyer was not at the rendezvous 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 you then this trophy is a plus 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.719
 incontestable 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.550
 it allows all those who come for 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.510
 taste the price of tasting all the wines 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 and finally we see that at 20 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.909
 gives a fame to a caf have done 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 not windy think the prices have made that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 at the awards we made wine in 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.930
 trying to do the best of the best 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.939
 we can and regularly try 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.480
 to innovate or experiment with 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.240
 new 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.180
 way to do yet no recipe 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 miracle not the shadow of a computer a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 craftsmanship today guided 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.620
 by an oenologist the work of equipped 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.620
 in particular during 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.150
 the assembly the vine produces the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.160
 grapes grapes different each 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.760
 year depending on the conditions of the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 vintage 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.570
 we adapt as much as possible during the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.460
 winemaking the balance that will exist 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.150
 between these different chips it's up to us 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.760
 to find it 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.800
 competition the viticultural crisis that 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.600
 continues the mas mas domain is not 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.240
 out of business but today the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.070
 orders follow one another's prestige all 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.070
 new allows him to come out of the shadows
