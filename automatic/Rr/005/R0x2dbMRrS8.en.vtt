 Hi all girls! Today nail art tutorial inspired by snowflakes, a very very beautiful nail art. On a blue base. If you want to see the tutorial keep following the video! 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 First of all, I lay a base with the glaze of China Glaze, Matte Magic. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.300
 Then spread the blue enamel over the entire nail. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.000
 Now with white enamel we begin to outline three lines that start from this side. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 For each line we draw four dashes. 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 So! 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 We apply a small diamond to the side of the nail in this way. 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.000
 Now we pass a shiny nail polish. 0: 02: 23.200,0: 01: 24.800 And the nail is complete! 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 This will be the end result. At the end of the video I leave you the demonstrative photos. Including those they sent me: Anna, Antonietta, Damiana and Larisa. 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.700
 If you also want to appear in one of my videos, send me the photos of your nail art on my Facebook page. Merry Christmas! HELLO!
