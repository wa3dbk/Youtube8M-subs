00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.010
 Let's now know what to watch in the sky. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 this week with the naked eye 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.990
 early in the night the Venus planets and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 Jupiter lie side by side in the sky at 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 constellation of lion they are visible 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 until half past eight 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.009
 Saturn begins at night to the east on 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
 constellation of pound and can be 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.590
 observed until four in the morning 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.610
 the night of June 28 passes near the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 planet of the rings mercury arises to the east 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.710
 at the end of the night in the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.710
 constellation of bull from 5 and 6 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.030
 Rambo was one of the most 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.640
 of the 20th century 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.100
 observed variable stars in the nebula 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.649
 of andromeda and showed that she was in the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.269
 another galaxy and that the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.199
 universe was much larger than if 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.379
 imagined 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.659
 with this discovery was born astronomy 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.580
 extragalactic and hubble 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.100
 interested in studying the properties 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.030
 general systems are immense 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 stellar 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.979
 At that time it was already known that many of the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 galaxies had velocities of 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.780
 rather high spacing 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.660
 these speeds were inserted at the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.090
 from the observation of the displacement of 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.000
 spectral lines of chemical elements 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.080
 gases in the stars of the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270
 galaxies 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 the wavelengths of the lines 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.259
 spectral characteristics of galaxies were 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.080
 slightly higher than those observed 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.420
 in a land laboratory in jargon 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.630
 astronomical we say that these lines 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.090
 They experienced a redshift ie were 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.069
 moved to the red side of the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.259
 electromagnetic spectrum 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.369
 the greater the speed of remoteness 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:00.280
 greater is the haiti shift in collaboration the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.950
 astronomers robes free and milton river 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 monson hubble began a study that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.300
 related the velocities of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.800
 distance with the distance to the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.810
 galaxies 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.750
 they realized that the more distant 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.520
 the larger galaxy was its velocity of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.190
 and that there was a 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.220
 proportionality between distance and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.010
 this correlation received the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
 hubble law name and the constant of 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.660
 proportionality is known as 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.110
 constant of hubble one of the parameters 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.450
 key modern cosmology the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.599
 results show that 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.030
 hypothesis published years earlier by 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.459
 one hitherto unknown to the Belgian priest 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 a hypothesis that changed the way 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.709
 we understand the history of our own 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.280
 universe until the next program that your
