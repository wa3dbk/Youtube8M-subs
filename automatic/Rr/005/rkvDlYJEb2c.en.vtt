interesting<00:01:21.439> EMP<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.470> nine<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
interesting EMP is nine now really I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
interesting EMP is nine now really I
think<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.659> realize<00:01:25.140> no<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.470> used<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
think they realize no one used it and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
think they realize no one used it and
now<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.580> last<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> 60<00:01:27.570> seconds<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.990> believe

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
now at last for the 60 seconds I believe

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890 
now at last for the 60 seconds I believe
that<00:01:28.229> same<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.009> i'm<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.220> sure<00:01:29.900> ac-130

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that same thing but i'm not sure ac-130

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580 
that same thing but i'm not sure ac-130
is<00:01:31.049> 13<00:01:31.530> uh<00:01:32.540> it's<00:01:33.540> nice<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.229> pushing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is 13 uh it's nice to see them pushing

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550 
is 13 uh it's nice to see them pushing
it<00:01:34.799> back<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:36.150> show<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.810> harder<00:01:37.079> maybe

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it back to show that it's harder maybe

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
it back to show that it's harder maybe
we'll<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.220> stackable<00:01:38.670> killstreaks<00:01:39.060> because

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we'll have stackable killstreaks because

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
we'll have stackable killstreaks because
of<00:01:39.420> 13<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.780> 15<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.350> still<00:01:40.680> more<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.820> if

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of 13 and 15 that's still more like if

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
of 13 and 15 that's still more like if
you<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.329> chopper<00:01:42.630> gunner<00:01:42.869> that's<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.259> more

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you want chopper gunner that's for more

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.370 
you want chopper gunner that's for more
kills<00:01:43.710> i<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.720> nuclear<00:01:45.720> EMP<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
kills i mean that's a lot nuclear EMP it
