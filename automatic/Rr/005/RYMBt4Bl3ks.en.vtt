00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello on this occasion we are going to make some 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.649
 very cheap table centers with these 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 things so simple that we can 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.310
 find on any based on 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.790
 any place will come out very 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.359
 economic let's start with about 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.249
 cups , ideally, you have it 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 different sizes but if we do not put 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.170
 our ration power with this well what 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.700
 we knew 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.600
 we go to color quotes in using what 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.419
 you want 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.330
 here we have also if you can not use 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.330
 the infinity of things that you can look for 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.210
 a mosquito 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.300
 As a video, you can find it on 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.360
 principle will go very wrong 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 [Music] 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.449
 now we take three flowers in this case 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.770
 we have taken these three roses 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 we introduce it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.540
 with water 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.320
 We fill the cup at different heights 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 we are going to do them 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 m 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.530
 more or less 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.540
 We can use this for any 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 occasion to decorate the table or if 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.720
 we want to put a piece of furniture a dresser that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.980
 let's have what we want 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.980
 the view 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.330
 so finished 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.049
 this would be a 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.750
 option that the rapids that we have 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.880
 accomplished 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.610
 others we are going to prepare a little bit like that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.550
 more styles in we'll need the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.080
 The same tray you can find the one that 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 you find at home or the purchase is that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.879
 that too many models 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.300
 and this time we have eaten these two 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.300
 sticks 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.129
 yes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.129
 all right 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.379
 finish 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.550
 A) Yes 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.920
 we do exactly the same 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.920
 we throw water 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.530
 a little water 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 we also put a candle 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.210
 and already to finish a little acidity of 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.210
 give it another fried touch 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.210
 A) Yes 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.260
 has a roll 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.260
 a little hairy yes 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.069
 and good as you can see we have done two 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.330
 types 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.080
 from young 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.500
 more quickly and they told us that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.500
 the pimps 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.700
 Well nothing with this then 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.700
 until next time
