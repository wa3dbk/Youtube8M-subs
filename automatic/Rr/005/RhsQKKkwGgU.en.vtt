00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.640 
let's get started so we take
approximately<00:01:58.540> about<00:01:58.690> 6<00:01:58.960> ounces<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.470> pasta

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
approximately about 6 ounces of pasta

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.900 
approximately about 6 ounces of pasta
for<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.160> dish<00:02:00.370> these<00:02:01.300> are<00:02:01.450> 1<00:02:01.600> ounce<00:02:01.750> strips

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
for this dish these are 1 ounce strips

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.180 
for this dish these are 1 ounce strips
we<00:02:03.910> drop<00:02:04.120> them<00:02:04.240> into<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.540> heavily<00:02:04.870> salted

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
we drop them into a heavily salted

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.880 
we drop them into a heavily salted
boiling<00:02:06.190> water<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.440> water<00:02:08.560> needs<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
boiling water but the water needs to

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.490 
boiling water but the water needs to
taste<00:02:09.070> like<00:02:09.190> seawater<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> best<00:02:11.350> way

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
taste like seawater that's the best way

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.560 
taste like seawater that's the best way
to<00:02:11.530> cook<00:02:11.860> any<00:02:12.130> type<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.490> pasta<00:02:12.880> or<00:02:12.910> proteins<00:02:13.420> at

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
to cook any type of pasta or proteins at

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.630 
to cook any type of pasta or proteins at
the<00:02:13.660> vegetables<00:02:14.170> we're<00:02:14.440> waiting<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.220> cooking

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the vegetables we're waiting for cooking

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.330 
the vegetables we're waiting for cooking
is<00:02:16.150> heavily<00:02:16.510> salted<00:02:16.750> water<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.040> brings

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
is heavily salted water that just brings

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.980 
is heavily salted water that just brings
out<00:02:18.490> more<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> flavor<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.750> also

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
out more of the flavor and it also

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.780 
out more of the flavor and it also
abuses<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> salts<00:02:20.920> for<00:02:21.100> pasta<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.640> don't

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
abuses the salts for pasta so we don't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.730 
abuses the salts for pasta so we don't
add<00:02:22.030> any<00:02:22.300> more<00:02:22.540> into<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.110> dishes<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.590> no

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
add any more into the dishes so no

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.130 
add any more into the dishes so no
