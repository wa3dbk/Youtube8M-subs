00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello everyone here northwest doctor 60 and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 today we are going to learn how to update 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.369
 our portland console this is a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 new method bank and dry sack a black 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.260
 cat in this method what we do is 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 update the console through the fs of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.170
 3 and the auto g program of 3 as you are 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 watching here I've seen the old version 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.420
 which is an anterior to the new 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.060
 and what right now is to access 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.730
 get away from 3 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.190
 here is loading the fs of 3 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.590
 and then what we will do 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.700
 go to the winner to start another hehe 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.290
 and follow the steps to God 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.300
 good left the left of the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.360
 console the live connection image 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.450
 and down the right the computer 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.880
 What we have to do is give 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.970
 select the last day for example 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:05.110
 and hit the das button and that is also 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.090
 the option of the good one that says that those 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 requirements to have the local freestyle 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:15.070
 the 3 necessarily have the 3 voucher fs 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 of 3 good as you are seeing just 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.810
 launch an application in the console 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.070
 the car what it does is connect to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.590
 the console 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.710
 by the local connects the fs of day and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.930
 again from ftp so I'll nanny her 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.030
 run applications for example this 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 application 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490
 of swift and I think and if I'm not wrong 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.290
 close flash 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.130
 and what it is doing is from 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 right now the great 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 is downloading it as you are watching 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.710
 to the computer 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 and in the same chain the CPU that is 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.250
 loading wool 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 right now it is decrypted lannan 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.240
 with our cpu key 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.510
 and what he is doing right now is 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 create a seuil last day you 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 would be 16 20 21 just finished of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.799
 create the anam 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.090
 they are becoming connected the fs of 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.200
 every send the plan sigÃ¼il to the console 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.299
 right now he has reconnected to the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.100
 fsd and they are launching an application that 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.350
 he described it 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.450
 you see here up on the left you see in 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.810
 the console as you run the application to 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.260
 flash and this phrase 'not the link in the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.260
 console 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.910
 as I am living is a very very method 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 easy too fast enough 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.960
 I personally liked it a lot 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.040
 since I do not have to be spending like 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.439
 pendrive and so on 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.439
 good is about to end 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.439
 reflect 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.420
 how to drink just finished and flash 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.280
 the anam 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.670
 and now he's ready to restart the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.670
 console 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.070
 good that goes a long time in black my 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.550
 screen because he knew it cost 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.500
 much tear the poor 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.740
 and apart that the capture during the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.090
 capture console detect the console left 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.180
 to capture then there is an interval of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.670
 almost 12 minutes or three that you create with 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 black and after you know her the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.500
 connection did not finish booting as 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.060
 this old man watching down to the right 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.590
 self that is still looking for the fs of 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.400
 witching fsd 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.530
 at the moment the console is connected and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.489
 execute the fs after the other boss is 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.489
 will connect to the console 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.480
 well if it is not here that the process of 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.290
 move to the console by william and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.280
 poor ip is finished 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.440
 ok and here I became an avatar 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.709
 and here at the moment at this moment I 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.000
 says that the top nothing will be updated 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.970
 because it is advisable to update the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.280
 avatars 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.960
 well here is where to connect the fsb and 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.390
 How to keep watching as it is going up 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.390
 the avatars to the internal hard disk 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.730
 well here it gets away from being ripped off and 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.030
 to dot of ends list of the 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.030
 avatars 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.470
 when I finish installing the avatars 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:42.680
 auto kgs reconnect the console 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.980
 and will run the executable of the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.980
 upgrade 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.130
 look here that moment connect since not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.130
 it says that the console borer bounced 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.729
 and as I'm watching, go back to find the 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.729
 fsb 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.990
 good if looking for the ps and the psd caught 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.990
 so calm that is 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.090
 the image of the considerable arm with 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.009
 car boss and here I would still be 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.169
 upload the files right now if 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.790
 just finished the initial as 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.310
 I was winning the fs d 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.180
 and he has it here right now because he has 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.190
 connect the other axis and the other three 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.139
 As you can see, the light of 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.379
 oil transactions the console 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.889
 for a stranger to the eastern slope 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.889
 we give like this 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.920
 a state so it will start to come out the 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.010
 update to install ma 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.540
 and here in the tower they asked 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.830
 why would I expect everything to end 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.480
 the process of updating the 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.900
 avatars and then already if you click on the 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.900
 ok button 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.870
 As you can see out of the thing to the list 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.930
 another one again 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.550
 and here in auto jeje dit tells me already don 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.550
 that everything is installed correctly 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.039
 so guys the tutorial today
