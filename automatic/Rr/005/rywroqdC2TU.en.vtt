00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.800
 the outlander of mitsubishi is a robust 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.689
 suv type SUV that offers a 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.490
 spacious cabin with capacity for 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.380
 seven seats and in its entry version 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.289
 for price has front wheel drive 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.700
 or four times two before the arrival of a 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.619
 new generation that will begin to 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.599
 sold in October and has the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.489
 same size as the current brand 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.500
 Japanese has made an interesting 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.460
 offer and we have tried the most 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 affordable 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 the outlander 220 of 4 x 2 motion 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.239
 It has a price of 32 thousand 560 euros and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.269
 enjoy a discount of 6 thousand 670 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.650
 euros so that stays at 26 thousand 400 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.630
 euros 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.540
 It is not too big because it has a 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.690
 length of 467 meters with a width 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.790
 of 1.80 meters and a height of 172 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.820
 meters but the space is fine 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.899
 tapped 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 logically when it takes seven 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.310
 occupied squares a capacity of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 220-liter trunk is enough 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.539
 scarce so that you can not raise 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 a long trip with seven passengers and 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.439
 luggage for all unless it is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 have an accessory that allows 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 increase the load capacity in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.510
 market and of different types such as 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.730
 that are placed on the roof 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.100
 with five seats the capacity exceeds 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.240
 the 500 liters and with only two seats 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.890
 occupied reaches two thousand 691 liters the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.540
 second row of seats has a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.620
 automatic folding system that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.620
 Operates from the boot 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 It has two large squares 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.440
 front and the rear side are 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.600
 also spacious and comfortable the central 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.210
 back is already worse and those of the third 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.490
 row are only valid for children or for 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.440
 adults on trips not very long since 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.940
 They have little space and the area 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.940
 Fluffy seating is scarce 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.180
 the outlander has an engine 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 turbodiÃ©sel of 23 liters of displacement and 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.319
 177 horsepower maximum is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.690
 coupled to a manual gear 6 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.300
 and can have integral traction or 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.739
 4x4 which is the most advisable for 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.480
 who travel with certain frequency 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.060
 by areas with low pavement 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.040
 adhesion or front traction or 4 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 for 2 that has the advantage of a price 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.910
 more affordable and it's enough to 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.569
 circulate on asphalt or roads although 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.569
 are in poor condition 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.490
 the maximum power is obtained only 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.260
 3,500 revolutions per minute and offers 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.420
 a high torque that keeps your 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.740
 maximum value between 2,000 and 3,000 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.080
 revolutions per minute 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.110
 these figures translate into a good 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.970
 resilience and elasticity 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.150
 also the propeller enjoys a low 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.610
 sonority 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.769
 with the 4 by 2 tested it can be accelerated 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.629
 from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 97 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.209
 seconds and reach a maximum speed 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.069
 of 200 kilometers per hour a few values 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.360
 remarkable for the approach of the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.580
 vehicle 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.590
 the average consumption approved by the brand 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.600
 is 6 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.760
 our test we have measured 71 liters 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.740
 every 100 kilometers a pretty figure 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.910
 contained for a car in this 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.910
 approach and power 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.390
 everything in this mitsubishi offers a 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.430
 Solid and robust appearance and the products 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.960
 of the brand presume to visit very little 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.060
 the workshops 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.740
 the position at the wheel is good with 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.800
 seats that hold the body well and 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.510
 offer good lumbar support is counted 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.970
 also with an adequate platform of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.650
 support for the left foot the lever 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.450
 of changes is well placed and 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.670
 enjoy a remarkable visibility 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 front thanks in large part to the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.840
 elevated driving posture the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.370
 Rear visibility is not as good 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.920
 although it has the help of sensors 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.390
 proximity 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.040
 on the road offers a good 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.870
 behavior with an adequate 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.819
 compromise between efficiency and comfort of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.470
 March the body rolling in 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.239
 closed curves is correct and the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.069
 vehicle is quite agile for its size 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.150
 and weight also provides a good 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.150
 aplomb at high speeds 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.930
 It's not a pure SUV and it's not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.940
 developed to overcome areas of 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.830
 some complication does not have 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.780
 reducing gears and mounts 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.240
 low profile tires though his 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.310
 ground clearance is 21 5 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.930
 centimeters and moves smoothly by 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.960
 roads and countryside areas of good 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.210
 adherence 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.130
 The standard equipment is wide with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.380
 elements like boot assistance 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.319
 survey the double xenon headlights the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
 headlight washer speed controller 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.340
 air conditioner and a complete system of 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 audio with charger for 6 cds 9 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.060
 speakers and connections for equipment 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.020
 Auxiliary and bluetooth for the phone 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.020
