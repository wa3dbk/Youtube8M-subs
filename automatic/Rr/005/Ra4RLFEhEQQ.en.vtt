00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
right over here this is what we use in

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
right over here this is what we use in
our<00:02:07.680> show<00:02:07.950> room<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.700> operate<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> our

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
our show room to operate all of our

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.180 
our show room to operate all of our
lights<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> show<00:02:10.259> room<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
lights in the show room so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.700 
lights in the show room so
have<00:02:11.340> well<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:12.660> using<00:02:12.840> ichi<00:02:13.260> pro<00:02:13.470> rates

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
have well here I'm using ichi pro rates

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.860 
have well here I'm using ichi pro rates
of<00:02:13.950> easy<00:02:14.190> aides<00:02:14.490> i<00:02:14.850> have<00:02:15.420> an<00:02:15.540> on-off

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
of easy aides i have an on-off

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.440 
of easy aides i have an on-off
controller<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.760> unit<00:02:18.240> over

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
controller up here and this unit over

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.290 
controller up here and this unit over
here<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> DMX<00:02:19.590> controller<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.520> my

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
here I have a DMX controller and my

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.290 
here I have a DMX controller and my
amplifier<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:22.080> down<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.250> when<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:23.970> need

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
amplifier is down there so when we need

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.540 
amplifier is down there so when we need
to<00:02:24.360> operate<00:02:24.810> different<00:02:25.260> lights<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:26.190> makes<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
to operate different lights it makes it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.570 
to operate different lights it makes it
really<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.090> easy<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.280> cables<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.430> mean

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
really really easy all the cables I mean

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.120 
really really easy all the cables I mean
there<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:29.850> all<00:02:30.210> these<00:02:30.510> cables<00:02:30.960> packed<00:02:31.320> inside

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
there are all these cables packed inside

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.610 
there are all these cables packed inside
the<00:02:32.460> actual<00:02:32.580> unit<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.440> turn

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the actual unit so if you want to turn

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.150 
the actual unit so if you want to turn
something<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.850> got<00:02:36.030> simplicity<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.160> very

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
something on you got simplicity and very

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.760 
something on you got simplicity and very
portability<00:02:39.050> because<00:02:40.050> when<00:02:40.410> you're<00:02:40.560> done

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
portability because when you're done
