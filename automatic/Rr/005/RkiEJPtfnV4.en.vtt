00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 We are proud to participate in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.930
 this tournament so important for us 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.930
 It is a very nice experience 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.590
 that allows us to have more knowledge 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 of this type of tournaments 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.120
 and the quality d 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.320
 of the players of each selection of what 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.320
 which is the one we have faced 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.110
 it really leaves us very well because to 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.640
 all for everything that comes for everything 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.160
 the future and mainly knowing what 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.800
 that Paraguay has rediscovered its 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.200
 with his style his 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.210
 with your desire to recover 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.890
 in the image of some players I think 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.750
 that when we arrived the first thing that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.450
 we said and we aimed at 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.810
 retrieve the image that the team 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.660
 respect for their quality for their way of 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.340
 play by attitude I think we 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.100
 we are very happy with the players 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.750
 of the performance we have had and we are 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.330
 very happy and now surely we 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.800
 play to play either for the third place 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.110
 there 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.810
 and we are very happy to participate and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.409
 keep participating and let's hope to record 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 Both Peru and we both go to 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.500
 intend to keep the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.479
 third place 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.369
 first the third place must be played 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.070
 because we have to face a team 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.810
 that is also with the same wins with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.140
 the same enthusiasm that we have 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.159
 to conquer that place is a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.280
 football game that you have to 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.110
 get it you have to play it is going to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.909
 play with the same intensity that comes 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.450
 that is currently playing all 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.450
 the parties 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.110
 but for us we had 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.450
 goals that was very important 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.409
 the group to believe in himself again 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 that the team 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.899
 I have an order in the part of an 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.569
 it's not the football players but the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.630
 administrative in everything that the 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.129
 organizational really us that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.890
 we have organized this we are very 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.540
 satisfied with everything we have done 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.340
 we know that the level of equipment that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.390
 we have faced when we started 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 we knew what to face argentina and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.239
 uruguay and jamaica which is the last 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.760
 champion of concacaf we knew that 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.060
 We were going to have a very hard calendar 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.209
 very difficult and we had think that in that in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.730
 that stretch we already showed that the team 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.970
 to go second to compete fully 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970
 with them 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.050
 in that sense we had not given ourselves 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.269
 mind that we could fight with 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.460
 any of the teams that were 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.260
 who were playing in this tournament 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.610
 and as I go by that was 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.640
 passing the time we were giving 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.890
 also note that the team was 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.320
 whole was really really looking forward 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.230
 that he had an enthusiasm to reverse 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.120
 all kinds of situations and I think that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.920
 all the people of Paraguay and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.720
 us all we are participants 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.080
 of this tournament we are very satisfied to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.700
 we serve because 20 days 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.730
 practically we have worked with the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.590
 team and there are selections that I eat as 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.540
 we named brazil that had to go 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.210
 they have been working together for a long time 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.710
 Colombia also another of the teams that 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.230
 they have been working for a long time 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.580
 together and let's not talk about Uruguay of all 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.260
 many selections that have a lot 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.950
 more work with us for that for the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.720
 future gives us many expectations is a 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.370
 great tournament that we have made 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.670
 and of course we want to finish the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.670
 better way 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.930
 tomorrow it's going to be a great match for 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.930
