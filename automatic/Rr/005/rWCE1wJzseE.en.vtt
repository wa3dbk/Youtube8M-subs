paper<00:03:54.109> because<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.160> think<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.489> really

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
paper because I think it's really

paper because I think it's really
convenient<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.810> reason<00:03:57.170> i<00:03:57.260> like<00:03:57.440> these

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
convenient and the reason i like these

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.740 
convenient and the reason i like these
binders<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.250> they're<00:03:58.489> very<00:03:58.700> flimsy<00:03:59.180> as<00:03:59.569> you

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
binders is they're very flimsy as you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.569 
binders is they're very flimsy as you
guys<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.109> tell<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:00.980> they<00:04:01.160> don't<00:04:01.280> weigh<00:04:01.549> as

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
guys can tell so they don't weigh as

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.490 
guys can tell so they don't weigh as
much<00:04:01.760> as<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.269> normal<00:04:02.569> binders<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.260> then

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
much as the normal binders and then

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.680 
much as the normal binders and then
take<00:04:03.680> up<00:04:03.830> as<00:04:03.980> much<00:04:04.010> room<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.970> depending<00:04:05.450> on<00:04:05.570> how

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
take up as much room it depending on how

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.810
