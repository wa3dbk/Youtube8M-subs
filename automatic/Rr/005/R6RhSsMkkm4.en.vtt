how<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.260> lighten<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.730> let's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
how you can lighten some I'm so let's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
how you can lighten some I'm so let's
scrap<00:00:30.170> steel<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.619> can't<00:00:31.800> mind<00:00:32.070> seal<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
scrap steel you can't mind seal as you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
very complicated way so let's get our

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
very complicated way so let's get our
steel<00:00:36.870> pickaxe<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.640> let's<00:00:38.640> travel<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
steel pickaxe and let's travel down in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.950 
steel pickaxe and let's travel down in
our<00:00:39.300> mind<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.420> now

is it still no it is not steal you
cannot<00:00:47.219> mind<00:00:47.579> steel<00:00:48.030> steel<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> impossible<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
cannot mind steel steel is impossible to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.770 
cannot mind steel steel is impossible to
my<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.100> once<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.640> mind<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.180> makes<00:00:51.449> me<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.750> a

quite<00:00:53.699> big<00:00:53.910> veins<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.510> coal<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> once<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
quite big veins like coal so once you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.029 
quite big veins like coal so once you
mind<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.969> love<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> you'll<00:00:58.170> notice<00:00:58.620> you

you're<00:01:03.600> gonna<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.809> some<00:01:03.960> carbon<00:01:04.610> now<00:01:05.610> once

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you're gonna need some carbon now once

coal<00:01:35.920> then<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.460> get<00:01:36.610> carbon<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:40.060> we<00:01:40.119> have

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
coal then you get carbon so now we have

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.139 
coal then you get carbon so now we have
our<00:01:40.270> first<00:01:40.390> piece<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.869> melted<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.439> am<00:01:42.149> what

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
our first piece of melted I am what

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.270 
our first piece of melted I am what
about<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.509> gain<00:01:43.750> our<00:01:43.780> second<00:01:44.470> piece<00:01:44.619> now<00:01:44.830> right

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
about to gain our second piece now right

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.430 
about to gain our second piece now right
come<00:01:46.000> over<00:01:46.090> here<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.509> place<00:01:46.929> your<00:01:47.110> smelted

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
come over here and place your smelted

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.980 
come over here and place your smelted
iron<00:01:47.709> like<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.429> your<00:01:48.970> carbon<00:01:49.479> like<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.840> to

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
iron like so and your carbon like so to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.710 
iron like so and your carbon like so to
get<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.170> steel<00:01:50.679> bars<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.270> recipes<00:01:52.600> your

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
get to steel bars so the recipes your

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.240 
get to steel bars so the recipes your
steel<00:01:52.869> bars<00:01:53.080> are<00:01:53.229> exactly<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.740> same<00:01:53.770> as<00:01:53.950> what

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
steel bars are exactly the same as what

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.789 
steel bars are exactly the same as what
they'd<00:01:54.459> be<00:01:54.670> if<00:01:54.850> with<00:01:55.600> iron<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.440> make<00:01:56.470> some

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
they'd be if with iron to make some

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.779 
they'd be if with iron to make some
steel<00:01:57.100> shoes<00:01:58.560> voila<00:01:59.560> steal<00:02:00.039> shoes<00:02:00.280> I'll<00:02:00.610> put

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
steel shoes voila steal shoes I'll put

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.190 
steel shoes voila steal shoes I'll put
the<00:02:00.940> rest<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.209> my<00:02:01.299> homeroom<00:02:02.069> nigra<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:04.200> ponies

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
the rest of my homeroom nigra and ponies

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260 
the rest of my homeroom nigra and ponies
these<00:02:05.530> are<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.799> bit<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.610> think<00:02:06.850> they're<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.030> bit

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
these are a bit I think they're a bit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.600 
these are a bit I think they're a bit
faster<00:02:07.720> than<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.959> in<00:02:08.019> just<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> little<00:02:08.440> bit<00:02:08.590> but<00:02:09.280> i

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
faster than I in just a little bit but i

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.789 
faster than I in just a little bit but i
think<00:02:09.850> they<00:02:09.970> last<00:02:10.330> longer<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:11.680> bike

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
think they last longer I think bike

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.430 
think they last longer I think bike
while<00:02:12.040> I'm<00:02:12.250> not<00:02:12.549> sure

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
while I'm not sure

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.820 
while I'm not sure
so<00:02:15.160> these<00:02:15.820> tools<00:02:16.120> but<00:02:16.570> yeah<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.290> about<00:02:17.380> anion

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
so these tools but yeah that about anion

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.030 
so these tools but yeah that about anion
overall<00:02:18.790> though<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.380> give<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> metallic

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
overall though so they give a metallic

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.740 
overall though so they give a metallic
II<00:02:21.130> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.610> affect<00:02:22.030> your<00:02:22.270> character<00:02:22.720> to

steel<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:57.740> like<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.250> there<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:00.330> go<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
steel like so like so there we go to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720 
steel like so like so there we go to
make<00:03:00.810> steel<00:03:01.050> reinforced<00:03:01.590> glass<00:03:01.710> now<00:03:02.460> this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
make steel reinforced glass now this

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
make steel reinforced glass now this
looks<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.000> bit<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.420> reinforced<00:03:04.170> glass<00:03:04.290> on

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
looks a bit like the reinforced glass on

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.300 
looks a bit like the reinforced glass on
industrialcraft<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.530> does<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> bit<00:03:07.980> i'll<00:03:08.130> give
