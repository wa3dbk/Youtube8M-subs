00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 and what happens is that you will have seen the 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.740
 title of the video above that will be 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.170
 I'm sorry apologize some name like that 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.139
 something that comes to say this not that what 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.669
 I feel and let's go then we go by parts what 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.019
 first that so I say a lot to do 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.150
 what I get from the eggs always 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.830
 here on youtube and that's what my channel is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.849
 and he failed me when they want or for 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.580
 say it that way, but I'm going to do something 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.380
 that really tastes bad for us and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.110
 then not for all of you we were 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.879
 a part of you and then then I 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.129
 I want to apologize before doing it 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.680
 know that I recently started a series of 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.360
 pokemon 3 of that game at first 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.360
 person who is like a gold remake and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.829
 silver and I go for episode 2 I think that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.140
 upload the last episode of five days 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.090
 If this Christmas hits me a little 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.879
 the eggs is neither the family with the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.050
 friends and really that to upload many 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.550
 videos because in the end it ends 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.399
 fulfilling so I started quite 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 strong but in the end he has 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.660
 given a little stick and I take like six 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 days without on the video or something like that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.280
 that I have kept my 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.870
 sale of the daily video but we have good 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.240
 been growing quite these last 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.370
 days and that makes me what I was 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 de- emphasize the series of pokemon dresde 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.260
 were you already know where I'm going I do not the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 I started doing nothing very much illusion 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.070
 desire that happens here in two episodes it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.900
 It has taken away my desire, it makes me lazy 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 incredible to play the game and not 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.979
 I'm going to record something that I do not like to record 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 say I'm not going to play 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.460
 a game that I do not like to play because 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.070
 this one I play a couple of times or if very 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 cool at first but is that then 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.540
 I get bored I'll put something not to play 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 that bored me for u2 outside for me in 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.580
 I work maybe because I look 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.860
 ahead but as it is not the case as 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.340
 I can do this and you can do it if 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 I want it or not, I'm not going to do the series like that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 I'm sorry because I know a lot of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.259
 you were following the new 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.380
 greater and that did not look or had 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.090
 visits and had likes then to those who 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 I liked the series so my apologies 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.250
 because you will not enter follow 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 it was just that so I already know that I 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.520
 I have a problem with this series 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 but I promise you that if you go to see series 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.470
 in the channel now this 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.300
 is going to see a series surely we what 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.460
 You can still confirm with another person 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.870
 with another youtube that's good 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.670
 fun because to see with another person 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.080
 so yes, there may be a series 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.520
 of surprises and apart from those of these 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 series want with other people too 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.820
 there will be series of new games by 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.680
 example when the new zelda of 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.740
 will you I would like to bring a series of 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.820
 that game in a 4 or whatever because it 's 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.010
 a game that really took me 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.720
 even to play and since I like to play it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.460
 that takes advantage of the gram while I play 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.320
 but a game that I do not feel like 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.090
 play I'm not going to record it 's like that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.890
 so that means you 're going to go back 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.290
 to let pokemon upload you do not have the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.110
 you fight the videos these you 've given 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.000
 the combats using anime equipment 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.830
 of pokemon I will prepare several more 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.870
 but I want to focus a lot on the subject 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.750
 this humor because it is that if you look 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.400
 the videos that really stand out in the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.410
 channel and they are different from what it does 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 everyone are humor videos and 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.030
 others as I wanted to give an example 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.560
 the mlg folk love this I made then 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.810
 videos kind of these are the ones that I 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.849
 like to do 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.160
 so I 'm also covering 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.800
 bustillos to talk about the camera and I see 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.060
 that you do not dislike either look at me 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.220
 ugly we do not dislike giving so 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.140
 that also apologizes that merry christmas 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.090
 does not say any special nobody is at 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.650
 final and nothing happy years and I'm still 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 wanted time happy year because we're going 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.349
 we are in 2015 and may make a 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.940
 video talking about the year about what 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.980
 I thought about it and about the goals that 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
 I want to get in 2015 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.519
 that you leave the comments 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.849
 If you want you to do it, let's have a 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.010
 flattery and nothing a greeting a like if it has 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.610
 liked the video I'm sorry I repeat and nothing 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.610
 goodbye
