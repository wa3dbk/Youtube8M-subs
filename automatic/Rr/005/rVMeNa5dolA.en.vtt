come shoot we tackle a lot of the main

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.779 
come shoot we tackle a lot of the main
features<00:00:41.750> from<00:00:42.680> FIFA<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.190> people<00:00:43.460> maybe<00:00:43.579> had

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
features from FIFA that people maybe had

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.569 
features from FIFA that people maybe had
issues<00:00:44.120> with<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:44.449> a<00:00:44.480> common<00:00:45.409> one<00:00:46.100> mention<00:00:46.489> on

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
issues with so a common one mention on

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.459 
issues with so a common one mention on
the<00:00:46.640> forums<00:00:46.999> was<00:00:47.149> a<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.929> keeper<00:00:48.199> would<00:00:48.320> come

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
the forums was a the keeper would come

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.599 
the forums was a the keeper would come
out<00:00:48.589> of<00:00:48.620> his<00:00:48.769> line<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.190> could<00:00:49.399> chip<00:00:49.579> in

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
out of his line and you could chip in

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.970 
out of his line and you could chip in
quite<00:00:49.909> easily<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.359> that's<00:00:50.690> all<00:00:50.870> fixed<00:00:51.230> amongst

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
quite easily so that's all fixed amongst

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.669 
quite easily so that's all fixed amongst
all<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.460> other<00:00:52.489> major<00:00:52.789> issues<00:00:53.600> people<00:00:53.960> had<00:00:54.140> in

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
all the other major issues people had in

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.259 
all the other major issues people had in
addition<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.159> that<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.399> also<00:00:55.429> made<00:00:55.879> 100

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
addition to that we also made 100

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.520 
addition to that we also made 100
improvements<00:00:56.780> on<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.899> gameplay<00:00:57.229> engine

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
improvements on the gameplay engine

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.869 
improvements on the gameplay engine
itself<00:01:00.010> penalty<00:01:01.010> kicks<00:01:01.219> take<00:01:01.399> on<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.550> much

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
itself penalty kicks take on a much

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.459 
itself penalty kicks take on a much
bigger<00:01:02.059> importance<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.719> World<00:01:02.929> Cup<00:01:03.019> so

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
bigger importance in the World Cup so

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.930 
bigger importance in the World Cup so
there's<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.739> composer<00:01:04.100> meter<00:01:04.430> in<00:01:04.610> there<00:01:04.790> which

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
there's a composer meter in there which

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.880 
there's a composer meter in there which
will<00:01:05.089> vary<00:01:05.330> depending<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.960> who's<00:01:06.440> taking<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
will vary depending on who's taking the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.210 
will vary depending on who's taking the
kick<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> importance<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.150> kick

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
kick and the importance of the kick

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.140 
kick and the importance of the kick
depending<00:01:10.220> on<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> environment<00:01:10.640> you're

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
depending on the environment you're

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.899 
depending on the environment you're
playing<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.840> different<00:01:12.200> experience

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
playing in it's a different experience

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.340 
playing in it's a different experience
so<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.240> best<00:01:14.450> real<00:01:14.659> world<00:01:14.690> example<00:01:14.990> is

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
so that the best real world example is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.960 
so that the best real world example is
this<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.680> when<00:01:15.800> Argentina<00:01:16.370> went<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.700> Bolivia

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
this is when Argentina went to Bolivia

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.960 
this is when Argentina went to Bolivia
and<00:01:17.300> lost<00:01:17.780> 6-1<00:01:18.170> on<00:01:18.530> paper<00:01:18.770> argentina<00:01:19.460> by<00:01:19.670> far

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
and lost 6-1 on paper argentina by far

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.420 
and lost 6-1 on paper argentina by far
the<00:01:20.120> better<00:01:20.240> team<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:21.080> Bolivia's<00:01:21.380> home<00:01:22.190> games

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
the better team but Bolivia's home games

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.890 
the better team but Bolivia's home games
are<00:01:22.550> played<00:01:22.580> at<00:01:22.730> such<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.000> high<00:01:23.180> altitude<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.780> La

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
are played at such a high altitude in La

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.560 
are played at such a high altitude in La
Paz<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.520> know<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.730> stamina<00:01:26.240> is

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
Paz that the the you know the stamina is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.790 
Paz that the the you know the stamina is
a<00:01:26.600> different<00:01:26.960> kettle<00:01:27.050> of<00:01:27.260> fish<00:01:27.320> playing<00:01:27.680> at

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
a different kettle of fish playing at

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.680 
a different kettle of fish playing at
high<00:01:27.980> altitude<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.760> stamina<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.210> drain<00:01:29.480> it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
high altitude so the stamina is drain it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.200 
high altitude so the stamina is drain it
a<00:01:29.780> lot<00:01:29.930> drains<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.800> lot<00:01:30.830> more<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.640> ball<00:01:31.850> physics

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
a lot drains a lot more the ball physics

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.940 
a lot drains a lot more the ball physics
are<00:01:32.360> very<00:01:32.510> slightly<00:01:32.900> subtly<00:01:33.410> affected<00:01:33.830> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
are very slightly subtly affected and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.230 
are very slightly subtly affected and
we've<00:01:34.040> kind<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.340> captured<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:34.880> level<00:01:35.180> of

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
we've kind of captured that level of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.890 
we've kind of captured that level of
detail<00:01:35.300> in<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.870> world<00:01:36.020> corporation

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
detail in the world corporation

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.450 
detail in the world corporation
we've<00:01:38.900> done<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> great<00:01:39.440> new<00:01:39.590> feature<00:01:39.860> which<00:01:40.310> is

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
we've done a great new feature which is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.460 
we've done a great new feature which is
two<00:01:40.610> button<00:01:40.850> controls<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.810> takes<00:01:41.990> all<00:01:42.260> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
two button controls so it takes all the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.920 
two button controls so it takes all the
complexity<00:01:43.040> of<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.340> normal<00:01:43.940> control<00:01:44.570> system

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
complexity of the normal control system

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.690 
complexity of the normal control system
