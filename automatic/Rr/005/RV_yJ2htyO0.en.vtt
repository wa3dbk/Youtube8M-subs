the 5750 257 conversion Terry Muller got

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.570 
the 5750 257 conversion Terry Muller got
them<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:15.000> me<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:16.320> those<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.560> long<00:00:16.920> magnet

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
them for me and those are long magnet

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.620 
them for me and those are long magnet
typical<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.810> 59<00:00:19.500> pas<00:00:20.070> lots<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.510> of

growl great double tones and these are

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
growl great double tones and these are
sort<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> opposite<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> antithesis

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sort of the opposite of the antithesis

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
of those visa or nineteen sixty pas and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
of those visa or nineteen sixty pas and
they<00:00:31.800> were<00:00:31.859> sold<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> me<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.640> long<00:00:32.850> magnet

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
they were sold to me as long magnet

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889 
they were sold to me as long magnet
because<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.890> resistance<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.610> eight<00:00:36.450> point

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because the resistance is eight point

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.440 
because the resistance is eight point
three<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.620> seven<00:00:37.920> 16<00:00:38.520> which<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> little

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
three and seven 16 which is a little

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.470 
three and seven 16 which is a little
higher<00:00:39.690> than<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> typical<00:00:40.290> resistance<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
higher than the typical resistance of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
higher than the typical resistance of
known<00:00:42.950> 1960<00:00:43.950> short<00:00:44.219> magnet<00:00:44.670> pickups<00:00:45.260> PS<00:00:46.260> but

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
known 1960 short magnet pickups PS but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.389 
known 1960 short magnet pickups PS but
anyway<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.020> nice<00:00:49.289> sweet<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> clear

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
anyway these have a nice sweet and clear

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610 
anyway these have a nice sweet and clear
sound<00:00:50.700> out<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.910> output<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.870> these<00:00:52.440> aren't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
sound out the output is it these aren't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
sound out the output is it these aren't
nearly<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.010> loud<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:53.760> pickups

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
nearly as loud as the other pickups

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
nearly as loud as the other pickups
that's<00:00:54.719> why<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> sort<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> assume<00:00:55.770> they're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that's why I sort of assume they're

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.760 
that's why I sort of assume they're
short<00:00:56.309> magnet<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.420> who<00:00:57.570> knows<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
short magnet but who knows but they do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
short magnet but who knows but they do
sound<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.850> different<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.390> sweet<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
sound a lot different they're sweet and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.310 
sound a lot different they're sweet and
claire<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.059> remain<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.449> even<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> lot<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
claire and remain so even with a lot of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.950 
claire and remain so even with a lot of
game<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> play<00:01:06.659> through<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
game so okay a play through the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000 
game so okay a play through the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.780 
blackface deluxe reverb again finds on a
little<00:01:11.340> over<00:01:11.580> four<00:01:11.930> treble<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> six<00:01:13.560> basis<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
little over four treble is six basis for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
little over four treble is six basis for
and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.180> turn<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> river<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and I turn down the river and that's on

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:33.420 
and I turn down the river and that's on
about<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.640> effects<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.720> all

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this see how Flutie this a neck pickup

00:02:10.170 --> 00:04:37.960 
this see how Flutie this a neck pickup
is<00:02:10.710> on<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.220> one

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.580 

anyway<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> think<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.509> one<00:04:39.780> oh<00:04:40.050> yeah<00:04:40.319> really

does have that charm it's a lot more
melodic<00:04:43.590> signing<00:04:44.189> than<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.460> other<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.789> other

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
melodic signing than the other the other

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.080 
melodic signing than the other the other
one<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.129> little<00:04:47.129> bit<00:04:47.219> more<00:04:47.370> forceful<00:04:48.060> in

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
one is a little bit more forceful in

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.800 
one is a little bit more forceful in
times<00:04:48.449> great<00:04:49.340> with<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.370> band<00:04:50.819> and<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.569> cuts

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
times great with a band and it cuts

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.570 
times great with a band and it cuts
through<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.110> real<00:04:52.770> well<00:04:52.979> but<00:04:53.159> this<00:04:53.340> one<00:04:53.550> just

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
through a real well but this one just

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.780 
through a real well but this one just
sounds<00:04:54.120> real<00:04:54.389> pretty
