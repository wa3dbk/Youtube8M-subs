 how do you balance your life

 artistic your professional life with what 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.450
 I personally think that the time of my 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.160
 career where do I have to learn to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.120
 handle that I think for example 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.560
 Now that we are here in Medellin 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.720

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.430
 my family but nothing is work there what 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.470
 I left at home calm and now I come 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.430
 to work and right now I come back I think 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.490
 what is to try to find that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.490
 Balance 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.060
 what things are coming for this rest of the year 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.069
 a lot of music a lot of music to follow 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.939

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.980
 that is coming is a lot of soul too much 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.719
 turn also the voice hits that it's going to be 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.609
 some of the hits I'm going to present the 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.620
 kids choice awards and good and 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.680
 let's see that speck of presenter 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.750
 that you have and it has been something intense no longer 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.910
 you have let's say controlled I think it's 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.530
 some innate talent in you yes I believe 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.940
 that is something quite naturally medium 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.090
 always tried to be like I am not 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.800
 try to pretend suddenly that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.690
 nothing will be the presenter of the awards 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.090
 and to parties to secure or do only 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590
 I will not kill like done to 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.250
 another person will face us and 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.250
 simply me 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.460
 I want to send a greeting in particular to 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.020

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.020
 part of football to the house 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.580
 I'm with left sanz 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.039
 Organization manager 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.250
 international tourism which is that 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.289
 stamp that puts the oit in at a point 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.930
 well representative throughout the market 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.680
 of the quinceañeras I think it's the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.470
 passion the fact that we like that a 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.470
 quinceañera live that feeling of being 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.539
 in the country that you have chosen in the 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.930
 excursion you have chosen and I think 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.099
 that today has that essence 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.430
 definitely because it's good to perform 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:49.569

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.759
 family and with all the girls gathered 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.740
 in one place is a reunion one 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.840
 thing is when you have lived of those 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.300
