now<00:00:34.100> I'm<00:00:34.250> going<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.489> make<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:34.670> little

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
now I'm going to make a little

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.390 
now I'm going to make a little
3-dimensional<00:00:35.870> pic<00:00:36.140> using<00:00:36.860> my<00:00:36.980> guide<00:00:37.160> to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
sizes the body is size egg and I need

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.660 
sizes the body is size egg and I need
four<00:00:41.030> feet<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.930> are<00:00:41.960> size<00:00:42.320> F<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.280> check<00:00:43.519> each

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
four feet that are size F so check each

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.820 
four feet that are size F so check each

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
shape into a nice round ball and put

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.310 
shape into a nice round ball and put
them<00:00:49.100> into<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.369> square<00:00:52.809> now<00:00:53.809> generally

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320

everything<00:00:54.559> will<00:00:54.890> stick<00:00:55.159> by<00:00:55.369> itself<00:00:55.729> if<00:00:56.299> you

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
everything will stick by itself if you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.939 
everything will stick by itself if you
find<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.049> bits<00:00:57.229> of<00:00:57.379> your<00:00:57.500> sugar<00:00:57.739> placed

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
find the bits of your sugar placed

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.410 
find the bits of your sugar placed
aren't<00:00:58.369> sticking<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.879> each<00:00:58.909> other

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
aren't sticking to each other

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.229 
aren't sticking to each other
you<00:00:59.689> can<00:00:59.869> just<00:01:00.019> use<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.229> little<00:01:00.589> bit<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.830> water

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
you can just use a little bit of water

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.359 
you can just use a little bit of water
and<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.360> water<00:01:02.510> brush<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.559> just<00:01:03.769> dab<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:03.979> bit<00:01:04.100> on

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and a water brush and just dab a bit on

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.429 
and a water brush and just dab a bit on
and<00:01:04.729> that's<00:01:04.970> fine<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.780> you'll<00:01:05.930> probably<00:01:06.110> find

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
and that's fine but you'll probably find

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.350 
and that's fine but you'll probably find
that<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.740> does<00:01:06.920> stick<00:01:07.159> by<00:01:07.310> itself<00:01:07.610> for<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
that it does stick by itself for the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.109 
that it does stick by itself for the
body<00:01:08.540> size<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:09.200> shape<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.070> into<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.340> very<00:01:10.670> short

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
body size a shape it into a very short

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.110 
body size a shape it into a very short
sausage<00:01:11.840> shape<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:12.680> pop<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.790> down<00:01:13.970> on

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
sausage shape like that pop it down on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.390 
sausage shape like that pop it down on
top<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.330> those<00:01:14.540> feet<00:01:14.920> press<00:01:15.920> down<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.370> the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
top of those feet press down in the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.880 
top of those feet press down in the
corners<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.090> he<00:01:17.510> picks<00:01:17.750> his<00:01:17.960> feet<00:01:18.170> up<00:01:18.380> and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
corners and he picks his feet up and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.790 
corners and he picks his feet up and
there<00:01:19.100> they<00:01:19.220> are<00:01:19.250> stuck<00:01:19.640> in<00:01:19.790> place<00:01:20.620> we<00:01:21.620> make<00:01:21.770> a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
there they are stuck in place we make a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.200 
there they are stuck in place we make a
little<00:01:21.980> dent<00:01:22.250> there<00:01:22.610> at<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.820> front<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
otherwise he looks along the cake which

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.870

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
snout is a ball of icing size G you

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.510 
snout is a ball of icing size G you
squash<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.010> flatten<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:55.159> that

squash it on and flatten it like that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.060 
squash it on and flatten it like that
and<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.450> using<00:01:56.780> your<00:01:56.810> PME<00:01:57.290> number<00:01:57.560> 9<00:01:57.770> tool

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
and then using your PME number 9 tool

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.430 
and then using your PME number 9 tool
you<00:01:58.729> want<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.090> two<00:01:59.540> big<00:01:59.750> holes<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.320> now

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440
