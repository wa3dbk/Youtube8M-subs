00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.480
 ok so I see we are 20 videos 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.580
 and over 2h40 of courses on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 compressors and I hope these 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.660
 machines no longer have to jump 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 for you I would still like to add 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 a 21st video because I would like you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 talk about a discussion that I had about 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 the forum with a member of the site 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 training home studio point en baptiste 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 and drummer and we traded on the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.189
 sound recording of his acoustic drums 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 and mixing 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.150
 he sent me his tracks and I would like 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 show you how to mix a battery 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 acoustic that you would have recorded 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 at home so with simple plugins 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 that is, without using the arsenal of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 vintage plugins only at detailed in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.740
 previous videos 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.640
 so I'm going first you play the mix 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.640
 as I am now 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:10.950
 here and the same thing without effect without 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:12.960
 the plugins without dreams either good 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.550
 it's just a little reverb and without 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.550
 nothing on purpose this masters 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.759
 this is then see what I did in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.690
 The detail 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:42.280
 so let's start with the kick the first 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.409
 thing I did is put a 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.080
 gates so we'll see the gates in the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.399
 detail but it helps to clean the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.399
 buckets and hear that bass drum 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.640
 so what about the compressor 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.649
 I used my ass butt technical 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.890
 to mount the trick attacks she 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.009
 lacked attac 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.119
 so that's what makes sense and with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.119
 so without 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.570
 so I have an attac time of 22000 10 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.640
 seconds to let pass the tacc the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.940
 kick that is actually the impact of the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 junta bat in 2010 quite short since 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.390
 I like the compressor 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 react fairly quickly and at the level 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.520
 very hot and well I went down 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.140
 very hot until you have enough 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080
 and still not completely 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.710
 smothered the resonance and the bass so 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.710
 That's what happens 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.950
 so that's what labatt 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.560
 that's all together and then I saw 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.830
 between the two to bring out this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.830
 impact 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.030
 so obviously his cut to a little bit 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.550
 the grave so I was looking for a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.810
 equalizer so I took the one to 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.230
 built into the software and I did not hurt 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.540
 Frequency Research First 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.950
 I cut the low end because 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.200
 there is a track of what will happen 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.900
 just now so she's going to 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.060
 bring back the only serious so much the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.340
 cut on the microphone in the main for 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.200
 let it be clearer more distinct 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.110
 that it does not add up 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.180
 do not mix it can make a result 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:50.000
 a little rough I boosted the 55 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.690
 hertz that is to say 55 60 55 to 60 3 hertz 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.290
 it's actually the fat the boom of the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.680
 bass drum 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.430
 yes just one precision for seven 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.450
 low frequencies 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.510
 I wish I had a high pass filter 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.630
 but the problem is that the filter 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.840
 pass high and very very little steep in 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.940
 this equalizer set there and so I 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.270
 wanted a much stronger code 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.980
 so I took the parametric and 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.450
 I was going to the lowest possible 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.720
 what you see if I go up bah in 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.190
 done is a parametric 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.650
 that is to say that normally it serves to 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.570
 booster or next to the frequencies but there 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.580
 I listened to him thoroughly and I went down to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.640
 0 I only use the slope 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.870
 so here is a trick to settle 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.660
 the odds 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.260
 and switch to low-pass when you have not 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.160
 really a proper cut ok so let's get back 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.580
 at this frequency this is normally that 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.000
 would have given that to say of booster 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.920
 the bass around 55 kert between 55 and 60 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.430
 hertz 65 hertz same and then I have a 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.730
 little boosted treble to hear the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.530
 the impact always of demas beats then 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.000
 that's what makes sense and then I 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.180
 added to show you the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.180
 difference 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.420
 so that's good because I won 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.570
 gained in roundness and I gained clarity 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.850
 but I also gained a frequency that 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.740
 I do not particularly like it and I 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.970
 asked for a moment what it was 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.300
 that this frequency I ended up the 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.640
 find 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.270
 so the voice if I boost it for the 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.270
 to hear 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.610
 maybe reduce my loop 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.560
 because each time there is the break on 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.099
 will use the break for the volumes 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.099
 but not for now 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.800
 so so with this if I do not cut 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.940
 this frequency not it's a little you 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.770
 but hey, I would like his wife to tell you 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.550
 even in serious balances not in 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.340
 this frequency has it so here I was 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.639
 forced to stitch this frequency 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.990
 to mitigate it, it actually means 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.990
 especially when everything is mixed
