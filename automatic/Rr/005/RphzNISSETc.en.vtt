00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:09.700
 Hello I joined the Arts Department 22 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:16.779
 A 17-year-old woman , 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:21.220
 So many reviews and did not give ah today in this position Yan Fiji and several 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.450
 Take the other one and the unlimited column from the pda where you are in charge of the program 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.730
 Through 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:32.169
 I want to say hello to you. 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:38.320
 It's a guy who's doing a program to win a gag concert. 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:41.710
 What do you want to write about? 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.730
 Since I bought the first place in the city ​​hall, many beautiful beetles 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.960
 Nowadays, there are a number of different ways 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 Because of the situation, I have not been able to complete the inverse. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.410
 In fact, those who try to control the viewer kid is created by the tip of the pd 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.420
 Please think of some kind of service as the best we have to do 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:09.670
 Work and what to do 0 Step 4 what they look like in the second half 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:15.399
 In no idea that not it illumines the inconvenience You take control of discomfort 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:21.399
 Kill me now or what's too visa kbs rfc 5 degrees their own 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:25.719
 By flow along these two days in order to assess the various Disclosing the story 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:29.229
 I think it's like that. 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.979
 We wanted to talk so we thought we wanted to apologize . 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.090
 so 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.619
 Geureongeo there are various views on the strike on strike for 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 Nothing less than a minute you know and uncomfortable about what that means to meet with us. 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.630
 I think it gives the program more tons 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.790
 Even if you do not see the subject program when you see the kg in front of you, 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.720
 As jundamyeon now called the split end to say that using poison ahjeo 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.220
 About the Word 2 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.470
 I do not think it's over yet. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.149
 Ah but some questions may now be a different story for the question. What terms 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 Participation 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:14.100
 So Suzanne decided to go to a concert program 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:18.630
 National production method pair Wikipedia ppajindago people do not get enough to broadcast 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 Then I scratched the expression system is not so when I saw the word expert 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.670
 This one little word that's not nearly trillion of expression, however, that the weak c 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.380
 But I think overall to maintain the existing laugh now 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 I think there is. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:39.540
 If you are asking for the alienation that caused you to participate in such a pd position, 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 Kbs l geusae union I belong now, the unions affiliated to the media 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:51.329
 Uh, our union is pledged. We are weak. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.570
 It is a very 13 days in terms of the number of people in that ks . 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:59.519
 When you say you're making a convoy, 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:04.260
 The situation that I can get out effectively has gone on and on. 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.470
 In fact, good discipline for the strike was in 2010 as a result of one or 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 When you see the development of some necks down 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.630
 In fact, for the part that I am in front of the second question as one of the entertainment pd 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.019
 I do not think it's possible to do that. 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.190
 In terms of content, I really feel like I never felt 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.390
 I did not. 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.040
 But that word two minutes alone together out any talk c lack of any interest 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.910
 The people say, but there are also temples where the applause is given . 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.170
 I think it's the latter that I'm applying the right skull. 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.390
 I was so quiet that I was not so worried about that part. 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:48.420
 The biggest moment to decide that this farm should win is 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:52.810
 Through the union, pd and reporters talk about what to build and what voice to talk to 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.739
 I read that the voices are right about someone I think is right 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.400
 Give something opportunity together with something that you are working with . 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:04.989
 There should be a place to go, but not one way 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 If the structure continues to have one side in the atmosphere, the conspiracy 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.200
 I came because I thought that it was not a match. 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.489
 Because it came out in the name of pda in Daegu , 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.690
 Michilkka impact as an image, a striking look at a word a little bit burdensome 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.639
 I did not have a face . 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:27.669
 I am just programming programmer groups only 22 kbs pd the appearance 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:29.590
 These days, just a motivation to strike up As one of the members strive to Sumi 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.229
 I just wanted to tell Suzie . 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.229
 That can be filled by Jobs.
