00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
package that I got I got this is the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
package that I got I got this is the
Brazilian<00:01:21.869> natural<00:01:22.380> wavelength<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.790> went

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
Brazilian natural wavelength and I went

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
Brazilian natural wavelength and I went
ahead<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> curled<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.590> bit

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
ahead and curled it just a little bit

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
ahead and curled it just a little bit
with<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> long<00:01:26.310> curler<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.960> really

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
with the long curler but it really

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.270 
with the long curler but it really
doesn't<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.100> difference

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
doesn't make that much of a difference

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
doesn't make that much of a difference
like<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.750> curls<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.290> be

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
like it your your curls are gonna be

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.640 
like it your your curls are gonna be
fuller<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.990> when<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> comes<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
fuller but it's not when it comes to you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.819 
fuller but it's not when it comes to you
as<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.340> natural<00:01:38.850> wave<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.530> pretty

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
as the the natural wave is really pretty

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.810 
as the the natural wave is really pretty
so<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.229> condition<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.790> wash<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so like if you condition it and wash it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480 
so like if you condition it and wash it
and<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.259> gonna<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.619> pre<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.100> didn't

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and go like it's gonna be pre I didn't

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
and go like it's gonna be pre I didn't
like<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:47.759> big<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> was<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> first

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.530 
like how big it was like when I first
got<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.610> didn't<00:01:50.970> curl<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.329> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
got it and I didn't curl and I just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.649 
got it and I didn't curl and I just
sewed<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.740> big<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:54.149> felt<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.630> a
