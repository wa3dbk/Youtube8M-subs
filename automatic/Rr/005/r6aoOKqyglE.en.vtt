he says it was actually a polygon

isn't<00:01:51.869> necessarily<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.500> clear<00:01:52.860> improvement

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
isn't necessarily a clear improvement

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
isn't necessarily a clear improvement
when<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.090> talking<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.600> 30<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> 60

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

when you're talking about 30 and 60
frames<00:01:55.829> per<00:01:55.950> second<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:57.149> one<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
frames per second I for one think that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350 
frames per second I for one think that
120<00:01:58.680> frames<00:01:58.890> per<00:01:59.040> second<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> ideal

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
120 frames per second is the ideal

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
120 frames per second is the ideal
target<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> shoot<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.740> are

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
target to shoot for and I know there are

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
target to shoot for and I know there are
games<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> cap<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.549> 60<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
games the cap at 60 but if you can get a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.780 
games the cap at 60 but if you can get a
game<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.229> run<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.469> 120<00:02:04.950> you've<00:02:05.310> got<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> very

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
game to run at 120 you've got a very

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
game to run at 120 you've got a very
very<00:02:06.119> very<00:02:06.240> small<00:02:06.869> input<00:02:07.320> lag<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
very very small input lag and then it's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.169 
very very small input lag and then it's
all<00:02:08.099> down<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.489> display<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.090> your

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
all down to your display and your

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.520 
all down to your display and your
internet<00:02:09.479> connection<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.080> point<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
internet connection at that point and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
internet connection at that point and
again<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.370> another<00:02:11.610> reason<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> PC

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
again this is another reason to get a PC

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
again this is another reason to get a PC
because<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> PC

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
because a PC

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.770 
because a PC
if<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.890> build<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.280> big<00:02:14.490> enough<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.420> 60

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
if you build it big enough can get 60

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.320 
if you build it big enough can get 60
FPS<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.010> 120<00:02:17.730> FPS<00:02:18.150> in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
FPS can get you know up to 120 FPS in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330 
FPS can get you know up to 120 FPS in
some<00:02:18.480> cases<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.590> high<00:02:19.800> resolution

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
some cases you can have high resolution

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.280 
some cases you can have high resolution
textures<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.060> fluid<00:02:21.480> motion<00:02:21.870> but

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
textures you can have fluid motion but

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
textures you can have fluid motion but
you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.250> frame<00:02:23.550> rate<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
you can also have that frame rate that

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.060 
you can also have that frame rate that
resolution<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.380> everything<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
resolution you can get everything with a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.310 
resolution you can get everything with a
PC<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.270> get<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.570> game<00:02:27.810> for

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
PC and then you can get the game for

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.930 
PC and then you can get the game for
cheaper<00:02:28.710> than<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.340> console<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
cheaper than you can on a console and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.550 
cheaper than you can on a console and
that's<00:02:30.060> why<00:02:30.390> i<00:02:30.420> choose<00:02:30.720> pc<00:02:31.110> gaming<00:02:31.320> because

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that's why i choose pc gaming because

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
that's why i choose pc gaming because
even<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> little<00:02:32.850> bit<00:02:33.000> more

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
even if it is a little bit more

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.880 
even if it is a little bit more
expensive<00:02:33.420> at<00:02:33.720> first<00:02:33.960> it's<00:02:34.170> objectively<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
expensive at first it's objectively the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
expensive at first it's objectively the
best<00:02:35.010> thing<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.640> game<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.180> thing<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.540> i

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
best thing to game up one thing that i

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.150 
best thing to game up one thing that i
kind<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.080> want<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.320> dismiss<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.740> little<00:02:38.040> bit

from gaming vault I I found that there

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.280 
from gaming vault I I found that there
are<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.330> people<00:02:45.480> saying<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.020> oh<00:02:46.080> this

means that PlayStation 4 games are going
to<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.330> really<00:02:48.570> good<00:02:48.840> graphics<00:02:49.500> and

right<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:02.880> he's<00:03:03.390> actually<00:03:03.630> mostly<00:03:04.080> working

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
right now he's actually mostly working

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.730 
right now he's actually mostly working
on<00:03:04.530> ice<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> PSS<00:03:05.580> lapi<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.290> doesn't

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
on ice and the PSS lapi so it doesn't

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.100 
on ice and the PSS lapi so it doesn't
really<00:03:07.890> mean<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:09.090> he<00:03:09.300> has<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.690> authority<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
really mean that he has the authority to

really mean that he has the authority to
make<00:03:10.320> something<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.070> 1080p<00:03:11.640> 30fps

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
make something be you know 1080p 30fps

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.630 
make something be you know 1080p 30fps
this<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.410> means<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.740> this<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.040> his<00:03:14.250> idea<00:03:14.280> of

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
this just means that this is his idea of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.340 
this just means that this is his idea of
what<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> game<00:03:15.210> should<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.810> that's<00:03:15.990> that's

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
what a game should be and that's that's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.380 
what a game should be and that's that's
a<00:03:16.500> very<00:03:16.710> important<00:03:17.310> thing<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.700> know<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.270> you're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
a very important thing to know if you're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.850 
a very important thing to know if you're
going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.570> start<00:03:18.780> firing<00:03:19.020> off<00:03:19.260> opinions<00:03:19.770> like

going to start firing off opinions like

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.170 
going to start firing off opinions like
the<00:03:20.040> PlayStation<00:03:20.520> 4<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.150> all

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
games that are really good looking but

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.620 
games that are really good looking but
30fps<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.520> future<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:23.940> not

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
30fps in the future because not

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.690 
30fps in the future because not
necessarily<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.470> probably<00:03:25.950> not<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:26.430> gamers

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
necessarily and probably not if gamers

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.280 
necessarily and probably not if gamers
want<00:03:27.000> framerate<00:03:27.270> gamers<00:03:27.750> will<00:03:27.900> get<00:03:28.050> framerate

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
want framerate gamers will get framerate

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.110 
want framerate gamers will get framerate
a<00:03:28.470> frame<00:03:28.770> rate<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.040> better<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.820> will<00:03:29.970> get

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
a frame rate is better that we will get

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.400 
a frame rate is better that we will get
for<00:03:30.330> they<00:03:30.420> will<00:03:30.540> get<00:03:30.660> frame<00:03:30.900> rate<00:03:31.080> or<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> can

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
for they will get frame rate or you can

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.680 
for they will get frame rate or you can
just<00:03:31.500> build<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:31.770> pc<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.250> regardless<00:03:33.000> he<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
just build a pc but regardless he is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.900 
just build a pc but regardless he is
working<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.140> api<00:03:34.410> he<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.160> working<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.610> ice

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
working on the api he is working on ice

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.270 
working on the api he is working on ice
and<00:03:36.300> he<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.110> programmer<00:03:37.710> at<00:03:37.890> Naughty<00:03:38.070> Dog

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and he is a programmer at Naughty Dog

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.670 
and he is a programmer at Naughty Dog
but<00:03:38.460> he's<00:03:38.610> not<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.760> major<00:03:39.380> probably<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> major

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
but he's not a major probably a major

guessing<00:03:43.110> would<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.350> doing<00:03:43.590> tweaking<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.490> get

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
guessing would be doing tweaking to get

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
guessing would be doing tweaking to get
what<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.630> managers<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> program<00:03:46.800> would

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
what the managers of the program would

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.760 
what the managers of the program would
want<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.520> you're<00:03:48.240> 60<00:03:48.630> FPS<00:03:49.020> potential<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.560> safe

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770
