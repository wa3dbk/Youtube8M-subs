00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.900
 the wonderful fishing 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.590
 One day Jesus was on the lake shore. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.720
 of Galilee there were many people to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 pressing around him to hear the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.529
 Word of God Jesus saw two boats in the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.880
 lake near fishermen's beach 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.570
 had left them were taking the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 networks 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.270
 Jesus entered one of the ships that was 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 and asked him to withdraw a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 little silver landmark 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 Then Jesus sat on the boat and started 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.020
 to teach him when he just spoke 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 said to 5 take the boat further 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 from the beach where the lake is shorter after 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.350
 You guys play the networks. 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 for fishing 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 Simon replied master. 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.830
 we worked all night and did not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 we lose nothing, since you are 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.290
 Tell me, I'm going to play the networks. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.979
 then Simon and his companions went to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 farther from the beach and threw the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.350
 caught so much fish that the nets were 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 almost breaking 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 so they signaled to the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.790
 fellows on the other boat 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 to help 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.680
 they went and filled the two boats with 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 so much fish that the boats almost sink 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 when Simon Pedro saw what he had 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 happened to juliÃ£o if at the feet of jesus 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.799
 and said sir, if you leave me, I am 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.790
 one sinner and the other 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.040
 his companions were left with 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.149
 amazed at the large amount of fish 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.610
 who had caught James and John the son 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.950
 of Zebedeu who were companions of 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.580
 Simon also got very 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.459
 admired and jesus said above have not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.530
 fear from now on you will be 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.379
 fisherman of people 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.480
 so they dragged the boats to 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:30.930
 Brian left everything and went with Jesus and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.769
 We are fishing people or we should 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.879
 first to fish ourselves to 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.510
 believe in our higher self than 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.510
 and God
