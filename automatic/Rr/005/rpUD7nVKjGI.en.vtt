out with the same basic layout and you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
out with the same basic layout and you
can<00:00:59.910> set<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.329> yourself<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.079> well<00:01:01.289> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can set that up yourself as well so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.229 
can set that up yourself as well so
let's<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.190> ahead<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.370> solve<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.699> problem<00:01:02.850> we

said present value is what we need to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.750 
said present value is what we need to
know<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.760> number<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> periods<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
know we don't know number of periods and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.200 
know we don't know number of periods and
next<00:01:08.760> year<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.900> only<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.470> year<00:01:11.150> not<00:01:12.150> a

PV which is present value

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.969 
PV which is present value
we'll<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.659> nice<00:01:51.869> dialog<00:01:52.439> box<00:01:52.740> now

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we'll get this nice dialog box now

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380 
we'll get this nice dialog box now
there's<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.280> couple<00:01:53.460> ways<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.909> enter<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's a couple ways you can enter the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
there's a couple ways you can enter the
information<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.189> enter<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> rate

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
information here you can enter the rate

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.359 
information here you can enter the rate
by<00:01:57.689> clicking<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> doing<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> cell<00:01:58.920> reference

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
by clicking and doing the cell reference

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.780 
by clicking and doing the cell reference
so<00:01:59.840> c8<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.229> becomes<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> reference<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
so c8 now becomes the reference for the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
so c8 now becomes the reference for the
rate<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.210> any<00:02:03.390> changes<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> make<00:02:04.170> over<00:02:04.320> here

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
rate so any changes I make over here

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
rate so any changes I make over here
will<00:02:05.340> automatically<00:02:06.119> update<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> formula

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
will automatically update in the formula

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.040 
will automatically update in the formula

what the actual amount we would have to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.670 
what the actual amount we would have to
save<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:47.460> every<00:02:48.460> month<00:02:49.000> would<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:50.410> make

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
save up every month would be to make

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.220 
save up every month would be to make
sure<00:02:50.710> we<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.340> money<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:52.930> case

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
sure we have that money so in this case

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.100 
sure we have that money so in this case
the<00:02:53.470> present<00:02:53.860> value<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.280> zero<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:54.760> we're

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the present value is zero because we're

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.990 
the present value is zero because we're
penniless<00:02:56.110> which<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.800> quite<00:02:57.070> often<00:02:57.430> true<00:02:57.850> of

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
penniless which is quite often true of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.020 
penniless which is quite often true of
college<00:02:58.330> student<00:02:58.720> n<00:02:59.010> would<00:03:00.010> still<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.490> 100

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
college student n would still be 100

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.950 
college student n would still be 100
we'll<00:03:01.750> make<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:01.990> 12<00:03:02.380> we'll<00:03:02.560> make<00:03:02.710> 12<00:03:02.980> payments

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
we'll make it 12 we'll make 12 payments

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.770 
we'll make it 12 we'll make 12 payments
interest<00:03:04.960> rate<00:03:05.170> we<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.590> still<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:06.010> 7%<00:03:06.780> so

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
interest rate we can still get 7% so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.780 
interest rate we can still get 7% so
let's<00:03:07.990> go<00:03:08.200> ahead<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.410> enter<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.950> 7%

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
let's go ahead and enter the 7%

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.270 
let's go ahead and enter the 7%
but<00:03:10.330> we<00:03:10.720> would<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.230> monthly<00:03:11.770> because<00:03:12.070> we

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
but we would get that monthly because we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.040 
but we would get that monthly because we
would<00:03:12.489> be<00:03:12.670> depositing<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.420> into<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
would be depositing that into the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.350 
would be depositing that into the
account<00:03:14.410> every<00:03:14.770> month<00:03:14.800> so<00:03:15.760> we'll<00:03:15.910> divide<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
account every month so we'll divide that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.800 
account every month so we'll divide that
by<00:03:16.570> 12<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.459> payment<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.300> case<00:03:19.360> would<00:03:19.780> be

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
by 12 the payment in this case would be

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.160 
by 12 the payment in this case would be
the<00:03:19.959> unknown<00:03:20.290> future<00:03:21.250> value<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.670> $400<00:03:22.630> so

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
the unknown future value of $400 so

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.840 
the unknown future value of $400 so
let's<00:03:23.350> come<00:03:23.560> down<00:03:23.739> here<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.160> see<00:03:24.459> if<00:03:24.550> we<00:03:24.610> can

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
let's come down here and see if we can

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.110 
let's come down here and see if we can
figure<00:03:25.060> out<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.510> payment<00:03:25.959> amount<00:03:26.230> financial

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
figure out that payment amount financial

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.300 
figure out that payment amount financial
come<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.420> PMT<00:03:29.410> scrooge<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.640> over<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.810> rate

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
come to PMT scrooge that over the rate

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.790 
come to PMT scrooge that over the rate
you<00:03:33.310> let<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.880> calculating<00:03:34.720> number<00:03:35.680> of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
you let it do the calculating number of

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.250 
you let it do the calculating number of
periods<00:03:36.220> would<00:03:36.489> be<00:03:36.670> now<00:03:36.880> 12<00:03:37.360> present<00:03:37.959> value

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
periods would be now 12 present value

zero future value $400 look at that it

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.699 
zero future value $400 look at that it
looks<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.550> we<00:03:42.670> would<00:03:42.850> have<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.120> deposit<00:03:43.709> $32

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
looks like we would have to deposit $32
