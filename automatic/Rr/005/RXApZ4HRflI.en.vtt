00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 new professor pc video in this video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:20.189
 I would like to give you a free one 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:21.660
 ssh client for windows host so look 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.680
 First of all a little bit the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.570
 frame condition 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 We need, as I said a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 Free ssh for windows is supposed to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 example of the baby so that hermann 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.809
 Running below 2000 would probably 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 also still running but I think that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.910
 many of my viewers still - 2000 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 use 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.480
 Now we have the problem that under 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 windows by default no hair dryer 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 preinstalled 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 this is for example under mac os or linux the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.090
 case but and the windows just not for 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 can solve that I show as I said in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 this video and for now distance 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.559
 the more translated windows brings 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.750
 no integrated ssh client from sap 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.680
 so you have to have one yourself 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.170
 download 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 I will use only profi for this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 Totti is not only my absolute 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 favorite what ssh client also concerns many 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 other users in this dress so um 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 the download now is natural 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.189
 absolutely free opens are standard 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 web browser and up Munich 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.540
 we are much forwarded to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.060
 official good the download page 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.560
 Scroll down special pieces 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 we see here for windows 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.380
 trees of course the latest version 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.479
 he in this video it is now the bt 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.939
 062 of course it can be a little later 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.350
 video comes later that's already one 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.540
 newer version is so we load so 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.670
 the good witch down there is to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.710
 For example, a ftp client has the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 presidency not 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.920
 I watch me all now my 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.509
 friends in the know that I am 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.579
 that is the download but here have 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.450
 I mean my putics I can 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.570
 Of course, everywhere else too 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.969
 decided but I leave that now 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.829
 half me just my taskbar on so 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.619
 that I can access once and 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.239
 start in the program but first 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.129
 we will be such a security warning 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.230
 I get the tick off here 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.530
 that I keep showing me 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 get and we click on execute 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.459
 so now we have our poti window 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.920
 is easily forgiven this 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.400
 hostname simply the ip-address 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.340
 or just the hostname 1 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 in my example it is now ppc 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.090
 Vereins is a local server therefore 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.629
 I'm back to grab us, of course 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.640
 it's the standard board is 22 that 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.560
 suits my case , it was with you 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.370
 other word would be there of course 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.010
 others ahead 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.080
 I can feel that attitude too 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.220
 For example, the name can be saved 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.840
 just enter now 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.010
 For example, click testserver says and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.019
 whenever I go then but now 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 on it clique he connects me with 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.540
 this server the first time with a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.989
 server connects I get such a 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.720
 security warning because we have to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.690
 Check if the rsa key frick 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.260
 fingerprint is also really in tune 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 In my case, that's right, I 'll say yes 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.390
 he is written in the registry and 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.159
 that will be noticed immediately 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.159
 believe me now on my server 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 foto is now stewing a little moment 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.370
 and we see I am logged in 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.630
 I log in for example bread 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.630
 without any problems 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.110
 we see that works I can 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.290
 Doing everything can make mistakes and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.970
 cake directory am and everything 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.379
 everything works around the meetings 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.360
 to finish properly 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.920
 We will give extra if we have this 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.280
 above the x-fold we would the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.629
 meeting not friendly ended 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.010

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.109
