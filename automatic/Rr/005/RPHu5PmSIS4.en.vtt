00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello my name is andrew and work 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.810
 in company 1 we repair trucks 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.410
 seven days a week in the city of Vladivostok 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.940
 so the most common question diesel stalled 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.920
 on the move froze what do the simplest 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.840
 tips on what we need to do with you 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.850
 warm up the diesel but I assume that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.180
 she herself frozen diesel means us 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.210
 need with you on these you there torch and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.730
 warm fuel tank fuel wire 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 if he is metal of course if he 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.380
 rubber how you need to do very much 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 it's neat so as not to burn anything 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.280
 fuel tubes that go in pairs to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 fuel pump and directly fuel pump itself 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 so your diesel is frozen on the move 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.250
 you are some kind of improvised means 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 tried warmed up the diesel in the tank 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 went through the pipeline but so machine 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 does not start turns to idle what you need 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 first look to check but 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.510
 First of all, we need you to go with you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.780
 find and reticulum which is in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 socks swap on the pump is there next to the pump 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 and clean the antenna 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 if the mesh is fine and the engine 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 continue operations do not start then 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.509
 we need to unscrew you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 spray nozzles from the nozzles and scroll 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.320
 sort of a starter until with 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 diesel fuel tubing will not go as we 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 distinct we will see then it will be necessary 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 screw back and start the engine 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.689
 it will be good if you use 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 ether and if you alleviate this launch 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.560
 you have at hand was not possible ether 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.450
 use the old antiquated method 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.950
 torch that is, we take with you or 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 gas burner if you have or 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.759
 just create from improvised means 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.149
 torch remove the air filter and there 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.070
 when winding near the filter then 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.409
 it turns out on the engine itself takes 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.680
 hot air which makes launching easier 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.680
 motor 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 so by example 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.200
 motor 12 th we have here beside you 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.510
 pump on his example will show where the mesh 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.650
 can be placed as an option and but also 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.200
 how to search 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.740
 it means that there is a pump on the side of the pump 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.450
 swap show you proofreads well here 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.400
 this pumping pump is also called 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.150
 soldier commoners and behold 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.990
 suitable tube to him here she is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.500
 here is just how we her 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.450
 unscrew when we turn off there inside 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.800
 There will be a mesh, it can be plastic 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.390
 it is our task to get it 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.670
 and clean 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.520
 if there is any paraffin or dirt there 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 there have been cases when you and I have 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.730
 here from incoming and this is our return 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.920
 there is a ball socket here 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 the so -called return valve 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.190
 keeps pressure in the fuel pump and when under it 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 garbage falls accordingly 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.860
 fuel pressure is not maintained and fuel 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.510
 on the go themselves and the engine is gloh that is 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.910
 the same paraffin can get here 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.680
 of cancel valve so its you right there 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 warms up if we have something with you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.190
 also happened in the booster pump 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.400
 there we have valves themselves but 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.680
 plastic mostly never under them 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.050
 paraffin or dirt gets into our 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.720
 case of paraffin frozen fuel he 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.970
 can also dump diesel in the tank and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.280
 our own engines and can not make 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.650
 that is exactly the same when we for example 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.540
 themselves already warmed up the car and try 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.000
 start it does not start it means something 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 that the diesel we have ourselves blown for 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 it needs help pump 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.120
 need to unscrew the tube from the injectors need 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.250
 unscrew the hands of the injectors and wait 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.250
 while the snow will splash diesel fuel
