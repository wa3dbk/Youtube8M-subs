thrown so you can slide back and forth

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
thrown so you can slide back and forth
because<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.539> important<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.620> got

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

because that's important because you got
to<00:00:59.160> find<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.000> spot<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to find that just right spot to be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
to find that just right spot to be
comfortable<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.010> drumming<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
comfortable when you're drumming and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
comfortable when you're drumming and
it's<00:01:02.760> never<00:01:02.969> exactly<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> same<00:01:03.809> spot<00:01:04.080> every

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it's never exactly the same spot every

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's never exactly the same spot every
day<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> instead<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> marking<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> let

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
day so instead of marking it you let

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
day so instead of marking it you let
this<00:01:07.820> character<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.030> behind<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> drums<00:01:09.600> make

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this character get behind the drums make

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.000 
this character get behind the drums make

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
sure that he's comfortable and then you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140 
sure that he's comfortable and then you
gap<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> glue<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
gap it down and then I glue it to the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
gap it down and then I glue it to the
drum<00:01:15.150> riser<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.170> drum<00:01:16.439> stage<00:01:16.770> whatever

mean<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> important<00:01:23.580> about

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
mean which is kind of important about

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
mean which is kind of important about
this<00:01:23.939> when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.479> sideways<00:01:24.990> pieces

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this when you get these sideways pieces

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.280 
this when you get these sideways pieces
down<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> keep<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.080> mind

leaving these pieces out loose where

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.800 
leaving these pieces out loose where
they<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> create<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:36.060> dumping<00:01:36.540> hook<00:01:36.689> the

ball of glue under his feet then you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
ball of glue under his feet then you
make<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> platform<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> heel<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.400> work<00:01:41.579> off

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
make a platform for the heel of work off

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
minutes it's not very expensive is it I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.760 
minutes it's not very expensive is it I
don't<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.460> don't<00:01:59.790> think<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.170> not<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
don't know I don't think so not for I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
don't know I don't think so not for I
don't<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.490> divide<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.790> by<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
don't think so if you divide that by the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.429 
don't think so if you divide that by the
twenty<00:02:03.450> five<00:02:03.600> thousand<00:02:04.020> people<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.290> are

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
twenty five thousand people that are

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.380 
twenty five thousand people that are
watching<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.950> you're<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.790> paying<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
watching you you're not paying really a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.560 
watching you you're not paying really a
whole<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.600> per<00:02:06.960> head

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
are essentially two symbols that are

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.590 
are essentially two symbols that are
glued<00:02:46.150> together<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:52.060> actually<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> use

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
glued together you actually have to use

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.270 
glued together you actually have to use
some<00:02:52.870> muscle<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.320> get<00:02:53.470> them<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.680> open<00:02:53.980> up<00:02:54.100> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
some muscle to get them to open up and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
some muscle to get them to open up and
actually<00:02:54.490> move<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.270> looks<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.570> you're

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
actually move so it looks like you're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.570 
actually move so it looks like you're
really<00:02:55.870> yes<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.950> whack<00:02:57.160> them<00:02:57.370> pretty

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
really yes we have to whack them pretty

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.070 
really yes we have to whack them pretty
hard<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.150> why<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.540> extra<00:02:58.810> sticks

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
hard which is why we have extra sticks

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.290 
hard which is why we have extra sticks
so<00:02:59.260> if<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.500> breaks<00:02:59.709> yeah<00:03:00.580> we<00:03:00.940> always<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.270> a
