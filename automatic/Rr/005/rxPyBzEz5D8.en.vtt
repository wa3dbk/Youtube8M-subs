00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in my unflavored gelatin and I'm also

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.489 
in my unflavored gelatin and I'm also
going<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.560> pour<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:58.069> my<00:01:58.369> boiling<00:01:58.999> water<00:01:59.499> slowly

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
going to pour in my boiling water slowly

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.679 
going to pour in my boiling water slowly
add<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:01.039> in<00:02:01.249> and<00:02:01.549> then<00:02:02.090> I'm<00:02:02.179> going<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.479> be

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
add that in and then I'm going to be

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.770 
add that in and then I'm going to be
stirring<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.030> until<00:02:05.030> all<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.329> gelatin

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
stirring up this until all the gelatin

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.060 
stirring up this until all the gelatin
has<00:02:06.170> dissolved<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.140> transferred<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.830> jello

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
has dissolved so I transferred the jello

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.690 
has dissolved so I transferred the jello
mixture<00:02:10.580> into<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:11.540> cup<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> spout<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.430> for

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
mixture into a cup with a spout just for

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.020 
mixture into a cup with a spout just for
ease<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:13.970> pouring

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
ease of pouring

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.360 
ease of pouring
so<00:02:15.210> I've<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.600> my<00:02:15.750> watermelon<00:02:16.410> rind<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
I'm just going to carefully pour this in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.560 
I'm just going to carefully pour this in
and<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.610> fill<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and I'm going to fill it right up to the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.350 
and I'm going to fill it right up to the
top<00:02:21.870> once<00:02:22.680> I've<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> filled<00:02:23.460> I'm<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:24.090> to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
top once I've got it filled I'm going to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.330 
top once I've got it filled I'm going to
put<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> into<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> fridge<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> I'm<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.280> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
put it into the fridge and I'm going to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.120 
put it into the fridge and I'm going to
let<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.520> sit<00:02:26.820> for<00:02:26.850> about<00:02:27.120> four<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.480> six<00:02:27.660> hours

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
let it sit for about four to six hours

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.680 
let it sit for about four to six hours
it's<00:02:29.130> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> readjust<00:02:29.580> at<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.180> point<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it's going to readjust at this point and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's going to readjust at this point and
even<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.680> over<00:02:32.130> or<00:02:32.370> even<00:02:32.760> overnight<00:02:33.060> would<00:02:33.450> be

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
even at over or even overnight would be

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.400 
even at over or even overnight would be
best<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.990> well

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
best as well

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.560 
best as well
it<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.800> gets<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> jello<00:02:35.400> extra<00:02:35.940> solid<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
it just gets the jello extra solid and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.390 
it just gets the jello extra solid and
that's<00:02:36.990> why<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.320> have<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.620> extra<00:02:37.920> gelatin

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that's why we have that extra gelatin

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
that's why we have that extra gelatin
it's<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.850> going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> make<00:02:39.209> sure<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
it's just going to make sure that the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.260 
it's just going to make sure that the
watermelon<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.980> nice<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.640> hard<00:02:41.850> when<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> go

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
to cut it so I tried this next step but

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.540 
to cut it so I tried this next step but
two<00:02:45.360> different<00:02:45.810> ways<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.770> try<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.100> putting
