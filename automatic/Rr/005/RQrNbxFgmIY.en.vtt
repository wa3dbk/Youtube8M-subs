 tv powered by baden tv 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.420
 The captain is at our house 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 saturday is waiting with the away appearance 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 when fc Kaiserslautern southwest derby on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.529
 with what expectations father 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.600
 Yes, I think we expect from us 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.859
 yourself and the fans are allowed to do that too 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.199
 We expect that in Kaiserslautern 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 just in the gate like a completely different one 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.920
 face show than the last two 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 play 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 we have the we have the two 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.190
 Defeats analyzes the mistakes 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 clarified what you can not do anymore 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 which needs to get even better and me 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 think that we are strengthened in that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 The coach could drive in lobby 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 The press conference said that it was a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.559
 the strongest teams what the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.160
 card occupation concerns in the second 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.140
 Bundesliga 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.739
 To what extent does it matter for you? 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.270
 who on the other hand stands in the square 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 the past has shown that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.910
 we better against against playful 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 Strong teams can act as 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.799
 the crews are behind 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 put in place and wall 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.930
 We have already shown this year 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.790
 that this error or this one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 can play and also play 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.770
 to play such teams but me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 derby character that speaks for 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.729
 It's not about that at first 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.310
 playful line i believe that will be 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.479
 try to eat and and there 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.049
 we need to fight against it only once 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.210
 hold 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 with which personal memories 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.900
 you firmly in the 2 2 in the hinspiel 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.210
 ended so both play behind 22 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.150
 chairman what you the tower in the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.540
 battle at the end so I hope that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.850
 So first the past games 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
 they do not care anymore and me 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.399
 Hope we need less luck 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 and to want to cycle again than as 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.110
 Last year, but I'm good things 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.270
 that we are strengthened and in 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.970
 in the old form again reach out to the citizens 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.050
 you can now have an away game 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 brought in you 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.910
 There were in principle zero windowsill there 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.920
 There was no support inevitably 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.140
 because in leipzig a fans took part 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.790
 are now on the morrow 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.460
 betzenberg for streets karlsruher like 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.290
 important for you yes I have it 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.960
 one in the apron already said that the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.970
 support from the fans abroad 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.940
 excellent no matter where that goes and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.130
 Tomorrow will be your last year too 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.100
 get to know really steamed 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.670
 can and that's because the 35 or 40 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.480
 a thousand kaiserslautern maybe 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 in the meantime vote a bit 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.580
 can and as I said we hope that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.040
 So I think the atmosphere is great 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.840
 the fans will give 90 minutes of gas and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.660
 that will be transmitted in the square 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.310
 and that's what the boys are supposed to do 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.590
 should that record with that and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.660
 Tomorrow, all house small what he what she 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.520
 then have the game-free week so 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.570
 tomorrow we will not need any consideration 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.470
 to take any losses 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:03.070
