months ago

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.180 
months ago
the<00:00:52.930> first<00:00:53.170> time<00:00:53.320> he<00:00:53.410> came<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.650> this<00:00:53.769> Beach<00:00:53.949> I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the first time he came to this Beach I

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.400 
the first time he came to this Beach I
mean<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.519> literally<00:00:54.910> waist-deep<00:00:55.809> back

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
mean it was literally waist-deep back

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.470 
mean it was literally waist-deep back
here<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.280> mean<00:00:57.550> it's<00:00:57.699> pretty<00:00:57.730> obvious<00:00:57.910> from

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
here so I mean it's pretty obvious from

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.119 
here so I mean it's pretty obvious from
this<00:00:58.660> giant<00:00:58.839> trash<00:00:59.199> pile<00:00:59.440> here<00:00:59.650> that<00:00:59.830> plastic

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
this giant trash pile here that plastic

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.820 
this giant trash pile here that plastic
bottles<00:01:00.460> are<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.640> huge<00:01:00.850> issue<00:01:00.879> because<00:01:01.839> they're

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
bottles are a huge issue because they're

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.710 
bottles are a huge issue because they're
disposable<00:01:03.190> right<00:01:03.699> people<00:01:03.970> buy<00:01:04.120> them<00:01:04.390> they

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
disposable right people buy them they

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.940 
disposable right people buy them they
drink<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.049> water<00:01:05.260> from<00:01:05.440> them<00:01:05.560> or<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.799> some

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
drink the water from them or in some

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.859 
drink the water from them or in some
cases<00:01:06.159> they<00:01:06.430> don't<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.000> then<00:01:07.570> they<00:01:07.690> throw

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
cases they don't and then they throw

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.539 
cases they don't and then they throw
them<00:01:08.020> away<00:01:08.080> but<00:01:08.950> they<00:01:09.040> don't<00:01:09.190> go<00:01:09.280> away

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
them away but they don't go away

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.390 
them away but they don't go away
they<00:01:10.360> end<00:01:10.479> up<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.690> landfills<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.290> oceans<00:01:12.130> and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
they end up in landfills and oceans and

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.980 
they end up in landfills and oceans and
beaches<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:13.119> mean<00:01:13.270> there's<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.630> hundreds
