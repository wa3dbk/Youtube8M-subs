the gold tips I didn't do the wings and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.440 
the gold tips I didn't do the wings and
the<00:03:18.360> reason<00:03:18.690> why<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.269> a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the reason why it is it's just that's a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.430 
the reason why it is it's just that's a
lot<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.630> work<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.050> more<00:03:22.140> detail<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:25.200> looks

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
lot of work in more detail so it looks

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.250 
lot of work in more detail so it looks
better<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.920> anyways

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
