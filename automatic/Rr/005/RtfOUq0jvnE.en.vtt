00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.680
 filmed for you to do that very much 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.620
 people that used to be so there is a hocker 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.630
 Mom's family not out 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 and with a bit of a busy or 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.449
 routine that everyone has a year 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.980
 in honors something special but like 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.920
 just like a lot of people the after asked 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 so i thought i'm going to chon for you 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.939
 I have a kind of small solution 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 sought the lightness for my eye 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 problem i only have one here 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 little about the lightness but i will 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500
 show what it's like when i get it right 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.880
 for the tear film then it looks like this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.200
 and I don't think it's a whole thing in itself 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.730
 bad background but yes i like it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 space 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 maybe I'll go pretty much show 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
 but I'm looking a little horn 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.930
