00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
I mean I found machines here that I've

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.090 
I mean I found machines here that I've
never<00:01:58.600> seen<00:01:58.899> before<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.350> work<00:01:59.679> all<00:01:59.890> these

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
never seen before that work all these

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.710 
never seen before that work all these
different<00:02:00.399> angles<00:02:00.550> angles<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.539> wouldn't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
different angles angles you wouldn't

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.850 
different angles angles you wouldn't
even<00:02:01.780> think<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:02.200> they<00:02:02.350> take<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> place<00:02:02.830> of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
even think of they take the place of

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.260 
even think of they take the place of
free<00:02:03.160> weights<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.640> free<00:02:03.789> weights<00:02:03.940> are<00:02:04.090> good

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
free weights and free weights are good

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.359 
free weights and free weights are good
but<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.570> machines<00:02:04.840> today<00:02:05.110> do<00:02:06.009> almost<00:02:06.160> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
but the machines today do almost the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.940 
but the machines today do almost the
same<00:02:06.459> thing<00:02:06.610> as<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:08.440> walk<00:02:08.649> through<00:02:08.679> here

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
same thing as we walk through here

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.770 
same thing as we walk through here
you'll<00:02:09.160> see<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.670> goes<00:02:09.789> back<00:02:10.240> into<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
you'll see that it goes back into the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.699 
you'll see that it goes back into the
