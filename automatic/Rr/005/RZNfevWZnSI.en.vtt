right now well the nice part about this

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.610 
right now well the nice part about this
studio<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.570> we've<00:00:37.690> got<00:00:37.899> concrete<00:00:38.320> walls

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
studio is that we've got concrete walls

this system work with the built-in
infrared<00:00:43.600> triggering<00:00:44.230> let<00:00:45.160> me<00:00:45.250> your<00:00:45.340> think<00:00:45.489> it

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
infrared triggering let me your think it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.430 
infrared triggering let me your think it
will<00:00:45.730> why<00:00:46.360> don't<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.840> recommend<00:00:47.380> for

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
will why don't you recommend for

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.530 
will why don't you recommend for
photographers<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.219> do<00:00:48.340> that<00:00:48.579> well<00:00:48.730> hang<00:00:48.880> on<00:00:49.000> if

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
photographers to do that well hang on if

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.930 
photographers to do that well hang on if
this<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:50.050> all<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.829> shoot<00:00:51.280> if<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.489> work<00:00:51.790> in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
this is all the you shoot if you work in

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.819 
this is all the you shoot if you work in
only<00:00:52.210> these<00:00:52.570> type<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.870> environments<00:00:53.530> that

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
only these type of environments that

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.069 
only these type of environments that
system<00:00:54.280> will<00:00:54.370> work<00:00:54.399> very<00:00:54.520> well<00:00:54.850> however<00:00:55.360> the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
system will work very well however the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.900 
system will work very well however the
minute<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.469> take<00:00:56.680> those<00:00:56.860> two<00:00:57.070> flashes<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.640> just

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
minute we take those two flashes I just

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.000 
minute we take those two flashes I just
showed<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.420> walk<00:00:59.170> right<00:00:59.620> out<00:00:59.770> that<00:00:59.800> door

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
showed you and walk right out that door

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.930 
showed you and walk right out that door
outside<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:02.620> find<00:01:02.950> out<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.309> those<00:01:03.399> flashes

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
outside will find out that those flashes

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.279 
outside will find out that those flashes
will<00:01:04.089> no<00:01:04.269> longer<00:01:04.299> work<00:01:04.659> in<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.019> predictable

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
will no longer work in a predictable

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.880 
will no longer work in a predictable
manner<00:01:05.590> it's<00:01:06.280> true<00:01:06.479> why<00:01:07.479> well<00:01:08.380> they<00:01:08.740> use

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
manner it's true why well they use

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.580 
manner it's true why well they use
infrared<00:01:09.580> which<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.450> light<00:01:10.869> they<00:01:11.170> use<00:01:11.290> little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
infrared which is light they use little

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.440 
infrared which is light they use little
pulses<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.220> light<00:01:12.400> it's<00:01:12.670> very<00:01:12.850> hard<00:01:13.119> for<00:01:13.180> us<00:01:13.420> to

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
pulses of light it's very hard for us to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.260 
pulses of light it's very hard for us to
see<00:01:13.869> however<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.740> Sun<00:01:15.040> does<00:01:15.310> spit<00:01:15.760> out<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.970> lot

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
see however the Sun does spit out a lot

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.109 
see however the Sun does spit out a lot
of<00:01:16.390> infrared<00:01:16.690> light<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.560> blinds<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
of infrared light and it blinds the

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.120 
of infrared light and it blinds the
system<00:01:19.540> what<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.409> think<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.680> how<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.070> be

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130

well that causes us some problems the
problem<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.210> if<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.200> one<00:01:44.530> flash<00:01:44.860> on<00:01:45.159> the

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
problem is if we have one flash on the

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.310 
problem is if we have one flash on the
camera<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:46.000> then<00:01:46.420> we<00:01:46.540> have<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.840> second

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
camera and then we have that second

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.380 
camera and then we have that second
flash<00:01:47.530> behind<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.310> camera<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:48.850> maybe<00:01:49.299> a

working<00:01:51.400> outside<00:01:52.060> it's<00:01:52.990> really<00:01:53.320> hard<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
working outside it's really hard for the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.219 
working outside it's really hard for the
flash<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.299> spit<00:01:55.659> out<00:01:55.689> an<00:01:55.930> infrared

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
flash here to spit out an infrared

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.679 
flash here to spit out an infrared
signal<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:57.579> goes<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.880> an<00:01:57.970> open<00:01:58.180> field<00:01:58.450> and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
signal that goes to an open field and

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.200 
signal that goes to an open field and
have<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.439> flash<00:01:59.680> behind<00:02:00.070> me<00:02:00.220> see<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.549> what<00:02:01.119> we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
have that flash behind me see it what we

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.700 
have that flash behind me see it what we
have<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.450> do<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.600> we<00:02:01.840> have<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.049> convert<00:02:02.530> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
have to do is we have to convert that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.039 
have to do is we have to convert that
into<00:02:02.920> radio<00:02:03.579> waves<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.450> instead<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.810> using

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
into radio waves so instead of using

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.899 
into radio waves so instead of using
little<00:02:05.350> bursts<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.770> light<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.399> communicate

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
little bursts of light to communicate

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.240 
little bursts of light to communicate
between<00:02:07.060> those<00:02:07.390> flashes<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:08.049> prefer<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.739> use

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
between those flashes I prefer to use

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.449 
between those flashes I prefer to use
radio<00:02:09.819> waves<00:02:09.879> well<00:02:10.810> we'll<00:02:11.379> why<00:02:12.159> don't<00:02:12.370> you

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
radio waves well we'll why don't you

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.250 
radio waves well we'll why don't you
just<00:02:12.700> get<00:02:12.909> one<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.450> infrared

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just get one of the infrared

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.040 
just get one of the infrared
transmitters<00:02:15.129> well<00:02:15.639> hang<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.359> I<00:02:16.629> got

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
transmitters well hang on I got

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.670 
transmitters well hang on I got
to<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> night<00:02:18.880> conversion<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.500> has

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to this is the night conversion it has

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.590 
to this is the night conversion it has
an<00:02:20.890> infrared<00:02:21.160> system<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.450> more

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
an infrared system on it that is more

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.200 
an infrared system on it that is more
powerful<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.230> little<00:02:23.590> more<00:02:23.710> omnidirectional

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
powerful a little more omnidirectional

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.120 
powerful a little more omnidirectional
than<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.630> built-in<00:02:26.230> ones<00:02:26.470> into<00:02:26.770> your<00:02:26.860> flash

and does this do a better job yes it
does<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:30.730> something<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.240> we<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.600> use

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
does is it something that we can use

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.080 
does is it something that we can use
