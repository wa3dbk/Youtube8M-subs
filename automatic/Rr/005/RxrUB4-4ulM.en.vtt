00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:23.090
 poster on the screen well, in general it 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.070
 the only actress who is worthy 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.520
 played in this movie but which 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.500
 interesting in general opera film 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 jennifer aniston and still cute al 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.239
 fisher and interesting finken what is it 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.069
 detroit late 70s 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.800
 what can I tell you about garlic now 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:46.159
 about this movie 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.139
 I can say that it is clear actually 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.999
 saying that we watched for Jean 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:53.780
 counted on a comedy in the style of the story 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.989
 skin barrel 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.209
 about henry weaving light comedy funny action 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.179
 my key and with we come to the cinema we sit down there 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:04.339
 There is such a serious enough thriller 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.399
 with a detective in the beginning nothing at all 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.710
 funny started there is no we have half an hour 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.320
 they could understand what kind of genre you can see 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.079
 stylish people are dressed perfect 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.759
 reproductions of the seventies and what 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.740
 ass and could not understand but then 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.289
 it turned out that this is still a comedy but 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.859
 such a comedy is not dynamic so light 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.380
 vital life so romantic 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.390
 really funny moments were that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.710
 I can say humor about this movie 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.079
 present but not very much 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.359
 the dynamics of the film a little bit him i can't 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.710
 say that was very boring can not 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.740
 to say that the film is boring 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.679
 but he is not super dynamic to watch 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.140
 once you can definitely I would put 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:55.609
 this film is not a solid not liquid such 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.280
 four can be without minus but 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.210
 still with easy on heavy fours 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.380
 with a stretch in general who like 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.069
 Jennifer Aniston 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.999
 who likes this is ilay phisher 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.150
 you can see 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.400
 cute two actresses 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.400
 I didn't like the movie because 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.680
 absolutely incomprehensible was the 1 floor of the film 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.709
 what will happen next because then I can be 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.099
 anything we waited for as possible and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.079
 blood is so possible and comedy but if 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.510
 honestly I did not believe the first half hour 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.000
 frequency will be komi I already started thinking 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.849
 what is this serious thriller that jennifer 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 aniston may be injured kill be tortured 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.689
 but I will not tell you what will happen next 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 pluses movies told humor is and 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:48.859
 the director managed to intrigue strongly 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.299
 you canâ€™t call boring cons too 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.260
 that the film cannot be said to be 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.470
 so straight cool cool dynamic that 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.540
 after it you leave and itâ€™s really cool 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.459
 after it comes out well, but interesting 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.930
 say what a masterpiece is not straight 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.450
 say so if you like my 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.480
 or another forgive already agreeing already 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.329
