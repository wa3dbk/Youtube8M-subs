going to be a piece of cast iron that
isn't<00:01:42.490> analyzed<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.750> protected<00:01:44.259> from

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
isn't analyzed so it is protected from

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.649 
isn't analyzed so it is protected from
rusting<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.610> what<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.850> gives<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.209> is<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.390> nice

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
rusting but what it gives you is a nice

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.749 
rusting but what it gives you is a nice
flat<00:01:47.080> surface<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:47.890> now<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.220> barbecue<00:01:48.640> grill

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
flat surface so now the barbecue grill

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.279 
flat surface so now the barbecue grill
isn't<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:49.270> something<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.869> use<00:01:50.080> for

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
isn't just something that you use for

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.719 
isn't just something that you use for
hamburgers<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.920> hot<00:01:51.039> dogs<00:01:51.069> this<00:01:51.580> is

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
hamburgers and hot dogs this is

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.430 
hamburgers and hot dogs this is
something<00:01:51.970> we<00:01:52.030> could<00:01:52.179> do<00:01:52.270> pancakes<00:01:52.780> bacon<00:01:53.080> and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
something we could do pancakes bacon and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.580 
something we could do pancakes bacon and
eggs<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.950> morning<00:01:54.100> too<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.880> very

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
eggs in the morning too so very

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.880 
eggs in the morning too so very
versatile<00:01:56.590> product<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:59.259> also<00:01:59.590> if<00:01:59.740> you're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
versatile product and also if you're

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.760 
versatile product and also if you're
going<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.069> do<00:02:00.929> hamburgers<00:02:01.929> or<00:02:02.140> steaks<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.590> can

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
going to do hamburgers or steaks we can

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.260 
going to do hamburgers or steaks we can
definitely<00:02:02.950> sauté<00:02:03.580> up<00:02:03.700> some<00:02:03.729> onions

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
definitely sauté up some onions

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.359 
definitely sauté up some onions
mushrooms<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:05.080> stuff<00:02:05.229> like<00:02:05.349> that<00:02:05.590> right<00:02:06.159> here

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
mushrooms and stuff like that right here

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.830 
mushrooms and stuff like that right here
on<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.610> barbecue<00:02:06.970> grill<00:02:07.000> without<00:02:07.479> having<00:02:07.750> to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
on the barbecue grill without having to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.330 
on the barbecue grill without having to
go<00:02:07.959> into<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.229> kitchen<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.739> we<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.130> put<00:02:09.280> them

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
go into the kitchen and we can put them

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.460 
go into the kitchen and we can put them
right<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.519> top<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.849> our<00:02:10.060> steaks<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:11.140> burger

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
right on top of our steaks and a burger

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.400 
right on top of our steaks and a burger
so<00:02:11.709> that's<00:02:12.280> only<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.640> very<00:02:12.850> useful<00:02:13.480> tool<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so that's only a very useful tool in the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.680 
so that's only a very useful tool in the
barbecue<00:02:14.680> grill<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.180> inside<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.570> the

barbecue grill on the inside of the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.960 
barbecue grill on the inside of the
barbecue<00:02:17.079> we're<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.859> have<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.760> burner

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
barbecue we're going to have the burner

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.990 
barbecue we're going to have the burner
system

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
system

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.520 
system
something<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.300> see<00:02:22.480> very<00:02:23.110> unique<00:02:23.410> about

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
something you can see very unique about

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.950 
something you can see very unique about
the<00:02:23.770> start<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> grow<00:02:24.400> my<00:02:24.670> 10<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.600> life<00:02:25.780> on

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
the start if you grow my 10 to life on

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.930 
the start if you grow my 10 to life on
is<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.500> fact<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.860> they're<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> straight

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
is the fact that they're a straight

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.330 
is the fact that they're a straight
burner<00:02:28.180> system<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.810> constructed<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.740> 304

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
burner system is constructed of 304

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.000 
burner system is constructed of 304
stainless<00:02:30.430> steel<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.380> notice<00:02:32.800> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
stainless steel the if you notice the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.800 
stainless steel the if you notice the
port<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.850> holes<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> burner<00:02:34.570> system

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
port of the holes for the burner system

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.740 
port of the holes for the burner system
are<00:02:35.080> actually<00:02:35.170> covered<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:37.090> allowing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
are actually covered and not allowing

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.930 
are actually covered and not allowing
grease<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:38.680> anything<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.100> drip<00:02:39.340> into<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.640> hole

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
grease or anything to drip into the hole

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.910 
grease or anything to drip into the hole
so<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> key<00:02:40.960> factor<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> barbecue

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
so this is a key factor on the barbecue

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.010 
so this is a key factor on the barbecue
grill<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.340> lot<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.880> grills<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.510> see<00:02:43.720> that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
grill a lot of grills that you see that

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.050 
grill a lot of grills that you see that
you're<00:02:44.170> typically<00:02:44.500> replacing<00:02:45.190> parts<00:02:45.520> on<00:02:45.640> are

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
you're typically replacing parts on are

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.760 
you're typically replacing parts on are
usually<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.690> u-shape<00:02:47.320> or<00:02:47.530> an<00:02:47.620> 8

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
usually going to be a u-shape or an 8

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.770 
usually going to be a u-shape or an 8
shape<00:02:48.040> burner<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.360> definitely<00:02:49.690> going

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
shape burner so this is definitely going

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.960 
shape burner so this is definitely going
to<00:02:49.840> hold<00:02:50.050> up<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.410> long<00:02:50.590> time<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.730> more

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
to hold up for a long time one more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.090 
to hold up for a long time one more
sturdier<00:02:52.360> burner<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.840> excited<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.890> lot<00:02:54.070> of

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
sturdier burner so excited and a lot of

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.490 
sturdier burner so excited and a lot of
hard<00:02:54.340> eating<00:02:54.580> goes<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:54.940> stuff<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.350> know

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
hard eating goes up stuff and you know

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.890 
hard eating goes up stuff and you know
it's<00:02:56.680> pretty<00:02:57.550> easy<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.090> put<00:02:58.209> back<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> forth

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it's pretty easy to put back and forth

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.020 
it's pretty easy to put back and forth
into<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.230> barbecue<00:02:59.620> grill<00:02:59.760> right<00:03:00.760> above<00:03:00.970> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
into the barbecue grill right above that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.920 
into the barbecue grill right above that
is<00:03:01.540> what<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:01.989> call<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:03.000> anti<00:03:04.000> flare<00:03:04.300> system<00:03:04.570> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
is what we call a anti flare system is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
is what we call a anti flare system is
basically<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.860> allow<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.550> drippings

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
basically going to allow the drippings

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.570 
basically going to allow the drippings
of<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.510> food<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.320> drip<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.800> this<00:03:08.950> area<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
reduce flare-ups as well as make

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.620 
reduce flare-ups as well as make
cleaning<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.670> easy<00:03:24.850> because<00:03:25.120> that's<00:03:25.420> also

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
cleaning really easy because that's also

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.320 
cleaning really easy because that's also
dishwasher<00:03:25.959> safe<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.830> then<00:03:27.670> lastly<00:03:28.060> we're

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
dishwasher safe and then lastly we're

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.979 
dishwasher safe and then lastly we're
looking<00:03:28.630> at<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.790> cooking<00:03:31.120> grids<00:03:31.330> themselves

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
looking at the cooking grids themselves

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.059 
looking at the cooking grids themselves
the<00:03:32.709> cooking

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.940 

again<00:03:37.069> it's<00:03:37.280> cast-iron<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:38.510> lot<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.560> girls<00:03:39.830> that

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
again it's cast-iron a lot of girls that

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.289 
again it's cast-iron a lot of girls that
you<00:03:40.099> see<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.459> industry<00:03:40.879> today<00:03:40.970> are

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
you see in the industry today are

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.509 
you see in the industry today are
typically<00:03:41.720> stainless<00:03:42.200> steel<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.739> that's

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
typically stainless steel and that's

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.930 
typically stainless steel and that's
really<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.000> consumerism<00:03:44.890> cast<00:03:45.890> iron<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.640> a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
really just consumerism cast iron is a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.880 
really just consumerism cast iron is a
product<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.690> typically<00:03:48.290> see<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.709> lot<00:03:48.860> of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
product that I typically see in a lot of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.990 
product that I typically see in a lot of
nice<00:03:49.220> chopped<00:03:49.670> houses<00:03:50.150> my<00:03:50.470> high-end

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
nice chopped houses my high-end

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.559 
nice chopped houses my high-end
restaurants<00:03:53.000> are<00:03:53.090> going<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.299> use<00:03:53.420> this

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
restaurants are going to use this

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.360 
restaurants are going to use this
because<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.049> cast<00:03:54.290> iron<00:03:54.530> absorbs<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.190> heat

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
because the cast iron absorbs the heat

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.550 
because the cast iron absorbs the heat
and<00:03:55.580> really<00:03:56.239> puts<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.660> heat<00:03:56.870> back<00:03:56.900> into<00:03:57.470> your

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
and really puts that heat back into your

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.110 
and really puts that heat back into your
food<00:03:57.860> giving<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.310> great<00:03:58.580> grill<00:03:58.819> marks

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
food giving you great grill marks

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.530 
food giving you great grill marks
something<00:03:59.930> unique<00:04:00.319> about<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.459> lot<00:04:02.420> of

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
something unique about this is a lot of

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.530 
something unique about this is a lot of
cast<00:04:02.780> iron<00:04:03.019> grills<00:04:03.549> are<00:04:04.549> typically<00:04:05.060> just<00:04:05.269> raw

cast iron where we use what they call a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.229 
cast iron where we use what they call a
RF<00:04:09.079> which<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.470> rust<00:04:09.680> free<00:04:09.950> technology<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.879> it

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
RF which is rust free technology and it

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.869 
RF which is rust free technology and it
is<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.440> little<00:04:12.440> bit<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.799> satin<00:04:13.250> finish<00:04:13.519> here

that fills the pores of the cast iron it

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.379 
that fills the pores of the cast iron it
also<00:04:16.070> protects<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.699> from<00:04:16.729> any<00:04:17.000> moisture

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
also protects it from any moisture

the<00:04:25.280> ignition<00:04:25.610> system<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:26.750> typically

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
the ignition system this is typically

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.570 
the ignition system this is typically
the<00:04:27.229> number<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.680> replaced<00:04:28.039> part<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.430> most

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the number on replaced part in most

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580 
the number on replaced part in most
barbecue<00:04:29.090> grills<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:30.380> they're

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
barbecue grills is because they're

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.950 
barbecue grills is because they're
typically<00:04:31.010> going<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.280> be<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.510> battery<00:04:32.510> operated

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
typically going to be a battery operated

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.900 
typically going to be a battery operated
system<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.650> any<00:04:33.889> type<00:04:34.100> of<00:04:34.130> battery<00:04:34.580> system

system and any type of battery system
outside<00:04:35.060> with<00:04:35.510> moisture<00:04:35.960> always<00:04:36.650> going<00:04:36.830> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
outside with moisture always going to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.560 
outside with moisture always going to
get<00:04:37.039> corrosion<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.820> batteries<00:04:38.210> erupted

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
get corrosion in the batteries erupted

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.909 
get corrosion in the batteries erupted
and<00:04:38.720> I'm<00:04:38.840> sure<00:04:39.080> most<00:04:39.260> people<00:04:39.380> have<00:04:39.650> seen<00:04:39.889> that

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
and I'm sure most people have seen that

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.879 
and I'm sure most people have seen that
but<00:04:40.610> these<00:04:40.789> guys<00:04:41.060> use<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> titanium<00:04:42.260> coated

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
but these guys use is a titanium coated

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.680 
but these guys use is a titanium coated
quartz<00:04:43.310> ignition<00:04:43.729> system<00:04:44.120> which<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.360> battery

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
quartz ignition system which is battery

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.900 
quartz ignition system which is battery
free<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.680> there's<00:04:45.860> no<00:04:45.919> replacement<00:04:46.340> parts<00:04:46.820> to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
free so there's no replacement parts to

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.110 
free so there's no replacement parts to
it<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:48.470> basically<00:04:48.650> just<00:04:49.039> turn<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.520> click

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
it and you basically just turn and click

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.290 
it and you basically just turn and click
the<00:04:50.360> spark<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.900> ignites<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.590> burner<00:04:51.800> system

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
the spark is ignites the burner system

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.120 
the spark is ignites the burner system
then<00:04:53.300> we<00:04:53.450> have<00:04:53.479> fire<00:04:54.400> very<00:04:55.400> simple<00:04:55.820> system<00:04:56.180> to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
then we have fire very simple system to

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.130 
then we have fire very simple system to
is<00:04:58.130> an<00:04:58.550> inline<00:04:59.000> ignition<00:04:59.540> system<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.080> you

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
is an inline ignition system so you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.020 
is an inline ignition system so you
really<00:05:00.440> only<00:05:00.620> have<00:05:00.710> one<00:05:00.890> igniter<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:01.850> and

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
really only have one igniter on here and

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.270 
really only have one igniter on here and
then<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.660> rest<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.290> burner<00:05:03.620> systems<00:05:04.100> are

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
then the rest of the burner systems are

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.500 
then the rest of the burner systems are
going<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.490> light<00:05:04.970> in<00:05:05.180> concession<00:05:05.810> with<00:05:05.960> that

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
going to light in concession with that

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.820 
going to light in concession with that
you<00:05:08.510> have<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.690> nice<00:05:08.960> warning<00:05:09.260> tray<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
you have a nice warning tray on the

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.230 
you have a nice warning tray on the
inside<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.310> barbecue<00:05:10.640> grill<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:11.030> need<00:05:11.150> to

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
inside of the barbecue grill you need to

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.270 
inside of the barbecue grill you need to
lift<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.570> up<00:05:11.720> here<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.530> for<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.860> most<00:05:12.980> part

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
lift it up here but for the most part

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.360 
lift it up here but for the most part
that's<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.640> entire<00:05:14.770> description<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:16.190> what

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
that's the entire description of what
