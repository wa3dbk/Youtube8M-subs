00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that's what they look like sub there we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
that's what they look like sub there we
go<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.030> sizes<00:00:57.270> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
go and then there's three sizes of

amplifier<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> want<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.380> does<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
amplifier now I want to know does that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429 
amplifier now I want to know does that
mean<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.430> speakers<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.750> thousand

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
mean that these speakers are a thousand

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.770 
mean that these speakers are a thousand
watts<00:01:34.680> RMS<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> can't<00:01:36.299> find<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> either

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
watts RMS that I can't find that either

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
watts RMS that I can't find that either
or<00:01:37.049> does<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.710> mean<00:01:38.009> interests<00:01:38.220> 1000<00:01:38.700> watt

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
or does that mean interests 1000 watt

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.050 
or does that mean interests 1000 watt
amplifier<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.990> limited<00:01:41.060> somebody

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
amplifier and then limited somebody

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
amplifier and then limited somebody
knows<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.659> speakers<00:01:43.110> well<00:01:43.380> I'd

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
knows a bit more about speakers well I'd

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
knows a bit more about speakers well I'd
love<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> video<00:01:44.490> response<00:01:44.729> would<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.210> fantastic

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
love a video response would be fantastic

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.179 
love a video response would be fantastic
if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> video<00:01:46.530> response<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.159> that

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
if you could do a video response on that

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.170 
if you could do a video response on that
one<00:01:47.460> brilliant<00:01:48.649> excited<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.149> are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
one brilliant excited right so there are

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.440 
one brilliant excited right so there are
thousand<00:01:51.570> wants<00:01:51.930> plus<00:01:52.229> T<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.090> parallels<00:01:54.090> good

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
thousand wants plus T and parallels good

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319 
thousand wants plus T and parallels good
now<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> come<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.470> three<00:01:55.710> sizes<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.490> god

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
now that come in three sizes and the god

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
now that come in three sizes and the god
will<00:01:57.540> getting<00:01:57.750> closure<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.590> i<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
will getting closure but i think the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
will getting closure but i think the
tops<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.700> plastic<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.390> i've<00:02:01.380> heard<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> you

also I won't have to limit it as well
the<00:02:45.640> exact<00:02:45.850> now<00:02:46.150> i'll<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.870> reading<00:02:47.110> up<00:02:47.320> on

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the exact now i'll be reading up on

the exact now i'll be reading up on
these<00:02:47.590> guys<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:48.490> might<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.850> limited

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
these guys I think they might be limited

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.750 
these guys I think they might be limited
which<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.230> they<00:02:50.410> are<00:02:50.560> than<00:02:50.770> thousand<00:02:51.550> watts

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
which if they are than thousand watts

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.010 
which if they are than thousand watts
was<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> point<00:02:52.180> having<00:02:52.390> limit<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.870> you

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
was the point having limit on it you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.320 
was the point having limit on it you
know<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.830> they<00:02:54.520> also<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.120> thing

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
know just they also have this thing

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.300 
know just they also have this thing
called<00:02:55.360> deep<00:02:55.810> which<00:02:56.320> they<00:02:56.590> trademarked<00:02:56.890> and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
called deep which they trademarked and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.220 
called deep which they trademarked and
it's<00:02:58.090> supposed<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.540> give<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> low<00:02:58.990> frequency

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
it's supposed to give a low frequency

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's supposed to give a low frequency
response<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> active<00:03:01.270> speaker<00:03:02.010> low

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
response to the active speaker low

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.590 
response to the active speaker low
frequency<00:03:03.580> transmission<00:03:04.210> now<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:05.350> not
