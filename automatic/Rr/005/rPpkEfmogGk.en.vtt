done I've taken the famous 9104 and
taking<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> toe<00:00:18.660> blade<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> 9104<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
taking the toe blade off of the 9104 and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.120 
taking the toe blade off of the 9104 and
I've<00:00:21.779> placed<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.980> s33<00:00:23.970> G<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.390> see

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
I've placed it on the s33 G you can see

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.110 
I've placed it on the s33 G you can see
by<00:00:29.130> looking<00:00:30.740> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> came<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
by looking this is what it came with and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.310 
by looking this is what it came with and
you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.440> much<00:00:34.770> bigger<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:36.480> 9104

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you can see how much bigger the 9104

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.459 
you can see how much bigger the 9104
tail<00:00:37.620> blade<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.760> problem<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.110> pitch

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
tail blade is the problem is the pitch

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
tail blade is the problem is the pitch
of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> blades<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:42.149> angle<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.730> opposite<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
of the blades the angle is opposite so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
of the blades the angle is opposite so
what<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.850> will<00:00:47.850> fit<00:00:48.090> right

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
what you got to do this will fit right

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
what you got to do this will fit right
on<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.110> screw<00:00:49.910> will<00:00:50.910> fit<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> bolt<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
on and the screw will fit and bolt it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.540 
on and the screw will fit and bolt it
right<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.610> down<00:00:53.820> ok<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.320> afterwards<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.370> got

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
right on down ok but afterwards you got

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
right on down ok but afterwards you got
to<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> front<00:00:57.239> canopy<00:00:57.629> off<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.890> I've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to take the front canopy off now I've

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
to take the front canopy off now I've
take<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.850> hidden<00:01:00.059> took<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> liberty<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
take one hidden took the liberty of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.039 
take one hidden took the liberty of
taking<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.010> canopy<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:03.359> seven<00:01:03.840> vote

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
taking the canopy off my seven vote

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.730 
taking the canopy off my seven vote
version<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:05.369> there's<00:01:05.780> 11.4<00:01:06.780> volt<00:01:07.170> version

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
version now there's 11.4 volt version

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
version now there's 11.4 volt version
and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.070> 7.4<00:01:11.990> version<00:01:12.990> now

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and then there's the 7.4 version now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
and then there's the 7.4 version now
this<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.979> has<00:01:14.159> heat<00:01:14.850> sinks<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this one has heat sinks around the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
this one has heat sinks around the
motors<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:17.250> learned<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> motors<00:01:18.210> would

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
motors they learned the motors would

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.310 
motors they learned the motors would
overheat<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:20.220> burn<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:22.049> came

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
overheat and would burn up so they came

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
overheat and would burn up so they came
up<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.890> metal<00:01:23.310> straps<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.119> they<00:01:24.270> put

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
up with these metal straps that they put

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
up with these metal straps that they put
around<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> motor<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> strap<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
around the motor and strap it to the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200 
around the motor and strap it to the
frame<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> air<00:01:29.430> cow<00:01:29.850> on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
frame and then with the air cow on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319 
frame and then with the air cow on
they've<00:01:30.600> cut<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> cow<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> air<00:01:32.939> from

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
they've cut the cow out so the air from

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
they've cut the cow out so the air from
the<00:01:33.390> bottom<00:01:34.229> blades<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.220> wash<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the bottom blades will down wash and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.690 
the bottom blades will down wash and
cool<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> motors<00:01:37.079> these<00:01:37.770> work<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> heat

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
cool the motors these work like a heat

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.080 
cool the motors these work like a heat
sink<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.360> let<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> body<00:01:40.259> absorb<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> make

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
sink and let the body absorb so make

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
sink and let the body absorb so make
sure<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> giver<00:01:42.659> work<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sure you're a giver work on it that you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
sure you're a giver work on it that you
put<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:43.890> heat<00:01:44.189> sinks<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> 11

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
put these heat sinks back on now the 11

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
put these heat sinks back on now the 11
boat<00:01:46.829> doesn't<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.659> recommend

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
boat doesn't have these so I recommend

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
boat doesn't have these so I recommend
buying<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> heatsinks<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> 11

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
buying the heatsinks if you have the 11

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
buying the heatsinks if you have the 11
boat<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.049> putting<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> heat<00:01:52.649> things<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
boat and putting the heat things on but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.139 
boat and putting the heat things on but
anyway<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.490> I've<00:01:56.790> done<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
anyway back to the you see I've done the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.130 
anyway back to the you see I've done the
mod<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:59.450> now<00:02:00.450> what<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.960> got<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
mod to this one also now what you got to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.660 
mod to this one also now what you got to
do<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> PCB<00:02:02.310> board<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.960> take

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
do is on the PCB board you have to take

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.550 
do is on the PCB board you have to take
the<00:02:05.670> tow<00:02:06.030> motor<00:02:06.770> wire<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.300> cut<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.349> then

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the tow motor wire and cut it and then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.630 
the tow motor wire and cut it and then
you're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> splice<00:02:11.220> them<00:02:11.459> back

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you're going to splice them back

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.700 
you're going to splice them back
together<00:02:11.989> red<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.170> black

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
together red to black

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.370 
together red to black
and<00:02:13.830> black<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.340> red<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.660> simply<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and black to red and then simply just

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.740 
and black to red and then simply just
plug<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.010> back<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:20.510> don't<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.630> my

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
plug it back in here I don't have my

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
plug it back in here I don't have my
glasses<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.410> cut<00:02:22.680> hard<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.010> see

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.630 

there<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.360> go<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.190> I've<00:02:35.400> put

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
there we go all right and then I've put

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.280

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
now look how long this antenna is like

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710 
now look how long this antenna is like
super<00:03:16.920> long<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.880> really<00:03:18.150> helps<00:03:18.570> that

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
gives it a lot more forward motion also

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.070 
gives it a lot more forward motion also
the<00:04:38.650> hell<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.160> take<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.850> battery<00:04:40.270> normally

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.200 
the hell I take the battery normally
they<00:04:41.170> had<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.380> battery<00:04:41.770> crammed<00:04:42.220> way<00:04:42.550> back<00:04:42.850> I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
they had a battery crammed way back I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.080 
they had a battery crammed way back I
take<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.140> battery<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:45.160> move<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.700> forward

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
take the battery and I move it forward

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.930 
take the battery and I move it forward
and<00:04:46.570> then<00:04:46.990> put<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> zip<00:04:47.500> strap<00:04:47.890> around<00:04:48.100> here<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
and then put a zip strap around here and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.970 
and then put a zip strap around here and
that<00:04:49.390> helps<00:04:49.720> give<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> little<00:04:50.290> more<00:04:50.440> forward

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
that helps give a little more forward

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.680 
that helps give a little more forward
motion<00:04:51.370> also<00:04:51.960> okay<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:54.190> once<00:04:55.030> again<00:04:55.180> we've

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
motion also okay so once again we've

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.210 
motion also okay so once again we've
covered<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:57.480> 90<00:04:58.480> using<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.050> 9104<00:04:59.860> tail
