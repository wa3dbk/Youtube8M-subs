00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.900 
t-shirt origami or something I could use
this<00:04:06.440> for<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.920> only<00:04:07.130> one<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.490> we<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.880> use

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
this for it the only one that we can use

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.460 
this for it the only one that we can use
its<00:04:08.209> traditional<00:04:08.840> is

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
its traditional is

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.880 
its traditional is
the<00:04:10.330> short<00:04:11.330> sleeve<00:04:11.480> collared<00:04:12.140> shirt<00:04:12.380> not<00:04:12.650> look

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
the short sleeve collared shirt not look

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.660 
the short sleeve collared shirt not look
weird<00:04:13.130> with<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:14.920> but<00:04:15.920> let<00:04:16.160> me<00:04:16.190> go<00:04:16.340> ahead<00:04:16.459> and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
weird with this but let me go ahead and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.729 
weird with this but let me go ahead and
fold<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.630> see<00:04:17.810> how<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.200> takes<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
fold this and see how it takes the

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.430 
fold this and see how it takes the
pieces<00:04:19.370> here<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.820> I'll<00:04:20.480> show<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.690> guys<00:04:20.959> as<00:04:21.290> I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
pieces here and I'll show you guys as I

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.340 
pieces here and I'll show you guys as I
get<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.980> here<00:04:22.280> what<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:22.850> looks<00:04:23.000> like<00:04:23.350> so

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
get going here what it looks like so

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.990 
get going here what it looks like so
this<00:04:24.560> paper<00:04:24.890> like<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.250> said<00:04:25.550> because<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.880> has

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
this paper like I said because it has

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.390 
this paper like I said because it has
that<00:04:26.180> kind<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.510> wax<00:04:26.840> sort<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.770> finish<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
that kind of wax sort of finish to the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640 
that kind of wax sort of finish to the
backing<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.240> does<00:04:29.450> hold<00:04:29.630> creases<00:04:30.140> really<00:04:30.500> well

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
backing it does hold creases really well

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.830 
backing it does hold creases really well
even<00:04:30.680> though<00:04:31.070> thin<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.360> get<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> pretty

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
even though thin so you can get a pretty

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.580 
even though thin so you can get a pretty
nice<00:04:33.170> finished<00:04:33.800> piece<00:04:34.160> here<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.960> really

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
nice finished piece here and I really

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.260 
nice finished piece here and I really
like<00:04:36.740> these<00:04:36.980> patterns<00:04:37.430> because<00:04:37.910> they<00:04:38.060> have<00:04:38.240> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
like these patterns because they have a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.990 
like these patterns because they have a
nice<00:04:39.190> repetition<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.400> them<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.760> they

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
nice repetition to them so that they

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.210 
nice repetition to them so that they
come<00:04:41.180> together<00:04:41.450> really<00:04:41.810> well<00:04:41.960> when<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.980> put

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
come together really well when you put

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.740 
come together really well when you put
them<00:04:43.430> inside<00:04:43.610> you're<00:04:44.090> going<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.270> get<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.450> really

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
them inside you're going to get a really

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.040 
them inside you're going to get a really
nice<00:04:45.880> merging<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.060> these<00:04:47.270> patterns<00:04:47.600> in<00:04:48.020> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
nice merging of these patterns in the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.090 
nice merging of these patterns in the
middle<00:04:48.380> here<00:04:48.650> at<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.860> inside<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.460> Box<00:04:51.100> get

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
middle here at the inside of the Box get

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.610 
middle here at the inside of the Box get
all<00:04:52.220> this<00:04:52.400> folded<00:04:52.970> over<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.360> tucked<00:04:53.960> inside

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.980 

so<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.680> can<00:04:57.740> kind<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.070> see<00:04:58.340> here<00:04:58.820> how<00:04:59.480> they<00:04:59.750> all

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
so you can kind of see here how they all

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.750 
so you can kind of see here how they all
come<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.650> middle<00:05:00.950> there<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.400> create<00:05:01.730> a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
come to the middle there to create a

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.280 
come to the middle there to create a
nice<00:05:02.000> little<00:05:02.210> line<00:05:02.890> in<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.160> center<00:05:05.290> really

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
nice little line in the center really

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.560 
nice little line in the center really
perfectly<00:05:06.830> lined<00:05:07.190> up<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:07.790> nice<00:05:08.030> kind<00:05:08.450> of

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
perfectly lined up it's nice kind of

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.750 
perfectly lined up it's nice kind of
effect<00:05:09.080> there<00:05:09.380> for<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.040> then<00:05:10.550> on<00:05:10.669> the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
effect there for that and then on the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.040 
effect there for that and then on the
outside<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:11.330> get<00:05:11.480> just<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.810> nice<00:05:12.020> little

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
outside you get just a nice little

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.560 
outside you get just a nice little
simple<00:05:12.890> pattern<00:05:13.310> with<00:05:13.490> these<00:05:13.700> little<00:05:13.910> accents

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
simple pattern with these little accents

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.270 
simple pattern with these little accents
on<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.720> corner<00:05:15.169> which<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.530> really<00:05:15.740> pretty<00:05:16.010> in

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
on the corner which is really pretty in

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.409 
on the corner which is really pretty in
a<00:05:16.490> nice<00:05:16.669> corner<00:05:17.150> on<00:05:17.510> each<00:05:18.110> side<00:05:18.380> too<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:19.550> always

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
a nice corner on each side too so always

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.270 
a nice corner on each side too so always
nice<00:05:20.720> when<00:05:20.750> you<00:05:20.990> can<00:05:21.020> find<00:05:21.290> paper<00:05:21.980> that's

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
nice when you can find paper that's

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.100 
nice when you can find paper that's
designed<00:05:22.730> in<00:05:22.910> patterned<00:05:23.360> well<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:23.990> when

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
designed in patterned well so that when

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.080 
designed in patterned well so that when
you<00:05:24.200> fold<00:05:24.380> things<00:05:24.590> like<00:05:24.800> boxes<00:05:25.280> or<00:05:25.460> flowers<00:05:25.850> or

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
you fold things like boxes or flowers or

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.230 
you fold things like boxes or flowers or
medallions<00:05:27.050> or<00:05:27.460> kusudama<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:28.880> get<00:05:29.090> a

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
medallions or kusudama that you get a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.180 
medallions or kusudama that you get a
really<00:05:29.479> nice<00:05:29.750> kind<00:05:30.260> of<00:05:30.410> merging<00:05:30.890> of<00:05:31.010> those

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
really nice kind of merging of those

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.120 
really nice kind of merging of those
patterns<00:05:31.490> together<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.750> definitely<00:05:33.680> would

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
patterns together so I definitely would

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.980 
patterns together so I definitely would
say<00:05:34.310> this<00:05:34.490> is<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.700> nice<00:05:34.940> fun<00:05:35.330> cute<00:05:35.720> little

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
say this is a nice fun cute little

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.050 
say this is a nice fun cute little
pattern<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.680> paper<00:05:36.919> quality<00:05:37.340> is<00:05:37.490> you

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
pattern and the paper quality is you

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.880 
pattern and the paper quality is you
know<00:05:38.120> pretty<00:05:38.330> high<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.660> print<00:05:39.110> is<00:05:39.290> nice<00:05:39.530> it's

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
know pretty high the print is nice it's

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.780 
know pretty high the print is nice it's
a<00:05:39.979> clean<00:05:40.370> nice<00:05:40.729> print<00:05:41.120> um<00:05:41.419> and<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:43.370> think<00:05:43.640> you

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
a clean nice print um and I think you

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.000 
a clean nice print um and I think you
know<00:05:43.910> for<00:05:44.150> what<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.390> is<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:44.900> forgetting<00:05:45.530> 36

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010
