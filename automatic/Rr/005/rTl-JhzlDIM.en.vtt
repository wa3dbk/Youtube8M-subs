00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 In life there are the words we know like table and dog and those we do not know. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 More surprisingly there are also objects that are used almost every day and that can not be named. 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 But all this will have changed after this top 10. 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
 Number 1: Hectomorph 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600
 You do not know what it is but you have necessarily crossed, 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 the hectomorphs are the swellings that can afford to eat absolutely what they want, 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.460
 While never winning a bead 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.020
 Personally they are called fuckers. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.940
 it holds better and his glue well. 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.140
 Number 2: Philtrum 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.340
 it's the hollow between our mouth and our nose 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.060
 It is also called angel's finger 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.580
 Because according to a legend it is an angel who comes to put his finger pudgy on our face just before birth 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.100
 It's beautiful as a legend, but the shot of the little fat with wings that enters our mother just for his greasy hand on the face, it's more flipper than anything else. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 Number 3. Latin midianus mullet that does not mean TV presenter but is in the middle. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.940
 It is usually a piece of wood or stone that supports a window. So that's so after you get to place: 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.760
 "Ben says so she has a super mullion this window my bastard" 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 In a conversation you are bravo. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 Number 4. Lunula. "Lunula, lunula, lunula, lunula, read ..." 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.180
 The more we repeat, the less it means something this thing. Finally, lunula is the circular and white spot that we all have on the go. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 There for example there are 5 lunules, 5 lu-nules. I do not get used to that word. 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.560
 Number 5: Ferret 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.500
 It's the plastic or iron thing that holds the end of the lace so we can put it in the hole. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.480
 And we secretly live in fear that it breaks. Because when it breaks you can not get the lace back into the small hole and often it's a blow to redeem pumps. 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 Because the laces bought alone, they are always ugly and they never go with the shoes. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 So watch out for the studs. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.520
 Number 6: Lenmiscate. Lemeune iscate. Lemnisceute. Lamenis. Aaah the dog 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.620
 Known since ancient Greek times, Perseus studying spirics has decraved it as a section by a plane of the surface at the ... 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.220
 In fact, it's just the sign of the infinite. 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.120
 Number 7: Vinculum. The word vinculum does not tell you anything but it has rotten a lot of your days. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:59.520
 Because vinculum is the small bar found in the middle of fractions. So if you did not stop in the 4th or you continued on the path of math you have surely continued to cross this little bastard throughout your existence 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 Number 8: Iota 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.580
 Iota is the little point that we find above the j and the i and m too, no it's not true, no but it was a trap to see if you follow. 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.380
 The iota is small and sometimes we forget it is also why we use it in the expression "do not move an iota" 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.860
 As in the sentence "I will not move an iota on it, I will not eat my pizza crusts. 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.480
 Number 9: Ferrule 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 The ferrule a metal ring like the ring that holds the eraser of the pencil or the trick of the opinels or brushes. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 It's still crazy to say that there was a name for metal rings of pencils and we did not know it. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.000
 We were there we went, we went to the bread we bought apples and we did not know that. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Number 10: Petrified 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.360
 Which one without flinching affubler of the title of the ugliest word of the world. can be equal with Kumquat 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.420
 Petichor actually is the smell of the earth after the rain. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.020
 This particular smell that reminds the campaign of my childhood, um sorry, excuse me I do not know what took me, I let myself carried 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.120
 Normally one enriches your vocabulary, is in addition now you had to be ultra scrabble 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.080
