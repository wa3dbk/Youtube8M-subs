00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
right in there and i was going to do my

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.369 
right in there and i was going to do my
cutie<00:00:41.620> in<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:44.489> sterlite<00:00:45.489> tub<00:00:45.760> right<00:00:46.180> here<00:00:46.480> see

cutie in the sterlite tub right here see

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.630 
cutie in the sterlite tub right here see
it<00:00:47.469> all<00:00:47.590> cleaned<00:00:47.860> out<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.039> I<00:00:48.250> realized

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
it all cleaned out and I realized

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.150 
it all cleaned out and I realized
probably<00:00:49.570> just<00:00:49.719> better<00:00:49.899> to<00:00:50.110> do<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.350> in<00:00:50.559> this

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
probably just better to do it in this

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.510 
probably just better to do it in this
tank<00:00:51.399> up<00:00:51.579> here<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:53.620> just<00:00:53.800> have<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.100> filter

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
tank up here and I just have that filter

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.010 
tank up here and I just have that filter
on<00:00:54.640> there<00:00:54.879> I'm<00:00:55.120> going<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.449> seed<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.719> with<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
on there I'm going to seed it with the

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.639 
on there I'm going to seed it with the
little<00:00:56.260> media<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.670> in<00:00:58.210> case<00:00:58.629> but<00:00:59.410> i<00:00:59.469> do<00:00:59.559> plan

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
little media just in case but i do plan

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.639 
little media just in case but i do plan
to<00:00:59.949> do<00:01:00.100> daily<00:01:00.760> water<00:01:00.940> changes<00:01:01.480> on<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> Qt<00:01:02.379> tank

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
to do daily water changes on the Qt tank

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.850 
to do daily water changes on the Qt tank
and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.449> might<00:01:04.689> end<00:01:04.930> up<00:01:05.049> becoming<00:01:05.260> the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
and then that might end up becoming the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.880 
and then that might end up becoming the
home<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:07.420> two<00:01:07.659> of<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:08.020> butterflies<00:01:08.530> because<00:01:08.770> I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
made a hundred and twenty nine dollars

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.260 
made a hundred and twenty nine dollars
for<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.980> fish<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.070> do<00:02:35.550> expect<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.060> he

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
for this fish and I do expect that he

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.930 
for this fish and I do expect that he
will<00:02:36.390> eventually<00:02:36.540> change<00:02:37.610> color<00:02:38.610> because

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
will eventually change color because

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.300 
will eventually change color because
he's<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.380> completely<00:02:40.380> black<00:02:40.770> keys<00:02:41.010> little
