00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.740
 fit, the macho overflowed 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 a love I the Sabine which is day 18 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.970
 my weigh of fitzgeralds today 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.850
 I need your help and I have 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.510
 I've been vaguely worried since yesterday 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 the body fat also measures mine 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.460
 Libra was so far the classic 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 just showed weight but after 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.370
 I suppose it's the biggest supporter anyway 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 the martian of the bandars i can 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.530
 Of course, not just on a kilo 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 Of course, they also leave the display 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.600
 especially with women with the cycle totally 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.420
 fluctuates back and forth and that is why 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 for me actually the body so that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.940
 Klapperfeld the most important indicator like 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 because you change next to natural 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.219
 the teeth on the tape measure is true that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.710
 this vague here and here so here 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.290
 then you just put weight and age 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 one I call weight age and size 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
 And then you have to walk with the feet 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.740
 you have to bare feet on this 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.909
 two metal strips is the send 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.070
 then the vibrations no basta sends 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.020
 into the body they come back 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.509
 and that's why the body fat and then 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 the water content measured I already have 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.680
 can re-measure my body fat is 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.740
 the evaluation no longer exactly what 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.939
 I just roughly remembered that it was 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.579
 in the average to good range 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.200
 located for women at that time in these 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.210
 gym I have the weight 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 measured by his scales you in the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.649
 holds hands and now is just one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.790
 that's what feet do that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 means there can of course 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.310
 fluctuations and I believe 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.149
 anyway, do not dare this now anyway 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.829
 exactly 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.780
 but especially if it is a whole 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.070
 percentage points then you have to go 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.049
 maybe already admit that one 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.210
 did not live as healthy as you did 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.950
 that maybe just now can believe 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 Of course, that's hard to decide 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.740
 because I'm fat in front of my body 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 challenge not measured 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.149
 I have now started again is 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.459
 sport but in this 1 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.230
 yes, not so much was happening to me now 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.260
 It has always been sport but it 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.400
 I do not follow any regular ones 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.230
 also registered in my calendar 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.299
 so that it really would be me 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.200
 It would be important for me to stick to it 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.459
 mean the end of the challenge 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.439
 Body fat again after properly 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.200
 to drive down that also means that 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.640
 I enter a little bit again now 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.810
 eye to throw it that maybe I 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.930
 not really that much going on though I am 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.389
 love it and a little bit more 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.310
 to do specific body exercises so 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.329
 strength training again more in mine 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.329
 to incorporate everyday life 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.659
 Now comes your endgame 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.970
 I have something in front of me and that 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.889
 i want another quad challenge 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.909

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:12.290

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:52.690
 Can I somehow stop that? 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.670
 I'll definitely know that 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.450
