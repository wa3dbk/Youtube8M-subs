00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 and I, because we are here, what mission do you think 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.299
 and we are going to bring the new location of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.460
 the bugs of a line on a map since 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 there were people complaining about where 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 the bugs are leaving etc because they have done the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 a little simpler route and we'll start 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.940
 just leave with these lizards that do not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 we will do it for a massacre because they are 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 there in the mouth not then we go 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 heating doing some that with 500 and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 peak of life each one very warm and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.760
 the boy because they are mario monge have already 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.579
 had me then have complained the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 of bot that when they put it has nothing 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.930
 what disease then river has told you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.690
 without problems we will expose here another 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.450
 lizard because because if more lizard 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.210
 better so here we have to form 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.190
 lizard weapons while we have arm wrestling 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 the line we do not do it quietly 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 those on top also complained that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.610
 they had little chest to form and have 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.410
 planted some wolves in the middle because 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 there was a lot of space and they did not know with what 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950
 fill it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.750
 there you have it 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.210
 all the old camps are 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.699
 river is obviously empty and has 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.190
 past to reform it because they do not have 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.660
 you win here is all empty not also 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.430
 what comments these wolves have 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.020
 there was natural selection for both 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.870
 small ones have disappeared and have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.960
 learned from garen to hide in a 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.980
 cf and ambush the unsuspecting enemies 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 that dare to enter the two giant wolves 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 the thousands were commenting that he had 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.320
 very little that familiar so the river 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 it is said then let's put here two 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.020
 goals inside medium so that while 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.570
 go to lines do them 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.550
 quietly no but they followed 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.030
 complaining then of being a little more 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.060
 get the ghosts out here waiting 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
 Although the enemy is worth the team, 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 bought this ghost to make them 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.710
 to the mid of the red team but the team 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.410
 red has more more settlement has more 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.590
 money and has hired the dragon to 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.960
 that ambush and enter as if it were 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.880
 a fucking wheat phil something weird a look 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.770
 and even one are working even 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.020
 the ghosts is that it is good 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 well that the dragon has paid for it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.270
 red team and you are waiting to search 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.060
 for when the enemy makes some area 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 erroneous the dragon gets to stick to everything 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.020
 what moves 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.630
 in fact it hits 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.050
 and also with everything not 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.500
 good as you see now the enemy goals 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.330
 they are there that are closer to the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.240
 tower because we are doing the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.230
 then they take refuge a little 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.230
 we also have of course 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.120
 the enemy nexus 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.960
 the little wolves the little wolves are closer 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.540
 that our other lizards that will be 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.660
 to change it because that's an advantage 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.310
 very very still not then you have to put 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 the mother wolves men are too 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.620
 near and in addition they are below the tower 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.710
 that is, not that it is not very 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 close last I wanted to tell you about the 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.420
 male who is tired of dying before 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.390
 that both the games and the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.160
 says I already gave step of Isabella and good 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.900
 because we are minutes the man does not 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.730
 appeared or is going to appear or is it 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.830
 proven that the man passes everything 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.280
 and it will not come simply and plainly 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.959
 It's not going to come good as some of you will 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.580
 Of course, this is a huge 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.819
 quite short that there is right now in the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.769
 pp and is that is that is the bugs of 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.010
 old map have been mixed with the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.810
 scenario of the new map and it went out to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 this we are giving my own subjects 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.230
 so when they solve these 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.980
 calm that in life there will not be 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.409
 no goal 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.010
 this thing that is happening here is 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.569
 at least because the diver 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.840
 blue and red in fact not even 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.000
 they are as you have seen in the end I hope 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.010
 that you liked the bromita life 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.190
 favorite of help a lot I'm going to 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.120
 stay here with my brothers and sisters 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.250
 anything 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:13.760
 that is giving birth is putting them 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.760
 the pairs was already good that review
