00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.859
 how is she 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.619
 a granddaughter 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:12.359
 for her 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.959
 therefore 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.719
 palaia 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.859
 the biggest 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.330
 below 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.929
 there is water 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.220
 are the underground water sources 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.949
 up to a certain depth are called groundwater 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.949
 are the landfills and years 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 O 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.739
 springs 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.989
 it is very few to finish the skill 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.850
 but is there an endless source of water beneath the earth 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 and it will be good to drink 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.120
 to understand all this we must know that this groundwater has 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.190
 of the land through special regions called recharge zones 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.830
 and the characteristics of its soil allow rainwater to penetrate 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 deep 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.119
 nor the water of the rivers and lakes reach the bottom of the earth through small 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 cracks in the ground 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.590
 groundwater it is necessary to dig wells 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.670
 very deep are the artesian wells that sometimes reaching 120 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 kilometers deep 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.570
 state owned by the artesian wells is very good for consumption 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.159
 but you can also 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 is subject to pollution 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.230
 the frontier protect the rivers 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.410
 the sides 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 land and recharge areas 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.819
 because that way we will also be protecting groundwater 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.019
 I hate 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.899
 one dead 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.259
 the organ 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.690
 What are these ponds? 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.099
 they are precious heritage 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.389
 riled up 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.669
 to be able to guarantee the survival of the 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.669
 future 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.029
 the ounce 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.789
 for 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.539
 for her 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.139
 now 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:48.799
 palaia
