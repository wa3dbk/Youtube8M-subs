we<00:00:01.890> can<00:00:02.040> also<00:00:02.220> start<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.730> cut<00:00:03.149> your<00:00:03.330> body<00:00:03.449> into

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
we can also start to cut your body into

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.220 
we can also start to cut your body into
section<00:00:04.319> some<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:05.160> often<00:00:05.549> refer<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.230> planes

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
section some we often refer to planes

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.839 
section some we often refer to planes
how<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.099> kind<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.519> slice<00:00:08.910> them<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> when<00:00:11.759> we

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
how we kind of slice them so when we

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.070 
how we kind of slice them so when we
talk<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.030> those<00:00:12.389> particular<00:00:12.630> body

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
talk about those particular body

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.570 
talk about those particular body
sections<00:00:13.559> because<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.160> three<00:00:14.429> specific

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
sections because it's on three specific

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.540 
sections because it's on three specific
planes<00:00:15.440> we<00:00:16.440> talked<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> sagittal

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
planes we talked about the sagittal

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.470 
planes we talked about the sagittal
plane<00:00:18.109> and<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.650> think<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.220> yes<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
plane and I really think that yes it's a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.320 
plane and I really think that yes it's a
vertical<00:00:21.990> plane<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.970> top<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.210> bottom

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
vertical plane so it's in top to bottom

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.040 
vertical plane so it's in top to bottom
up<00:00:24.720> down<00:00:25.019> planes<00:00:25.730> yes<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.090> splits<00:00:27.570> lengthwise

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
up down planes yes it splits lengthwise

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.310 
up down planes yes it splits lengthwise
but<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
but I really think that this one is the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.430 
but I really think that this one is the
key<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.090> you're<00:00:33.270> actually<00:00:33.420> doing<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
key that what you're actually doing is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
key that what you're actually doing is
you're<00:00:34.710> splitting<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> left

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you're splitting the right and the left

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.520 
you're splitting the right and the left
side<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.430> sagittal<00:00:39.360> plane<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
side in a sagittal plane all right so

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
side in a sagittal plane all right so
you're<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.430> taking<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you're really kind of like taking it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.940 
you're really kind of like taking it
straight<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> middle<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.680> body

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
straight down the middle of your body

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
straight down the middle of your body
and<00:00:44.340> splitting<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:44.969> half<00:00:45.210> from<00:00:45.390> your

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and splitting your right half from your

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
and splitting your right half from your
left<00:00:45.719> half<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> mid<00:00:47.280> sagittal

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
left half that would be a mid sagittal

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.940 
left half that would be a mid sagittal
plane<00:00:48.289> straight<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> middle

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
plane straight down the middle

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.119 
plane straight down the middle
alright<00:00:50.430> equal<00:00:51.000> size<00:00:51.210> versus<00:00:52.140> parasagittal

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
alright equal size versus parasagittal

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.880 
alright equal size versus parasagittal
that<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.300> um<00:00:55.219> if<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.300> sliced<00:00:57.300> from

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that would be like um if you sliced from

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.779 
that would be like um if you sliced from
above<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.100> shoulder<00:00:59.579> right<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.420> again

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
above your shoulder right so again

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
above your shoulder right so again
drawing<00:01:02.789> sorry<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:04.860> looking<00:01:05.189> at

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
drawing sorry right if we're looking at

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.719 
drawing sorry right if we're looking at
a<00:01:07.580> body

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a body

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.539 
a body
alright<00:01:11.330> parasagittal<00:01:12.920> would<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.070> dividing

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
alright parasagittal would be dividing

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.920 
alright parasagittal would be dividing
this<00:01:15.360> way

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
this way

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140 
this way
whereas<00:01:16.830> midsagittal<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> been

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
whereas midsagittal would have been

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.920 
whereas midsagittal would have been
straight<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> middle

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
straight down the middle

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
straight down the middle
sorry<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.590> off-center<00:01:19.860> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
sorry it's a little off-center but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
sorry it's a little off-center but
alright<00:01:21.299> satchel<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.350> talking<00:01:22.530> about

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
alright satchel is really talking about

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
alright satchel is really talking about
a<00:01:23.159> slice<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.880> cuts<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> half<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:27.119> we'd<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
a slice it cuts in half then we'd have

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
a slice it cuts in half then we'd have
transverse<00:01:28.229> alright<00:01:29.130> transverse<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
transverse alright transverse which is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.679 
transverse alright transverse which is
horizontal<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.310> creates<00:01:33.030> superior

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
horizontal right this creates superior

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.980 
horizontal right this creates superior
interior<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.470> guess<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:38.900> creates<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
interior I guess this kind of creates a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
interior I guess this kind of creates a
cross-section<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.820> idea<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.149> here's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
cross-section so the idea that here's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.649 
cross-section so the idea that here's
your<00:01:45.979> human<00:01:46.979> body<00:01:47.159> wrong<00:01:49.340> all<00:01:50.340> right

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
your human body wrong all right

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.560 
your human body wrong all right
when<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.750> make<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.930> transfer<00:01:53.530> plane<00:01:54.570> you're

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
when you make a transfer plane you're

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
when you make a transfer plane you're
cutting<00:01:56.070> horizontally<00:01:57.179> all<00:01:58.179> right<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:59.159> then

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
cutting horizontally all right and then

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.749 
cutting horizontally all right and then
coronal<00:02:01.210> right<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> was<00:02:03.429> talking<00:02:03.610> to

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
coronal right is what I was talking to

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.029 
coronal right is what I was talking to
why<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:03.939> need<00:02:04.240> reference<00:02:04.630> -<00:02:04.869> yeah<00:02:05.350> vertical

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
why I need reference - yeah vertical

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.559 
why I need reference - yeah vertical
plane<00:02:06.280> up<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:06.850> down<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.580> coronal

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
plane up and down because a coronal

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.600 
plane up and down because a coronal
plane<00:02:10.860> often<00:02:11.860> called<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.220> frontal<00:02:12.700> plane<00:02:14.610> it's

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
plane often called a frontal plane it's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.080 
plane often called a frontal plane it's
going<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.239> be<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> plane<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.680> vertical<00:02:18.400> but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
going to be a plane that's vertical but

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.820 
going to be a plane that's vertical but
this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.569> going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.290> something<00:02:20.620> that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
this is going to be something that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.199 
this is going to be something that
splits<00:02:21.250> anterior<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.959> was<00:02:23.170> front<00:02:24.209> compared

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
splits anterior which was front compared

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.030 
splits anterior which was front compared
to<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.360> post<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.840> which<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.470> back<00:02:28.980> alright<00:02:29.980> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
to a post here which is back alright so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.370 
to a post here which is back alright so
this<00:02:30.819> kind<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.390> gives<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:31.959> good

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
this kind of gives you a really good

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
this kind of gives you a really good
drawing<00:02:33.069> this<00:02:33.370> diagram<00:02:33.849> this<00:02:34.780> shows<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.680> the

image that would occur as a result of
these<00:02:40.630> different<00:02:41.079> planes<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.829> this<00:02:42.610> shows

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
these different planes and this shows

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.660 
these different planes and this shows
you<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.930> sagittal<00:02:44.769> plane<00:02:44.829> like<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.370> said

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
you that a sagittal plane like I said

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.210 
you that a sagittal plane like I said
you<00:02:46.209> can<00:02:46.450> split<00:02:47.310> right<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:49.230> left<00:02:50.230> versus

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
you can split right and left versus

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.869 
you can split right and left versus
transverse<00:02:51.790> top<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.780> bottom<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
transverse top and bottom and then you

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.479 
transverse top and bottom and then you
have<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.390> frontal<00:02:56.170> plane<00:02:56.470> alright

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
have that frontal plane alright

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.059 
have that frontal plane alright
that<00:02:57.700> coronal<00:02:58.299> plane<00:02:58.769> we're<00:02:59.769> just<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
that coronal plane we're just going to

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:11.780 
that coronal plane we're just going to
split<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.819> front<00:03:01.950> from<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:02.980> back

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690 

this<00:03:12.420> drawing<00:03:12.689> really<00:03:13.019> does<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> nice<00:03:14.010> job<00:03:14.069> of

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
this drawing really does a nice job of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.899 
this drawing really does a nice job of
demonstrating<00:03:15.230> Frank<00:03:16.489> here<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
demonstrating Frank here we have that

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.770 
demonstrating Frank here we have that
transverse<00:03:21.109> plane<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.849> you<00:03:23.849> know<00:03:24.230> splitting

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
transverse plane it's you know splitting

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:39.490 
transverse plane it's you know splitting
top<00:03:27.780> from<00:03:28.079> bottom<00:03:29.629> versus<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:36.920> that

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
top from bottom versus we have here that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.979 
top from bottom versus we have here that
partl<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:41.189> frontal<00:03:41.670> plane<00:03:41.939> that's<00:03:42.659> splitting

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
partl or frontal plane that's splitting

front<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.980> back<00:03:44.159> and<00:03:45.120> then<00:03:45.540> at<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.230> same<00:03:46.260> time

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
front to back and then at the same time

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:56.110 
front to back and then at the same time
we<00:03:47.609> have<00:03:50.989> this<00:03:51.989> diagram<00:03:53.180> or<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.329> plane

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
we have this diagram or this plane

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.890 
we have this diagram or this plane
that's<00:03:57.120> splitting<00:03:58.760> right<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.030> left<00:04:00.239> alright

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
that's splitting right to left alright

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.020 
that's splitting right to left alright
so<00:04:01.769> hopefully<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.370> kind<00:04:02.579> helps<00:04:02.819> you<00:04:02.879> guys

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
so hopefully this kind helps you guys

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.210 
so hopefully this kind helps you guys
visualize<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:04.010> um<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:06.299> result<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:07.220> making

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
visualize it um as a result of making

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.649 
visualize it um as a result of making
these<00:04:08.930> planes<00:04:09.930> are<00:04:10.260> creating<00:04:10.739> these<00:04:10.859> planes

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
these planes are creating these planes

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.839 
these planes are creating these planes
oftentimes<00:04:12.659> you<00:04:13.139> kind<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.470> get<00:04:13.680> sections<00:04:14.340> so

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
oftentimes you kind of get sections so

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.789 
oftentimes you kind of get sections so
you<00:04:14.939> can<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.209> cross<00:04:15.450> section<00:04:16.139> right<00:04:16.349> which

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
you can have a cross section right which

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.789 
you can have a cross section right which
typically<00:04:17.930> alright<00:04:18.930> we're<00:04:19.169> pretty<00:04:19.620> familiar

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
typically alright we're pretty familiar

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.199 
typically alright we're pretty familiar
with<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.250> cross<00:04:20.430> section<00:04:20.820> allows<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
with the cross section allows you to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.180 
with the cross section allows you to
kind<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.419> like<00:04:21.599> look<00:04:21.840> straight<00:04:22.590> down<00:04:22.830> into

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
kind of like look straight down into

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.100 
kind of like look straight down into
something<00:04:23.760> all<00:04:24.210> right<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.690> had<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> picture

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
something all right you had a picture

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.529 
something all right you had a picture
before<00:04:25.680> when<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:26.370> were<00:04:26.400> talking<00:04:26.520> about<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
before when we were talking about the

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.439 
before when we were talking about the
different<00:04:28.110> membranes<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.979> when<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.849> refer<00:04:30.419> to

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
different membranes and when I refer to

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.750 
different membranes and when I refer to
refer<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.409> membranes<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.490> thoracic

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
refer to the membranes of the thoracic

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.480 
refer to the membranes of the thoracic
cavity<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.750> was<00:04:34.229> showing<00:04:34.409> you<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.590> diagram<00:04:35.099> of

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
cavity I was showing you a diagram of

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.990 
cavity I was showing you a diagram of
the<00:04:36.260> pleural<00:04:37.260> membrane<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.159> the<00:04:38.370> pericardial

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
the pleural membrane and the pericardial

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.390 
the pleural membrane and the pericardial
membrane<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.690> showing<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.289> how<00:04:40.620> those<00:04:41.190> are

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
membrane and showing you how those are

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580 
membrane and showing you how those are
specifically<00:04:42.110> wrapping<00:04:43.110> around<00:04:43.260> that

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
specifically wrapping around that

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.140 
specifically wrapping around that
infrastructure<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.310> just<00:04:44.580> like<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.789> showed<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
infrastructure is just like I showed you

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.620 
infrastructure is just like I showed you
in<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.510> abdominal<00:04:46.500> pelvic<00:04:46.789> cavity<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.360> those

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
in the abdominal pelvic cavity and those

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.210 
in the abdominal pelvic cavity and those
were<00:04:48.810> both<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.440> all<00:04:49.530> sections<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.099> you

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
were both for all sections that you

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.279 
were both for all sections that you
looked<00:04:50.430> at<00:04:51.320> oblique<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:53.310> going<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.729> be<00:04:53.849> that

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
looked at oblique is going to be that

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.469 
looked at oblique is going to be that
angled<00:04:55.289> cut<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.250> then<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.210> have

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
angled cut and then you have

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.860 
angled cut and then you have
longitudinal<00:04:58.159> which<00:04:59.159> is<00:04:59.419> lengthwise<00:05:00.419> small

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
longitudinal which is lengthwise small

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.540 
longitudinal which is lengthwise small
right<00:05:02.990> longitudinal<00:05:03.990> long<00:05:04.830> ways<00:05:06.919> in<00:05:07.919> addition

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
right longitudinal long ways in addition

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.529 
right longitudinal long ways in addition
we<00:05:09.479> also<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:10.070> specific<00:05:11.070> terms<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:12.120> we<00:05:12.330> need

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
we also have specific terms that we need

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.779 
we also have specific terms that we need
to<00:05:12.630> start<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:12.960> get<00:05:13.080> used<00:05:13.289> to<00:05:13.470> using<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
to start to get used to using so the

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.140 
to start to get used to using so the
idea<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.240> no<00:05:15.389> longer<00:05:15.659> using<00:05:16.580> everyday<00:05:17.580> terms

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
idea is no longer using everyday terms

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.709 
idea is no longer using everyday terms
when<00:05:18.810> we<00:05:18.840> refer<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:19.460> anatomical<00:05:20.460> parts<00:05:21.029> of<00:05:21.570> the

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
when we refer to anatomical parts of the

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.920 
when we refer to anatomical parts of the
body<00:05:21.900> um<00:05:22.229> it's<00:05:22.620> really<00:05:22.770> about<00:05:23.099> using<00:05:23.430> the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
body um it's really about using the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.040 
body um it's really about using the
correct<00:05:24.440> Anatomy<00:05:25.039> terms<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.970> no<00:05:26.180> longer<00:05:26.570> using

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
correct Anatomy terms so no longer using

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.290 
correct Anatomy terms so no longer using
the<00:05:27.229> word<00:05:27.410> arm<00:05:28.100> but<00:05:29.000> instead<00:05:29.710> same<00:05:30.710> drakey<00:05:31.039> oh

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
the word arm but instead same drakey oh

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.939 
the word arm but instead same drakey oh
all<00:05:32.300> right<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.810> idea<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:33.139> no<00:05:33.320> longer<00:05:33.680> staying

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
all right the idea of no longer staying

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.710 
all right the idea of no longer staying
chest<00:05:35.020> saying<00:05:36.020> pectoral<00:05:37.009> all<00:05:37.940> right<00:05:38.060> no

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
chest saying pectoral all right no

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.939 
chest saying pectoral all right no
longer<00:05:39.169> staying

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
longer staying

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.379 
longer staying
I<00:05:40.000> just<00:05:41.229> orbital<00:05:42.229> right<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.280> so<00:05:43.789> on<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.090> so<00:05:44.240> on

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
I just orbital right and so on and so on

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.700 
I just orbital right and so on and so on
so<00:05:44.570> it's<00:05:44.720> really<00:05:44.780> important<00:05:45.320> for<00:05:45.350> you<00:05:45.500> guys<00:05:45.560> to

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
so it's really important for you guys to

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.800 
so it's really important for you guys to
kind<00:05:46.100> of<00:05:46.160> start<00:05:46.400> learning<00:05:47.150> these<00:05:47.300> charms

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
kind of start learning these charms

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.620 
kind of start learning these charms
getting<00:05:48.080> familiar<00:05:48.410> with<00:05:48.650> these<00:05:48.770> terms<00:05:49.009> and

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
getting familiar with these terms and

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.029 
getting familiar with these terms and
practicing<00:05:50.630> using<00:05:50.810> these<00:05:51.169> terms<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:51.860> would

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
practicing using these terms I would

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.129 
practicing using these terms I would
highly<00:05:52.430> suggest<00:05:52.460> perhaps<00:05:53.120> making<00:05:53.660> yourself

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
highly suggest perhaps making yourself

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.370 
highly suggest perhaps making yourself
some<00:05:54.350> flashcards<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:56.020> remembering<00:05:57.020> what

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
some flashcards and remembering what

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.469 
some flashcards and remembering what
each<00:05:57.800> of<00:05:57.979> these<00:05:58.070> are<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.699> never<00:05:58.880> know<00:05:59.120> when

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
each of these are you never know when

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:06.370 
each of these are you never know when
it's<00:05:59.930> gonna<00:06:00.080> pop<00:06:00.380> up<00:06:00.590> fun<00:06:00.979> test<00:06:01.280> on<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:05.380> in

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
it's gonna pop up fun test on so in

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.950 
it's gonna pop up fun test on so in
addition<00:06:06.650> we<00:06:07.310> can<00:06:07.460> also<00:06:07.639> divide<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.720> human

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
addition we can also divide the human

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.060 
addition we can also divide the human
body<00:06:09.110> up<00:06:09.289> into<00:06:09.530> regions<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.910> talk<00:06:11.870> about

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
body up into regions and talk about

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.580 
body up into regions and talk about
regions<00:06:13.070> of<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.280> body<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:13.990> specific<00:06:14.990> terms

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
regions of the body and specific terms

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.520 
regions of the body and specific terms
of<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.039> body<00:06:16.220> with<00:06:16.490> regions<00:06:17.000> on<00:06:17.360> this<00:06:18.050> kind<00:06:18.320> of

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
of the body with regions on this kind of

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.010 
of the body with regions on this kind of
is<00:06:18.680> a<00:06:18.710> bit<00:06:19.009> more<00:06:19.280> about<00:06:19.580> body<00:06:19.849> organization<00:06:20.840> I

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
is a bit more about body organization I

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.159 
is a bit more about body organization I
guess<00:06:21.699> but<00:06:22.699> it's<00:06:23.449> not<00:06:23.660> really<00:06:23.960> about<00:06:24.050> our

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
guess but it's not really about our

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.499 
guess but it's not really about our
cavities<00:06:24.830> and<00:06:25.009> our<00:06:25.130> membranes<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.820> such<00:06:26.060> um

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
cavities and our membranes and such um

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.540 
cavities and our membranes and such um
it's<00:06:26.750> really<00:06:26.870> about<00:06:27.139> just<00:06:27.199> kind<00:06:27.560> of<00:06:27.680> dividing

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
it's really about just kind of dividing

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.100 
it's really about just kind of dividing
up<00:06:28.639> the<00:06:28.789> body<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.360> looking<00:06:29.539> at<00:06:29.720> it<00:06:29.840> in

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
up the body and looking at it in

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.170 
up the body and looking at it in
quadrants<00:06:30.860> or<00:06:31.070> something<00:06:31.699> along<00:06:31.880> those<00:06:32.060> lines

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
quadrants or something along those lines

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.779 
quadrants or something along those lines
so<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:34.270> can<00:06:35.270> see<00:06:35.449> here<00:06:36.050> that<00:06:36.590> we<00:06:37.190> really<00:06:37.220> just

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
so you can see here that we really just

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.460 
so you can see here that we really just
create<00:06:38.210> as<00:06:38.449> you<00:06:38.599> can<00:06:38.870> see<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.380> grid<00:06:39.949> right<00:06:41.470> the

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
create as you can see a grid right the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.890 
create as you can see a grid right the
grid<00:06:42.680> right<00:06:42.889> across<00:06:43.130> the<00:06:43.520> body<00:06:43.699> and<00:06:44.210> kind<00:06:44.720> of

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
grid right across the body and kind of

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.279 
grid right across the body and kind of
label<00:06:45.680> all<00:06:46.220> of<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.669> different<00:06:47.090> portions<00:06:47.900> of

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
label all of the different portions of

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:53.409 
label all of the different portions of
the<00:06:49.449> grid<00:06:50.449> so<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:52.370> right<00:06:52.580> with<00:06:52.699> hypochondriac

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
the grid so the right with hypochondriac

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.540 
the grid so the right with hypochondriac
region<00:06:53.900> versus<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:54.409> left<00:06:54.620> hypochondriac

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
region versus the left hypochondriac

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.420 
region versus the left hypochondriac
region<00:06:56.000> versus<00:06:56.659> be<00:06:56.840> at<00:06:57.080> the<00:06:57.229> gastric<00:06:57.680> region

versus the umbilical region umbilical

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.110 
versus the umbilical region umbilical
we're<00:07:01.070> talking<00:07:01.310> like<00:07:01.430> a<00:07:01.460> belly<00:07:01.639> button<00:07:01.909> region

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
we're talking like a belly button region

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 
specifically quadrants so instead of

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.360 
specifically quadrants so instead of
using<00:07:25.610> nine<00:07:26.389> regions<00:07:27.110> it's<00:07:27.770> specifically

using nine regions it's specifically

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.010 
using nine regions it's specifically
going<00:07:28.580> to<00:07:28.699> talk<00:07:28.940> about<00:07:29.120> the<00:07:29.419> right<00:07:29.659> upper
