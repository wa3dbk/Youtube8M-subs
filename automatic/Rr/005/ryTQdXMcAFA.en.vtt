00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
say was the same wonderful machine now

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
say was the same wonderful machine now
just<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.790> get<00:02:36.910> some<00:02:37.120> sense<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.570> all<00:02:37.750> the

there<00:03:18.610> was<00:03:18.850> some<00:03:19.269> variation<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.680> we

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
there was some variation in what we

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
might call operating systems at the turn

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.560 
might call operating systems at the turn
of<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.590> century<00:03:23.769> some<00:03:24.549> people<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> chip

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
of the century some people like to chip

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.680 
of the century some people like to chip
keys<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:26.440> three<00:03:26.680> rows<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.890> keys<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.150> you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690
