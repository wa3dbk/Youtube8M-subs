so<00:02:51.049> we<00:02:51.200> got<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.379> pretty<00:02:51.769> nice<00:02:52.340> amount<00:02:52.670> Aleut

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
so we got a pretty nice amount Aleut

00:02:52.969 --> 00:03:13.030 
so we got a pretty nice amount Aleut
there<00:03:02.439> as<00:03:03.439> we<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:11.680> let's<00:03:12.680> go<00:03:12.859> ahead<00:03:12.890> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
there as we do that let's go ahead and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.069 
there as we do that let's go ahead and
attack<00:03:13.340> again<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:17.000> look<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:18.019> an

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
attack again and I just look for an

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.280 
attack again and I just look for an
inactive<00:03:18.500> base<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.889> I<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:19.250> pause<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.670> video

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
inactive base and I just pause the video

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.720 
inactive base and I just pause the video
just<00:03:21.290> until<00:03:21.739> i<00:03:21.769> found<00:03:22.010> an<00:03:22.189> atan<00:03:22.370> ectopy

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
just until i found an atan ectopy

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.539 
just until i found an atan ectopy
sometimes<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.359> takes<00:03:23.540> me<00:03:23.780> out<00:03:24.220> cool<00:03:25.220> minutes

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
sometimes it takes me out cool minutes

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.420 
sometimes it takes me out cool minutes
to<00:03:25.700> find<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:26.180> sometimes<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.930> just

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
to find it but sometimes it's just

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.210 
to find it but sometimes it's just
automatically<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.419> first<00:03:29.599> base<00:03:30.220> but

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
automatically it's the first base but

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.569 
automatically it's the first base but
this<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.669> a<00:03:31.700> really<00:03:32.599> nice<00:03:32.750> raid<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.139> I<00:03:33.169> had

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
this is a really nice raid that I had

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.479 
this is a really nice raid that I had
got<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> lot<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.000> resources<00:03:35.389> here<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.370> we're

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
got a lot of resources here so we're

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.520 
got a lot of resources here so we're
just<00:03:37.549> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.819> grab<00:03:38.030> all<00:03:38.540> these<00:03:38.930> resources

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
just going to grab all these resources

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.920 
just going to grab all these resources

the<00:04:36.340> battle<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.639> I<00:04:36.940> wasn't<00:04:37.569> worried<00:04:37.810> about

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
the battle but I wasn't worried about

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.469

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
I'll reason you want to do this after

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.559 
I'll reason you want to do this after
every<00:04:51.400> single<00:04:51.729> raid<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.580> they<00:04:54.819> don't<00:04:55.000> one

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
every single raid is so they don't one

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.110 
every single raid is so they don't one
of<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.720> barracks<00:04:55.960> doesn't<00:04:56.349> run<00:04:56.560> out<00:04:57.120> because

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
of the barracks doesn't run out because

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.490 
like two raids or three raids and it's
not<00:05:03.220> as<00:05:03.370> fast<00:05:05.099> alright<00:05:06.099> so<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.370> have<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:07.500> this

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
time to strike all the defenses and then

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.140 
time to strike all the defenses and then
just<00:05:50.650> get<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.800> couple<00:05:51.009> archers<00:05:51.460> put<00:05:51.729> them<00:05:51.940> down

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
just get a couple archers put them down

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.439 
just get a couple archers put them down
and<00:05:52.419> go<00:05:53.199> to<00:05:53.259> shoot<00:05:53.620> over<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:54.069> wall<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.460> the

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
and go to shoot over the wall and the

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.850 
and go to shoot over the wall and the
reason<00:05:55.719> I<00:05:55.750> don't<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:56.020> like<00:05:56.169> goblins<00:05:56.710> for

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
reason I don't you like goblins for

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.430 
reason I don't you like goblins for
farming<00:05:57.430> is<00:05:58.270> because<00:05:58.719> of<00:05:58.750> those<00:05:59.020> collectors

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
farming is because of those collectors

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.769 
farming is because of those collectors
inside<00:06:00.039> of<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.279> wall<00:06:00.490> as<00:06:00.789> you<00:06:01.419> can<00:06:01.539> see<00:06:01.659> this

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
inside of the wall as you can see this

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.300 
inside of the wall as you can see this
archers<00:06:02.199> are<00:06:02.349> just<00:06:02.529> shooting<00:06:02.800> right<00:06:03.009> over<00:06:03.219> the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
archers are just shooting right over the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.430 
archers are just shooting right over the
wall<00:06:03.520> so<00:06:03.849> a<00:06:04.090> wall<00:06:04.630> would<00:06:04.810> be<00:06:04.900> a<00:06:04.930> problem<00:06:05.199> for

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
wall so a wall would be a problem for

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.040 
wall so a wall would be a problem for
the<00:06:05.590> goblins<00:06:06.039> and<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.520> would<00:06:06.639> be<00:06:06.840> harder<00:06:07.840> to

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
the goblins and it would be harder to

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.010 
the goblins and it would be harder to
get<00:06:08.889> the<00:06:09.130> loot<00:06:09.250> inside<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.909> walls<00:06:10.120> so<00:06:10.750> that<00:06:10.779> is

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
get the loot inside the walls so that is

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.670 
get the loot inside the walls so that is
why<00:06:11.199> i<00:06:11.849> prefer<00:06:12.849> archers

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
why i prefer archers

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.270
