00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello good today to teach to prepare a 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.450
 nutella cake bowl 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.900
 in the microwave is super easy to make 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.820
 and it has ingredients that we all have 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.340
 at home flour sugar an egg nesquik 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.220
 nutella milk and vegetable oil that comes 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.230
 to be the sunflower 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 is prepared super fast now you 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.200
 I will teach how it is done is super simple 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.590
 and it's great, we're going to start 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.530
 elaborate what's worth I'm going to enter all the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.769
 measures with a spoon is worth a spoon 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.769
 of these little ones so it's worth 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.810
 we started with 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.810
 four tablespoons of flour 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.720
 3 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 but it is already 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 I recommend that you take a good bowl 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.050
 big because this then goes up then 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.050
 It is worth 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 two 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.790
 3 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.790
 4 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.460
 egg 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.859
 ah 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 three spoonfuls of nÃ©spoli 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.580
 if it can be queued cao and others but 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.580
 I like to do school 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.990
 of milk 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.740
 one 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 now 3 sunflower vegetable oil 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.989
 we give 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 one 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.200
 do not 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.230
 one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
 two 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.570
 do not 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.100
 and now after all this ping of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.030
 disgust 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.030
 they mix 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.310
 already take another consistency and when you see 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.280
 that we already have lumps of these 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.180
 it's worth more 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 and to continue 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.290
 the list for the party 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.360
 but 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.470
 now all this little one we are going to put 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.350
 in the microwave one and a half minutes or 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.590
 three of us are tired but I do not 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.590
 everyone 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.430
 ah 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.299
 two 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.299
 at 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.240
 when you put it in the microwave you have 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.760
 to be aware that we do not know 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.610
 overflow for the good cup and this is the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.730
 result as 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.460
 as you will see, it looks like a sponge cake 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.010
 but nutella is pretty hot 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.050
 be careful when you touch it and if 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.290
 you see that it smells great is 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.730
 normal that goes away because when I 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.799
 put in the microwave you start to 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.470
 bloat without charles swell but then 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.080
 low I recommend that you put a 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.610
 little cream over it because 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.560
 it will be great 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.349
 I 'm going to show you how I prepare myself 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.810
 before eating bad that is with cream worth 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.810
 but I have done over virutitas of 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.810
 colors 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.660
 here 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.289
 plus 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.310
 and so it's great, I hope that you 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.520
 have liked it if you try it to do 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.419
 at home send me a comment 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.860
 you see already doing it the opinion and such and 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.860
 I hope you like ciao
