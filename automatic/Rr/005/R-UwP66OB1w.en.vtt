00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
cylinder bores now what does all that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.420 
cylinder bores now what does all that
mean<00:00:31.289> that's<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> explain

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
mean that's what I'm going to explain

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
mean that's what I'm going to explain
right<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> choke<00:00:34.230> tube<00:00:34.469> does<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
right now so what a choke tube does is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.250 
right now so what a choke tube does is
basically<00:00:35.790> control<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> spread<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> your

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
basically control the spread of your

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
basically control the spread of your
shot<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:38.070> shot<00:00:38.340> comes<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.000> shotgun

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
shot when shot comes out of your shotgun

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.970 
shot when shot comes out of your shotgun
you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.110> pellets<00:00:40.530> they're<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you know little pellets they're going to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
you know little pellets they're going to
be<00:00:41.040> flying<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.550> over<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> need<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> be

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
be flying all over so you need to be

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.240 
be flying all over so you need to be
able<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> control<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> depending<00:00:44.010> what

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
able to control that depending what

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
able to control that depending what
you're<00:00:44.460> doing<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.600> instance<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:45.930> you're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you're doing so for instance if you're

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.299 
you're doing so for instance if you're
shooting<00:00:46.260> turkey<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.920> actually<00:00:47.190> have

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
shooting turkey they actually have

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889 
shooting turkey they actually have
turkey<00:00:47.789> choke<00:00:48.120> tubes<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.570> they're<00:00:48.690> called

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
turkey choke tubes or they're called

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
turkey choke tubes or they're called
extra<00:00:49.320> full<00:00:49.500> choke<00:00:49.800> tubes<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.610> really

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
extra full choke tubes and that really

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
extra full choke tubes and that really
keeps<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> tight<00:00:51.690> pattern<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> shot<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
keeps a tight pattern on that shot it

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.130 
keeps a tight pattern on that shot it
doesn't<00:00:53.460> let<00:00:53.579> them<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.270> expand<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
doesn't let them really expand out and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
doesn't let them really expand out and
you<00:00:55.500> need<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.070> hunting<00:00:56.460> turkey<00:00:56.789> because

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you need that one hunting turkey because

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250 
you need that one hunting turkey because
you're<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.449> longer<00:00:57.629> distance<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you're a little bit longer distance and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
you're a little bit longer distance and
you<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> tight<00:00:59.100> group<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.609> shot

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you need a tight group on your shot

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
you need a tight group on your shot
because<00:01:00.449> usually<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:00.930> looking<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
because usually you're looking for that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
because usually you're looking for that
head<00:01:01.710> hit<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> need<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.670> tight

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
head hit so you need a really tight

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
head hit so you need a really tight
pattern<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> shot<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.559> an<00:01:04.680> extra

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
pattern on that shot so that's an extra

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
pattern on that shot so that's an extra
full<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.430> turkey<00:01:06.060> choke<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.140> down

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
full or turkey choke then you go down

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
full or turkey choke then you go down
the<00:01:07.409> line<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> full<00:01:08.400> choke<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the line now we have a full choke and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
the line now we have a full choke and
that's<00:01:09.360> still<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.140> tight

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that's still going to be a pretty tight

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.109 
that's still going to be a pretty tight
pattern<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.130> tight<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> turkey<00:01:11.880> choke

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pattern not as tight as a turkey choke

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
pattern not as tight as a turkey choke
but<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> give<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> pretty

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
but it's going to give you a pretty

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
but it's going to give you a pretty
tight<00:01:13.500> pattern<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.760> out

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
tight pattern so as you're going out

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
tight pattern so as you're going out
there<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.750> pattern<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.259> shot<00:01:16.439> states<00:01:16.799> tight

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there the pattern of shot states tight

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.380 
there the pattern of shot states tight
so<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:17.970> able<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> little

so you're going to be able get a little

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
so you're going to be able get a little
bit<00:01:18.479> further<00:01:18.720> shots<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.950> full<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bit further shots and you use full of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
bit further shots and you use full of
full<00:01:20.640> choke<00:01:20.909> tubes<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.570> trap<00:01:22.049> shooting<00:01:22.350> if

you can also use a full choke for

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
you can also use a full choke for
Turkish<00:01:30.270> shooting<00:01:30.509> again<00:01:30.780> next<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:31.920> the

to<00:01:34.200> give<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.159> spread

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to give you a little bit more spread

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
to give you a little bit more spread
than<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> full<00:01:36.509> choke<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.740> use

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
than a full choke to will and you use

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
than a full choke to will and you use
modified<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.509> closer

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
modified for a lot of just closer

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.340 
modified for a lot of just closer
waterfowl<00:01:40.770> closer<00:01:41.189> duck<00:01:41.610> hunting<00:01:42.350> definitely

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
waterfowl closer duck hunting definitely

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.840 
waterfowl closer duck hunting definitely
a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.560> longer<00:01:43.950> distance<00:01:44.310> upland<00:01:44.729> game

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a little bit longer distance upland game

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.609 
a little bit longer distance upland game
it<00:01:45.060> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> fills<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> border<00:01:46.500> right

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it kind of fills in that border right

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.960 
it kind of fills in that border right
there<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> water

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
there so you have a little bit of water

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
there so you have a little bit of water
fall<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> upland<00:01:49.439> game<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
fall a little bit of upland game and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.109 
fall a little bit of upland game and
that's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.460> modified<00:01:50.909> choke

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that's going to be your modified choke

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
that's going to be your modified choke
and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.509> also<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:51.869> modified<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.560> trap

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and you can also use modified for trap

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.460 
and you can also use modified for trap
shooting<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.520> again<00:01:53.869> next<00:01:54.869> down<00:01:55.110> line<00:01:55.350> is

you have improved improve is going to be

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
you have improved improve is going to be
leaving<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.869> wider<00:01:58.140> spread<00:01:58.590> then

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
leaving a little bit wider spread then

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
leaving a little bit wider spread then
that<00:01:59.369> modified<00:01:59.850> improved<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.750> great<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.259> most

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that modified improved is great for most

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
that modified improved is great for most
upland<00:02:01.770> game<00:02:01.890> hunting<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.759> great<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.149> small

category as well on the bottom end of
that<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> cylinder<00:02:15.960> bore<00:02:16.260> a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that is you have a cylinder bore a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.260 
that is you have a cylinder bore a
cylinder<00:02:17.070> bore<00:02:17.250> means<00:02:17.460> there<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.790> no<00:02:18.000> choke

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
cylinder bore means there is no choke

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.300 
cylinder bore means there is no choke
tube<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.930> straight<00:02:19.290> no<00:02:19.830> choke<00:02:20.100> tube

fits in the end of your barrel and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630 
fits in the end of your barrel and
that's<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.590> used<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.070> military<00:02:23.520> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that's really used for military and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's really used for military and
police<00:02:23.790> applications<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.380> last<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.740> we

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
police applications now the last one we

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500 
police applications now the last one we
talk<00:02:26.040> about<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.730> skeet<00:02:27.210> choke

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
talk about is actually a skeet choke

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
talk about is actually a skeet choke
tube<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.770> bit<00:02:28.860> different<00:02:29.160> than

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
tube it's a little bit different than

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.380 
tube it's a little bit different than
the<00:02:29.370> improved<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> little<00:02:30.090> bit<00:02:30.180> wider

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the improved you have a little bit wider

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.000 
the improved you have a little bit wider
pattern<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.500> specifically

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
pattern and it's really specifically

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
pattern and it's really specifically
designed<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.550> skeet<00:02:32.940> all-around<00:02:33.660> skeet

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
designed for skeet all-around skeet

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.760 
designed for skeet all-around skeet
shooting<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.350> great

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
shooting it's great

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.200 
shooting it's great
I<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:35.310> wouldn't<00:02:35.460> use<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:35.910> too<00:02:36.090> much

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I really wouldn't use it for too much

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
I really wouldn't use it for too much
more<00:02:36.480> than<00:02:36.990> skeet<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:37.710> has<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
more than skeet it really has that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.250 
more than skeet it really has that
design<00:02:38.340> purpose<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.390> choke<00:02:39.750> tubes<00:02:39.990> are<00:02:40.140> going

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
design purpose so choke tubes are going

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.720 
design purpose so choke tubes are going
to<00:02:40.320> screw<00:02:40.530> into<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.860> end<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.430> barrel

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to screw into the end of your barrel

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
to screw into the end of your barrel
most<00:02:42.510> shotguns<00:02:42.750> nowadays<00:02:43.440> are<00:02:43.680> designed<00:02:44.040> with

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
most shotguns nowadays are designed with

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.949 
most shotguns nowadays are designed with
a<00:02:44.250> removable<00:02:44.610> choke<00:02:45.030> tube<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.750> can

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
a removable choke tube so you can

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.510 
a removable choke tube so you can
literally<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.200> unscrew<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.830> most<00:02:47.130> shotguns

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
literally just unscrew it most shotguns

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.890 
literally just unscrew it most shotguns
actually<00:02:47.820> come<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.150> choke<00:02:48.420> tube<00:02:48.660> wrench

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
actually come with a choke tube wrench

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.480 
actually come with a choke tube wrench
so<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.770> little<00:02:49.950> wrench<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.430> your

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
so you get that little wrench in your
