rice washer you put the rice in there

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
rice washer you put the rice in there
and<00:01:56.359> you<00:01:57.799> stir<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> water<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.490> there's

and you stir the water and then there's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.830 
and you stir the water and then there's
holes<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.929> bottom<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.090> here<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.299> pour<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
holes in the bottom and here to pour the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
holes in the bottom and here to pour the
water<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> rice<00:02:05.280> washer<00:02:07.220> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
water out so that's a rice washer this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
water out so that's a rice washer this
is<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:10.349> colander<00:02:11.300> okay<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.900> what's<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
is a colander okay now what's the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.089 
is a colander okay now what's the
difference<00:02:14.280> between<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:15.090> colander<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.099> a

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
difference between a colander and a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.630 
difference between a colander and a
strainer<00:02:18.260> basically<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.769> size<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> holes

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
strainer basically the size of the holes

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.110 
strainer basically the size of the holes
and<00:02:21.110> what<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.260> use<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.640> use<00:02:23.879> this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and what you use it for so I use this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.770 
and what you use it for so I use this
mainly<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.900> pasta<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.280> washing<00:02:26.819> salad<00:02:27.420> or

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
mainly for pasta or for washing salad or

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.270 
mainly for pasta or for washing salad or
lettuce<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.769> vegetables<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.959> for<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.920> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
lettuce and vegetables and for this I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.250 
lettuce and vegetables and for this I
might<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.599> holes<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> little

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
might use it the holes are a little

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.839 
might use it the holes are a little
smaller<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.239> use<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.690> maybe<00:02:36.989> for

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
smaller and I would use this maybe for

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.740 
smaller and I would use this maybe for
straining<00:02:39.409> sauces<00:02:40.409> or<00:02:41.030> juices<00:02:42.030> something

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750

mesh<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.349> strainer<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.890> even<00:02:56.250> finer<00:02:56.670> and

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
mesh on this strainer is even finer and

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.910 
mesh on this strainer is even finer and
I<00:02:58.319> use<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.069> tea<00:03:00.060> basically<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.019> put<00:03:01.349> tea

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
I use this for tea basically I put tea

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.059 
I use this for tea basically I put tea
leaves<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:03.330> don't<00:03:03.870> use<00:03:04.019> teabags<00:03:04.530> very<00:03:04.830> much

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
leaves I don't use teabags very much

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.940 
leaves I don't use teabags very much
here<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.120> tea<00:03:06.840> leaves<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.319> then<00:03:07.530> pour<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
here so tea leaves and then pour the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.770 
here so tea leaves and then pour the
water<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.909> strains<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.659> tea<00:03:11.540> okay

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
water and that strains the tea okay

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.440 
water and that strains the tea okay
next<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.480> masher<00:03:16.849> usually<00:03:17.849> used<00:03:18.180> for

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
next this is a masher usually used for

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.960 
next this is a masher usually used for
meshing<00:03:19.080> potatoes<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.189> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.670> mash

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
meshing potatoes but you can mash

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.369 
meshing potatoes but you can mash
anything<00:03:21.689> with<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.379> suppose<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:23.299> I

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
anything with this I suppose if I

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.720 
anything with this I suppose if I
remember<00:03:25.379> when<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.590> was<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> child<00:03:25.920> my<00:03:26.370> mother

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
remember when I was a child my mother

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.470 
remember when I was a child my mother
made<00:03:27.180> mashed<00:03:27.629> carrots<00:03:28.439> I<00:03:29.120> didn't<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.299> it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
made mashed carrots I didn't like it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.270 
made mashed carrots I didn't like it
very<00:03:30.510> much<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.260> she<00:03:31.590> loved<00:03:31.890> it

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
very much but she loved it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.319 
very much but she loved it
so<00:03:35.209> now<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.989> I'm<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.650> introduce<00:03:37.829> you

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
so now here I'm going to introduce you

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.740 
so now here I'm going to introduce you
introduce<00:03:39.329> three<00:03:39.810> things<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:41.689> these<00:03:42.689> are

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
introduce three things to you these are

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.770 
introduce three things to you these are
all<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:45.000> same<00:03:45.329> name<00:03:45.750> okay<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:47.129> is<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> spatula

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
all the same name okay this is a spatula

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.660 
all the same name okay this is a spatula
this<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> spatula<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.189> is<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> spatula

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
this is a spatula and this is a spatula

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.990 
this is a spatula and this is a spatula
now<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.900> again<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.799> might<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.250> more<00:03:53.489> common

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
now this again this might be more common

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.259 
now this again this might be more common
in<00:03:54.180> Japan<00:03:54.959> because<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:56.730> use<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.269> for<00:03:57.689> rice

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
in Japan because we use this for rice

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.440 
in Japan because we use this for rice
you<00:04:00.269> can<00:04:00.450> see<00:04:00.659> there's<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.489> bumps<00:04:02.489> on<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
you can see there's little bumps on the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.300 
you can see there's little bumps on the
surface<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:04.849> this<00:04:05.849> helps<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.540> rice<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.739> come

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
surface and this helps the rice to come

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.040 
surface and this helps the rice to come
off<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.760> spatula<00:04:09.000> not<00:04:09.390> stick

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
off the spatula not stick

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.980 
off the spatula not stick
to<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.680> easily<00:04:10.710> although<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:12.330> find<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
to it so easily although I find that the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.220 
to it so easily although I find that the
rice<00:04:13.170> sticks<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:13.950> anyway<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.450> don't<00:04:16.140> know

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
rice sticks to it anyway so I don't know

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.970 
rice sticks to it anyway so I don't know
how<00:04:16.410> useful<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.959> spatula<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
how useful that is this is a spatula and

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.210 
how useful that is this is a spatula and
so<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.519> okay<00:04:21.299> now<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:22.220> rubber

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
so is this okay now this is a rubber

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.570 
so is this okay now this is a rubber
spatula<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.470> what<00:04:26.040> we<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.280> call<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
spatula and this is what we just call a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.350 
spatula and this is what we just call a
spatula<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.180> course<00:04:27.360> they're<00:04:27.510> both<00:04:27.690> made<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.860> I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
spatula of course they're both made of I

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.080 
spatula of course they're both made of I
don't<00:04:30.360> know<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:31.590> was<00:04:31.770> plastic<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.550> some<00:04:32.760> sort

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
don't know this was plastic of some sort

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.320 
don't know this was plastic of some sort
and<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.110> course<00:04:34.140> has<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.470> rubber<00:04:35.330> now

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
and this of course has the rubber now

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.120 
and this of course has the rubber now
one<00:04:36.540> thing<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.170> recently<00:04:37.680> some<00:04:38.100> people

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
one thing is that recently some people

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.760 
one thing is that recently some people
are<00:04:38.760> calling<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:40.190> flipper<00:04:41.190> or<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.580> Turner

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
are calling this a flipper or a Turner

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.040 
are calling this a flipper or a Turner
because<00:04:43.770> you're<00:04:43.920> turning<00:04:44.220> eggs<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.300> this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
because you're turning eggs with it this

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.440 
because you're turning eggs with it this
is<00:04:46.470> used<00:04:47.840> basically<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.730> just<00:04:50.730> scrape<00:04:51.090> the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
is used basically to just scrape the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.010 
is used basically to just scrape the
bowl<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:52.260> after<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.430> mix<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:54.030> cake<00:04:54.300> or<00:04:54.600> cookie

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
bowl out after you mix a cake or cookie

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.420 
bowl out after you mix a cake or cookie
batter<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.910> some<00:04:56.910> people<00:04:57.180> call<00:04:57.510> this<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:58.430> bowl

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
batter and some people call this a bowl

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.630 
batter and some people call this a bowl
scraper<00:05:00.320> but<00:05:01.320> they're<00:05:01.470> both<00:05:01.620> spatulas<00:05:02.340> and

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
scraper but they're both spatulas and

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.380 
scraper but they're both spatulas and
you<00:05:03.510> know<00:05:03.750> which<00:05:04.170> one<00:05:04.500> by<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.280> context<00:05:06.210> if

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
you know which one by the context if

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.450 
you know which one by the context if
you're<00:05:06.570> baking<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:07.080> cake<00:05:07.290> you'll<00:05:08.040> need<00:05:08.280> this

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
you're baking a cake you'll need this

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.750 
you're baking a cake you'll need this
one<00:05:08.760> if<00:05:09.000> you're<00:05:09.260> cooking<00:05:10.260> eggs<00:05:10.680> you're<00:05:11.640> gonna

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
one if you're cooking eggs you're gonna

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.830 
one if you're cooking eggs you're gonna
need<00:05:12.030> this<00:05:12.360> one

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
need this one

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.830 
need this one
so<00:05:13.050> they're<00:05:13.350> both<00:05:13.470> spatulas<00:05:14.100> but<00:05:14.370> recently

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
so they're both spatulas but recently

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.450 
so they're both spatulas but recently
some<00:05:15.840> people<00:05:16.110> call<00:05:16.320> this<00:05:16.560> one<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.800> Turner<00:05:17.130> and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
some people call this one a Turner and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.620 
some people call this one a Turner and
this<00:05:18.090> one<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:19.400> scraper<00:05:20.400> or<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.669> bowl<00:05:20.940> scraper<00:05:21.180> and

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
this one a scraper or a bowl scraper and

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.100 
this one a scraper or a bowl scraper and
now<00:05:22.320> recently<00:05:22.800> they're<00:05:23.130> made<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.669> silicone<00:05:25.370> so

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
now recently they're made of silicone so

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.900 
now recently they're made of silicone so
so<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.260> not<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.440> rubber<00:05:28.770> spatula<00:05:29.160> maybe<00:05:29.700> it's

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
so it's not a rubber spatula maybe it's

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.750 
so it's not a rubber spatula maybe it's
a<00:05:30.000> silicone<00:05:30.450> spatula
