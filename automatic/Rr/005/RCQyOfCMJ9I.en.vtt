facilities<00:00:03.120> behind<00:00:03.510> me<00:00:03.689> was<00:00:04.680> set<00:00:04.859> up

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
facilities behind me was set up

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.740 
facilities behind me was set up
specifically<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.210> mountain<00:00:06.509> people

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
specifically for the mountain people

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.110 
specifically for the mountain people
possums<00:00:07.170> there<00:00:07.680> are<00:00:07.770> no<00:00:07.890> pilot<00:00:08.250> species<00:00:08.700> so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
possums there are no pilot species so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.730 
possums there are no pilot species so
they<00:00:09.840> need<00:00:10.370> temperatures<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.969> drop<00:00:12.030> down<00:00:12.740> in

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
they need temperatures that drop down in

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:25.580 
they need temperatures that drop down in
winter<00:00:22.640> temperatures<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> Australia's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
winter temperatures now that Australia's

only<00:00:26.570> hibernating<00:00:27.570> massive<00:00:27.960> viewers<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
only hibernating massive viewers so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
only hibernating massive viewers so
we're<00:00:29.400> simulating<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.390> conditions<00:00:30.990> inside

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
we're simulating the conditions inside

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.030 
we're simulating the conditions inside
these<00:00:31.619> rooms<00:00:35.600> today<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.079> took<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> our

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
these rooms today we took up two of our

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.260 
these rooms today we took up two of our
little<00:00:38.610> Club<00:00:38.790> week-old

rivers and mountain pygmy cousins took

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
rivers and mountain pygmy cousins took
them<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> hospital<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> owh

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
them up to the hospital up to the owh

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
them up to the hospital up to the owh
sea<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:45.030> essentially<00:00:45.809> their<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.230> bit

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
sea and was essentially their first bit

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
sea and was essentially their first bit
check<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> look<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.750> their<00:00:48.960> teeth

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
check so we have a look at their teeth

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.360 
check so we have a look at their teeth
their<00:00:50.219> eyes<00:00:50.370> their<00:00:50.820> ears<00:00:51.170> they<00:00:52.340> had<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
their eyes their ears they had a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
their eyes their ears they had a
microchip<00:00:53.730> inserted<00:00:54.449> into<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
microchip inserted into them so that we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
microchip inserted into them so that we
can<00:00:55.500> identify<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.699> future<00:00:56.850> because

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
can identify them in the future because

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
can identify them in the future because
they<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> same<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
they all pretty much look the same and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
they all pretty much look the same and
we<00:00:59.969> also<00:01:00.120> took<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.629> tear<00:01:00.870> sampling<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
we also took a little tear sampling so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
we also took a little tear sampling so
that<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.300> send<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.840> genetic

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that we can send that off for genetic

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.240 
that we can send that off for genetic
analysis<00:01:09.290> unfortunately<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.530> been<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
analysis unfortunately there's been a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.660 
analysis unfortunately there's been a
lot<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> change<00:01:12.570> happening<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.350> their<00:01:14.070> natural

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
lot of change happening to their natural

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.030 
lot of change happening to their natural
habitat<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.119> we've<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.140> ski<00:01:16.380> villages<00:01:16.860> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
habitat so we've got ski villages up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.600 
habitat so we've got ski villages up
sort<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> where<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> possums<00:01:18.240> used<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> live

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
sort of where the possums used to live

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
sort of where the possums used to live
we've<00:01:20.610> put<00:01:20.880> roads<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> boulder

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
we've put roads through the boulder

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
we've put roads through the boulder
fields<00:01:22.770> where<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.430> guys<00:01:23.549> actually

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
fields where these little guys actually

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.679 
fields where these little guys actually
liked

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
liked

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.289 
liked
we've<00:01:25.899> inferred<00:01:26.259> so<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:27.039> has<00:01:27.299> cause

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
we've inferred so it has cause

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.609 
we've inferred so it has cause
fragmentation<00:01:29.100> change<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.729> damage<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.179> the

up there
climate<00:01:35.619> change<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.270> potentially<00:01:37.270> also<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.600> big

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
climate change is potentially also a big

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.730 
climate change is potentially also a big
issue<00:01:37.899> for<00:01:38.109> these<00:01:38.409> fellows<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.909> do<00:01:39.969> need

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
issue for these fellows they do need

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.910 
issue for these fellows they do need
good<00:01:42.340> snow<00:01:42.939> cover<00:01:43.210> in<00:01:43.420> winter<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:44.140> order<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.530> to

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
good snow cover in winter in order to to

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.899 
good snow cover in winter in order to to
hibernate<00:01:45.340> properly<00:01:47.790> climate<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:48.880> changing

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
hibernate properly climate is changing

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.020 
hibernate properly climate is changing
and<00:01:49.390> we're<00:01:49.570> having<00:01:50.070> warmer<00:01:51.070> winters<00:01:51.670> and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and we're having warmer winters and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.910 
and we're having warmer winters and
we're<00:01:52.149> not<00:01:52.210> getting<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.689> discover<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
we're not getting the discover the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.320 
we're not getting the discover the
mountain<00:01:54.189> people<00:01:54.399> possums<00:01:54.789> won't<00:01:55.090> hibernate

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
mountain people possums won't hibernate

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.020 
mountain people possums won't hibernate
so<00:01:55.840> well<00:01:56.159> which<00:01:57.159> means<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:57.789> may<00:01:57.970> be

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
so well which means that they may be

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.779 
so well which means that they may be
waking<00:01:58.840> up<00:01:58.979> arousing<00:01:59.979> during<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.280> period<00:02:00.640> where

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
waking up arousing during a period where

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.230 
waking up arousing during a period where
they<00:02:00.909> would<00:02:01.090> be<00:02:01.659> hibernating<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.820> every<00:02:04.060> time

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
they would be hibernating and every time

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.730 
they would be hibernating and every time
they<00:02:04.390> wake<00:02:04.570> up<00:02:04.780> from<00:02:04.840> hibernation<00:02:05.140> they<00:02:05.590> do

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
they wake up from hibernation they do

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.100 
they wake up from hibernation they do
but<00:02:06.039> its<00:02:06.159> body<00:02:06.280> weight<00:02:06.549> so<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.720> generally

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
but its body weight so it's generally

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.229 
but its body weight so it's generally
not<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.319> lot<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.530> food<00:02:08.709> around<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.220> winter<00:02:09.550> and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
not a lot of food around in winter and

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.420 
not a lot of food around in winter and
so<00:02:10.869> hibernation<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> way<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.099> they<00:02:12.250> can

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so hibernation is a way that they can

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.520 
so hibernation is a way that they can
skip<00:02:13.239> through<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.720> period<00:02:14.080> where<00:02:14.350> there's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
skip through that period where there's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.729 
skip through that period where there's
