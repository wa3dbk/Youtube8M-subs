 knife and poisoned nature take on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.929
 the tops of the light it fits well in your pocket 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 it is very comfortable in the hand 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:52.649
 even here it is a handle with a slot all 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.850
 equal in hand goes very well it 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.319
 so much 440 keeps it fine 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 controlled by one hand perfectly 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.389

 after i bought it preload then 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.010
 there he was little promoted 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 but java is pressed only once 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.740
 I didn’t sharpen my cheeks 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.060
 only used here mu used not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 well, there is no need to cut 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 packaging open the principle he 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.180
 flashed the video is already such a sausage 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 Of course, bread cut without the very 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.660
 himself spent some tests but 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.990
 Unfortunately, I didn’t plan at all 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.090
 shoot this video here but since the knife 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.290
 I still decided to take me with me. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 I'll show you by the leaf, that is, you can see 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.730
 maybe it cuts perfectly even with me 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.810
 just don't have any paper with you here 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:54.120
 stick what let's go and cut up chtoli here 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.600
 sorry for that 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.060
 that the legs are very convenient to cut here 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.300
 some shavings mug doing something very 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 lucky for the same kind of money can 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:20.830
 just not afraid to break here 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:22.989
 look how wood is cut to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.290
 the same is his normal strong liner 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.430
 he has a pretty fat liner if 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.480
 I will not be guided now 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.110
 afterwards 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.120
 at home on the table and show it all 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.799
 his liners are almost the same in 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.540
 thickness may well be a millimeter thinner than 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.440
 blade itself 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 Here are all the parameters will naturally 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:55.030
 rewritten as a video understand how here 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.489
 button I want to say well what can I do 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.019

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.900
 horse which you can get 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.730
 pleasure it looks too I can not 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.190
 say that he looked ugly 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.410
 he looks good he is comfortable 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.600
 Feels like it in my hand 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.609

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.120
 not that i was outside supporters will tell you 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.560
 I was just somewhat feared 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.160
 thought well maybe something maybe not 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.690
 so now i have full 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.700
 sure that you can take 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.310
 more expensive models here Hanse 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.419
 completely normal and perfectly 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.599
 normal knife is perfectly normal 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.459
 firm here because when i took this 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.239
 knife people started screaming that you have it 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.180

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.910
 just closing it 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:09.159
 Well, the other side of course was 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:11.049
 it is interesting to experience the blade 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.580
 it is convenient to rest here myself 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.989

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.919

 that is, the knife is just fine and 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 to a large account it is someone who says that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.419
 I do not like your screws to let go 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.690

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.910
