or you know an event that took place

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.340 
or you know an event that took place
that<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.980> particularly<00:03:11.180> emotional<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.750> or

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and that is something that I find that

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.800 
and that is something that I find that
whenever<00:03:19.500> they<00:03:19.830> slow<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.520> down<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
whenever they slow it down like that and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.780 
whenever they slow it down like that and
and<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.070> also<00:03:23.250> true<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.550> songs

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and then this is also true with songs

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.880 
and then this is also true with songs
like<00:03:23.910> with<00:03:24.150> trees<00:03:24.450> off<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
usually one or two on each record that's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.140 
usually one or two on each record that's
able<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.550> where<00:03:32.850> the

talent just exudes itself you have to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.090 
talent just exudes itself you have to
remember<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:45.030> these<00:03:45.420> guys<00:03:46.100> originally

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
remember that these guys originally

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.980 
remember that these guys originally
started<00:03:47.340> off<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.330> way<00:03:48.450> back<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.870> nineteen

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990

yeah<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.420> probably<00:03:55.170> surprising<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.070> think

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
yeah it's probably surprising to think

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.570 
yeah it's probably surprising to think
that<00:03:56.460> but<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.350> reason<00:03:58.680> why<00:03:59.010> that

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
that but that is the reason why that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and it is arguably at least in my

opinion one of my favorite aspects of
their<00:04:10.680> discography<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.600> band<00:04:13.370> now

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
their discography and of this band now

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.280 
their discography and of this band now
considering<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.330> such<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.780> darkened

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
considering this is such a darkened

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.070 
considering this is such a darkened
themed<00:04:16.680> album<00:04:16.980> they<00:04:17.970> also<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.570> increase

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
themed album they also have to increase

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.099 
themed album they also have to increase
the<00:04:19.290> heaviness<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.799> little

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
the heaviness a little

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.189 
the heaviness a little
and<00:04:20.409> that<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:20.979> something<00:04:21.219> that<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:22.199> actually

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
and that is something that is actually

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.020 
and that is something that is actually
quite<00:04:23.349> true<00:04:23.770> if<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.219> thought<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.669> band<00:04:24.909> was

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
quite true if you thought this band was

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.670 
quite true if you thought this band was
heavy<00:04:25.270> before<00:04:25.689> you<00:04:25.930> should<00:04:26.139> definitely<00:04:26.319> hear

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
heavy before you should definitely hear

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.679

version and i'll tell you why in a

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.659 
version and i'll tell you why in a
second<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.169> very<00:04:35.469> last<00:04:35.889> track<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
second the very last track on the

finished version which is absent in the
english<00:04:38.650> version<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:39.189> a<00:04:39.969> damn<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> powerful

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
english version is a damn a powerful

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.730 
english version is a damn a powerful
powerful<00:04:42.750> example<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.560> is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
powerful example of that this is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.499 
powerful example of that this is
probably<00:04:45.009> one<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.580> hardest<00:04:45.879> songs<00:04:46.240> that

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
probably one of the hardest songs that

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.570 
probably one of the hardest songs that
I've<00:04:46.599> ever<00:04:46.629> heard<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.259> band<00:04:47.500> put<00:04:47.770> out<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.370> it

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.520 
I've ever heard this band put out and it
really<00:04:48.879> just<00:04:48.969> has<00:04:49.300> reminiscence<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:49.990> even<00:04:50.349> a

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
really just has reminiscence of even a

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.629 
really just has reminiscence of even a
hint<00:04:51.159> a<00:04:51.490> very<00:04:52.150> slight<00:04:52.810> hint<00:04:53.199> of<00:04:53.319> a<00:04:53.860> doom<00:04:54.189> sound

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
hint a very slight hint of a doom sound

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.570 
hint a very slight hint of a doom sound
in<00:04:54.909> it<00:04:55.029> that<00:04:55.599> is<00:04:55.779> Alec<00:04:56.169> handle<00:04:56.529> mass<00:04:56.710> in<00:04:56.979> fact

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
in it that is Alec handle mass in fact

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.879 
in it that is Alec handle mass in fact
the<00:04:58.180> first<00:04:58.360> time<00:04:58.659> that<00:04:58.689> I<00:04:58.900> heard<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.439> opening

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
the first time that I heard the opening

the first time that I heard the opening
to<00:05:00.039> this<00:05:00.159> crushing<00:05:00.610> finale<00:05:00.939> I<00:05:01.509> thought<00:05:02.139> to

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
to this crushing finale I thought to

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.469 
to this crushing finale I thought to
myself<00:05:02.500> wait<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.460> second<00:05:03.909> I<00:05:03.969> feel<00:05:04.180> like<00:05:04.330> I've

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
myself wait a second I feel like I've

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.209 
myself wait a second I feel like I've
heard<00:05:04.750> this<00:05:04.900> before<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.529> feel<00:05:05.979> like<00:05:06.069> they're

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
heard this before I feel like they're

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.580 
heard this before I feel like they're
doing<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.520> cover<00:05:06.789> but<00:05:07.629> for<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.930> my<00:05:08.050> research<00:05:08.259> up

at at this point that is not the case
and<00:05:11.189> considering<00:05:12.189> that's<00:05:12.370> not<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> case

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
discrepancy all depending on which of

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.439 
discrepancy all depending on which of
the<00:05:46.839> two<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.259> decide<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.680> undertake<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:48.449> first

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
the two you decide to undertake I first

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.809 
the two you decide to undertake I first
noticed<00:05:49.870> this<00:05:50.020> because<00:05:50.439> in<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:51.370> version<00:05:51.759> I

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
noticed this because in the version I

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.219 
noticed this because in the version I
had<00:05:52.000> which<00:05:52.120> was<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.360> english<00:05:52.689> version<00:05:52.719> i

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
had which was the english version i

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.839 
had which was the english version i
noticed<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:53.770> two<00:05:53.979> songs<00:05:54.250> had<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.580> little

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
noticed that two songs had a little

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.550 
noticed that two songs had a little
highlight<00:05:55.270> next<00:05:55.509> to<00:05:55.569> them<00:05:55.689> that<00:05:55.870> said<00:05:56.020> english

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
highlight next to them that said english

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.040 
highlight next to them that said english
version<00:05:56.949> and<00:05:57.550> i<00:05:57.669> thought<00:05:57.849> and<00:05:58.060> then<00:05:58.719> you

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
version and i thought and then you

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.540 
version and i thought and then you
listen<00:05:59.349> to<00:05:59.439> them<00:05:59.589> and<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.800> realize<00:06:00.400> they're

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
listen to them and you realize they're

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.189 
listen to them and you realize they're
both<00:06:00.699> instrumental<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.479> I<00:06:01.960> thought<00:06:02.139> to

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
both instrumental and I thought to

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.170 
both instrumental and I thought to
myself<00:06:02.289> will<00:06:03.009> that<00:06:03.189> kind<00:06:03.430> of<00:06:03.490> sucks<00:06:03.789> does

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
myself will that kind of sucks does

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.459 
myself will that kind of sucks does
this<00:06:04.300> mean<00:06:04.569> that<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.810> lyrics<00:06:05.199> are<00:06:05.289> on<00:06:05.379> the

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
this mean that the lyrics are on the

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.559 
this mean that the lyrics are on the
finished<00:06:05.800> version<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.879> I<00:06:06.939> pop<00:06:07.150> over<00:06:07.479> the

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
finished version so I pop over the

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.079 
finished version so I pop over the
finished<00:06:07.870> version<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.550> no<00:06:09.550> that's<00:06:09.879> actually

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
finished version and no that's actually

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.189 
finished version and no that's actually
not<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.389> case<00:06:10.479> at<00:06:10.750> all<00:06:10.870> they're<00:06:11.169> just

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
not the case at all they're just

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.649 
not the case at all they're just
instrumental<00:06:12.129> tracks<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.669> don't<00:06:13.330> know<00:06:13.419> called

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
instrumental tracks I don't know called

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.110 
instrumental tracks I don't know called
at<00:06:13.779> a<00:06:13.960> gear<00:06:14.199> whatever<00:06:14.620> but<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.819> finished

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
at a gear whatever but the finished

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.879 
at a gear whatever but the finished
version<00:06:16.270> ultimately<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:17.199> superior<00:06:17.589> because

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
version ultimately is superior because

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.740 
version ultimately is superior because
not<00:06:18.400> only<00:06:18.430> is<00:06:18.699> it<00:06:18.819> in<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.180> band's<00:06:19.360> native

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
not only is it in the band's native

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.679 
not only is it in the band's native
tongue<00:06:19.990> but<00:06:20.199> it<00:06:20.469> is<00:06:20.560> also<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.569> longer<00:06:22.569> version

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:22.689 
tongue but it is also the longer version

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.110 
tongue but it is also the longer version
of<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.169> album<00:06:23.349> that<00:06:23.979> contains<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.610> final

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
of the album that contains that final

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.820 
of the album that contains that final

different<00:07:22.180> numerical<00:07:22.330> structure<00:07:23.080> for<00:07:23.260> the

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.289 
different numerical structure for the

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.790 
different numerical structure for the
way<00:07:23.440> in<00:07:23.560> which<00:07:23.650> i<00:07:23.800> rate<00:07:23.979> albums<00:07:24.460> so<00:07:25.210> i<00:07:25.800> don't

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
know if i were to do it on a star system

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.300 
know if i were to do it on a star system
i'd<00:07:28.810> give<00:07:28.960> this<00:07:29.080> a<00:07:29.139> 4<00:07:29.410> out<00:07:29.500> of<00:07:29.560> 5<00:07:29.740> stars<00:07:30.070> that's

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310 
i'd give this a 4 out of 5 stars that's

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.189 
i'd give this a 4 out of 5 stars that's
