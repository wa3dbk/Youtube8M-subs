00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello everyone here reason 'welcome to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.250
 channel and welcome to a new video on 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.750
 this case something relatively brief but 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.790
 possibly quite important 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
 especially for those who are 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.509
 thinking about following the details 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.030
 different conferences that are going to have 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.130
 place soon during the e3 of this 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 same year that you already know that the event 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.199
 as such it takes place from day 16 a day 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 18 but the lectures are going to start 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 from early morning on Monday to the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.340
 early morning of Wednesday in the schedule 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.230
 Spanish speaking of course so in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 this case you asked me a lot 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 is that if at the end I was going to do the same 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 that last year retransmitting from 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 the channel from here perfectly the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 lectures in Spanish and giving 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.469
 our opinion about it I say our 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.629
 because I will not be alone, much less 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.739
 I would be accompanied by good companions 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.210
 and best friends of course and also 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.199
 apart from that apart from informing you of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 that in the end yes I'm going to do 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.170
 also came of course to comment 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 a little what will be the different 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.609
 schedules or the different events and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 moments of course of the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 lectures in any way do not you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.189
 worry if you do not stay with 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.870
 all the hours even though we the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.210
 keep putting on screen 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.740
 and putting the events every day in 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 direct the programs and with enough 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 time so you can be 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 attentive but still let's make a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.730
 quick review of when they will have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 place the different conferences I will 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.460
 give two schedules is to say 1 schedule 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 Spanish since I am from Spain and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.610
 practically half of my audience 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.850
 it is supposed to be from Spain according to the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 Youtube analytics waves and also os 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.620
 I will give mexico time since 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 according to the youtube analysis 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 about one third of you 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.570
 You are of Mexican origin and I know that a lot 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 people from other Latin American countries 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.960
 I'm sorry I can not give you all the hours 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.850
 but we could stick here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 perfectly 10 minutes to list 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
 all the different uses to the schedules 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.820
 so I'm going to quickly give you both 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.260
 different schedules and then you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.490
 in your house because what are the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.990
 accounts and you are from another site 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.340
 so let's start first with 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.940

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.370

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.370
 another conference also that will have 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.290
 place early on Wednesday in 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.990
 concrete at 2 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 Spanish at 7 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.140
 exactly not specified 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.310
 still what is going to be treated is supposed to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.350
 is going to talk about video games for 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.060
 computer but you do not know what companies 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.860
 will appear there so I still do not know 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.420
 very good if it's really worth it 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.400
 discuss it or not but good , and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.260
 we'll decide on the fly I guess so 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.420
 that these would be a little different 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.880
 conference schedules as you already 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.400
 I said I will go creating different events 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.290
 as the day and the evening progress 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.420
 in fact on Sunday afternoon by 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 example and prepare the event for the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.930
 early Monday morning so also 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.110
 we are attentive to the channel of course and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.450
 I informed you that those days the series of 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.400
 channel like that of alan wake and maybe the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.500
 Steam rebates may not be visible 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 so much since I'll be more focused on 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.490
 do these direct and also in doing 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.230
 then when they finish their live 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.210
 summaries of the different conferences 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.770
 with the most important brief summaries 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.320
 for those who do not want to see you all 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.280
 the direct for example so good me 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.020
 I think there's nothing more to add 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.730
 we are very attentive to the channel to not 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.140
 miss any detail of e3 without anything 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.820
 more than my part thank you very much for 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.820
 have seen it be happy and see you
