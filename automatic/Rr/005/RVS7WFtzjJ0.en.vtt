00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
tape right here's my duct tape second I

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.440 
tape right here's my duct tape second I
are<00:03:03.959> did<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.799> sides<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.819> save

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
are did one of the sides just to save

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.030 
are did one of the sides just to save
time<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.069> video<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.109> this<00:03:10.109> one<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.709> think

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
time in the video and this one I think

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.979 
time in the video and this one I think
won't<00:03:11.700> take<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.209> long<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:15.299> should<00:03:15.569> that

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
won't take so long so you should that

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.650 
won't take so long so you should that
should<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.260> good<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.940> first<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.359> ahead<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
should be good then first go ahead and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:30.020 
should be good then first go ahead and
tape<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.560> down<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.639> you<00:03:29.639> can<00:03:29.849> go

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
tape this down like that and you can go

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.470 
tape this down like that and you can go
ahead<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.329> do<00:03:30.569> one<00:03:31.019> one<00:03:31.290> layer<00:03:31.530> view<00:03:32.310> 10<00:03:33.000> will

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
ahead and do one one layer view 10 will

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.909 
ahead and do one one layer view 10 will
check<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.720> uh<00:03:34.879> I'll<00:03:35.879> go<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.989> another<00:03:37.019> quick

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
check on uh I'll go do another quick

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.490 
check on uh I'll go do another quick
after<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.700> video<00:03:39.000> probably<00:03:39.359> do<00:03:39.569> more<00:03:39.599> just<00:03:40.230> I

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
after the video probably do more just I

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.189 
after the video probably do more just I
don't<00:03:40.769> want<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.340> take<00:03:41.579> too<00:03:41.819> much<00:03:42.709> time<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.280> yeah

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
don't want to take too much time so yeah

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:54.830 
don't want to take too much time so yeah
then<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:51.870> hear<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:52.919> me<00:03:53.099> bend<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.609> bit<00:03:53.910> that

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
then I hear out me bend this a bit that

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.069 
then I hear out me bend this a bit that
should<00:03:55.109> work<00:03:55.139> good<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:57.269> will<00:03:57.629> have<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
should work good you will have to

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.339 
should work good you will have to
probably<00:03:58.290> do<00:03:58.470> some<00:03:58.879> bending<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.720> stuff<00:04:01.079> I

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
probably do some bending and stuff I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.199 
probably do some bending and stuff I
kind<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.680> doubt<00:04:01.889> that<00:04:01.949> you're<00:04:02.669> going<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:03.000> have

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
kind of doubt that you're going to have

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.220 
kind of doubt that you're going to have
a<00:04:03.599> wire<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.440> set<00:04:04.919> up<00:04:05.069> for<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.340> perfectly<00:04:06.230> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
a wire that set up for you perfectly and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.890 
a wire that set up for you perfectly and
kind<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.590> what<00:04:07.709> you're<00:04:07.859> looking<00:04:07.889> for<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
kind of what you're looking for is the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.530 
kind of what you're looking for is the
wire<00:04:10.109> goes<00:04:10.440> down<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.829> middle<00:04:11.099> of<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.669> the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
wire goes down the middle of this the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.050 
wire goes down the middle of this the
top<00:04:12.870> part<00:04:13.199> that's<00:04:13.560> holding<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.370> onto<00:04:14.579> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
top part that's holding it onto the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.180 
top part that's holding it onto the
barrel<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.079> on

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
barrel and on

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.050 
barrel and on
this<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:18.060> want<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.420> wire<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.780> go<00:04:18.959> pretty<00:04:19.739> high

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
this you want the wire to go pretty high

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
this you want the wire to go pretty high
may<00:04:21.060> right<00:04:21.299> here<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:22.380> right<00:04:22.740> here<00:04:22.770> though<00:04:23.310> on

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
may right here not right here though on

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.900 
may right here not right here though on
this<00:04:23.910> little<00:04:24.120> slant<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.220> even<00:04:26.220> just<00:04:26.670> hire

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
this little slant but even just hire

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.610 
this little slant but even just hire
because<00:04:27.060> that's<00:04:27.390> got<00:04:27.630> what's<00:04:28.080> going<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.440> give

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
because that's got what's going to give

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.470 
because that's got what's going to give
you<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.920> best<00:04:29.190> part<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.440> just<00:04:31.440> drop<00:04:31.740> something

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
you the best part I just drop something

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.240 
you the best part I just drop something
no<00:04:33.480> I<00:04:33.750> think<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:36.200> yeah<00:04:37.200> then<00:04:37.440> go<00:04:38.040> ahead<00:04:38.130> and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
no I think so yeah then go ahead and

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.080 
no I think so yeah then go ahead and
take<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.490> down<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:41.490> make<00:04:41.730> sure<00:04:41.910> you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
take that down and just make sure you

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.530 
take that down and just make sure you
have<00:04:42.210> about<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.570> bite<00:04:43.290> size<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> tape<00:04:44.540> before

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
have about the bite size a tape before

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.790 
have about the bite size a tape before
doing<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:52.020> did<00:04:52.200> not<00:04:52.410> make<00:04:52.650> this

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
doing that and and I did not make this

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.740 
doing that and and I did not make this
mod<00:04:53.210> by<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.270> way<00:04:55.250> there<00:04:56.250> are<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.850> lot<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.540> people

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
mod by the way there are a lot of people

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.290 
mod by the way there are a lot of people
have<00:04:58.350> done<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.250> think<00:04:59.970> there<00:05:00.090> might<00:05:00.240> be

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
have done this I think there might be

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.560 
have done this I think there might be
one<00:05:00.600> other<00:05:00.780> guy<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.350> took<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.590> does<00:05:02.040> it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
one other guy and you took that does it

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.250 
one other guy and you took that does it
but<00:05:03.570> he<00:05:03.720> does<00:05:03.840> he<00:05:04.140> does<00:05:04.320> on<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.530> Recon<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.010> think

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
but he does he does on the Recon I think

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.140 
but he does he does on the Recon I think
but<00:05:07.260> yeah<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.310> pretty<00:05:08.580> original

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
but yeah it's just a pretty original

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.770 
but yeah it's just a pretty original

put this on there I think I it cut that
piece<00:05:41.070> of<00:05:41.130> tape<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.580> bit<00:05:41.820> too<00:05:42.090> long<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:44.690> want

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
piece of tape a bit too long so you want

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.050 
piece of tape a bit too long so you want
to<00:05:45.780> turn<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.110> down<00:05:46.140> if<00:05:46.500> that<00:05:46.680> happens<00:05:47.190> because

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
to turn it down if that happens because

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.840 
to turn it down if that happens because
you<00:05:48.330> don't<00:05:48.480> want<00:05:48.540> extra<00:05:49.290> excess<00:05:50.160> tape<00:05:50.400> game

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
you don't want extra excess tape game
