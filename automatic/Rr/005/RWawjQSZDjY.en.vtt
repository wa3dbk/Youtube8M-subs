in this next column I wanted to talk
about<00:00:05.660> warming<00:00:06.380> up<00:00:06.560> as<00:00:07.220> much<00:00:07.460> as<00:00:07.640> I<00:00:07.790> tour<00:00:08.149> I

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
about warming up as much as I tour I

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.220 
about warming up as much as I tour I
found<00:00:09.020> that<00:00:09.260> a<00:00:09.469> lot<00:00:09.710> of<00:00:09.830> times<00:00:10.100> and<00:00:10.430> especially

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
found that a lot of times and especially

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.900 
found that a lot of times and especially
when<00:00:12.230> you<00:00:12.379> fly<00:00:12.740> you<00:00:13.190> know<00:00:13.250> literally<00:00:13.580> from<00:00:13.820> the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
when you fly you know literally from the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.879 
when you fly you know literally from the
United<00:00:14.209> States<00:00:14.450> to<00:00:14.750> another<00:00:15.020> continent<00:00:15.530> you

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
United States to another continent you

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.890 
United States to another continent you
get<00:00:16.070> off<00:00:16.190> a<00:00:16.219> plane<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:16.820> I've<00:00:17.420> had<00:00:17.630> several

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
get off a plane and I've had several

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.300 
get off a plane and I've had several
times<00:00:18.289> in<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.530> last<00:00:18.619> couple<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:18.980> years<00:00:19.039> where

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
times in the last couple of years where

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.009 
times in the last couple of years where
I<00:00:19.369> literally<00:00:19.699> had<00:00:20.000> to<00:00:20.029> get<00:00:20.240> off<00:00:20.359> a<00:00:20.390> plane<00:00:20.539> and

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
I literally had to get off a plane and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.279 
I literally had to get off a plane and
perform<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.910> I<00:00:22.910> found<00:00:23.539> that<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:23.960> needed

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
perform and I found that I needed

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.490 
perform and I found that I needed
something<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:25.189> have<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:26.300> give<00:00:26.779> myself<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:27.289> good

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
something to have to give myself a good

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.769 
something to have to give myself a good
warm-up<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.789> that<00:00:28.999> I<00:00:29.029> didn't<00:00:29.359> injure<00:00:29.599> myself

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
warm-up so that I didn't injure myself

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.960 
warm-up so that I didn't injure myself
when<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.230> play<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:31.220> came<00:00:31.369> up<00:00:31.730> with<00:00:31.759> this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
when I play and so I came up with this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.420 
when I play and so I came up with this
exercise<00:00:32.450> that's<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.500> variation<00:00:34.220> on<00:00:34.340> a

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
exercise that's a variation on a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.300 
exercise that's a variation on a
familiar<00:00:35.000> theme<00:00:35.060> a<00:00:35.810> lot<00:00:36.380> of<00:00:36.530> people<00:00:36.830> use<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
familiar theme a lot of people use the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.330 
familiar theme a lot of people use the
technique<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.910> using<00:00:38.000> fingers<00:00:38.630> 12<00:00:39.050> 13<00:00:39.500> 14<00:00:40.040> in

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
technique of using fingers 12 13 14 in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.270 
technique of using fingers 12 13 14 in
just<00:00:40.700> 23<00:00:41.120> 24<00:00:41.510> 34<00:00:41.990> but<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:42.440> wanted<00:00:42.860> something

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
just 23 24 34 but I wanted something

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.490 
just 23 24 34 but I wanted something
that<00:00:43.460> was<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.850> little<00:00:43.970> more<00:00:44.300> comprehensive<00:00:45.050> so

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
that was a little more comprehensive so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.130 
that was a little more comprehensive so
I<00:00:45.530> added<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.400> all-in-one<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.570> exercise

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
I added the all-in-one to this exercise

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.370 
I added the all-in-one to this exercise
when<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:48.950> play<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:49.580> you<00:00:50.360> have<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.690> do<00:00:50.810> all<00:00:50.990> your

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
when I play this you have to do all your

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.130 
when I play this you have to do all your
fingers<00:00:51.650> at<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.100> same<00:00:52.400> time<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.900> neat

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
fingers at the same time and the neat

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.200 
fingers at the same time and the neat
thing<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:54.980> when<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.400> ascend<00:00:55.940> I'm

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
thing about this is when I ascend I'm

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
thing about this is when I ascend I'm
hammering<00:00:57.190> with<00:00:58.190> my<00:00:58.370> fretboard<00:00:58.880> hand<00:00:59.230> I'm

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
hammering with my fretboard hand I'm

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.470 
hammering with my fretboard hand I'm
alternate<00:01:01.040> picking<00:01:01.280> on<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.820> strings<00:01:02.150> I'm

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
alternate picking on the strings I'm

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.350 
alternate picking on the strings I'm
sweep<00:01:03.110> picking<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:04.159> using<00:01:04.820> hammers<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
sweep picking and using hammers and

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.720 
sweep picking and using hammers and
pulls<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.810> every<00:01:06.200> finger<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.130> exercise

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
pulls on every finger and the exercise

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:28.560 
pulls on every finger and the exercise
goes<00:01:08.180> like<00:01:08.390> this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500 

and<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.690> last<00:01:29.960> one<00:01:30.260> is<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.830> killer<00:01:31.100> uh<00:01:31.510> but

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
and that last one is the killer uh but

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.900 
and that last one is the killer uh but
what<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.869> wanted<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.470> do<00:01:33.770> on<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.340> again

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
what I wanted to do on this is again

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.450 
what I wanted to do on this is again
have<00:01:35.540> something<00:01:36.170> where<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.500> could<00:01:36.770> warm<00:01:37.310> up

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
have something where I could warm up

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.500 
have something where I could warm up
quickly<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:39.130> again<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.580> trick<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.300> is

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
quickly and again the trick to this is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.340 
quickly and again the trick to this is
to<00:01:41.990> use<00:01:42.710> every<00:01:43.670> finger<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.510> not<00:01:44.750> stop<00:01:45.140> you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
to use every finger and to not stop you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.650 
to use every finger and to not stop you
have<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.680> play<00:01:45.890> continuously<00:01:46.520> now<00:01:47.240> will<00:01:47.540> it

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
have to play continuously now will it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.990 
have to play continuously now will it
help<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.080> if<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.890> take<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.430> piece

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
help you if you if you take one piece

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.440 
help you if you if you take one piece
and<00:01:50.300> then<00:01:50.600> stop<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.440> play<00:01:52.009> another<00:01:52.280> yes<00:01:52.910> but

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
and then stop and play another yes but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.540 
and then stop and play another yes but
for<00:01:53.869> me<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.320> best<00:01:54.560> thing<00:01:54.800> is<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.040> play<00:01:55.399> it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
for me the best thing is to play it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.260 
for me the best thing is to play it
continuous<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.690> here<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.080> slow<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:58.270> start

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
continuous so here it is slow I start

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
continuous so here it is slow I start
first<00:01:59.570> by<00:01:59.810> using<00:02:00.200> my<00:02:00.500> first<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.950> second

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
first by using my first and second

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:13.660 
first by using my first and second
fingers<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:02.210> goes<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:12.190> then<00:02:13.190> i<00:02:13.220> use<00:02:13.459> my

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
fingers it goes like this then i use my

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:23.180 
fingers it goes like this then i use my
first<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.120> third<00:02:14.270> fingers

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.970 

now<00:02:24.190> notice<00:02:24.490> alternate<00:02:25.210> picking<00:02:25.420> up<00:02:25.980> sweet

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

picking down and two and three and two
and<00:02:48.370> four<00:02:57.570> now<00:02:58.570> notice<00:02:58.840> soon<00:02:59.170> when<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.320> get<00:02:59.560> to

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
and four now notice soon when I get to

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.460

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
again it's one other technique that I

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.050 
again it's one other technique that I
incorporate<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.739> that's<00:03:05.920> one<00:03:06.130> exercise<00:03:06.520> now

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
incorporate and that's one exercise now

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.479 
incorporate and that's one exercise now
fingers<00:03:07.390> three<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:07.989> four<00:03:17.010> now<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.070> killer

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
fingers three and four now the killer

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.970 
fingers three and four now the killer
fingers<00:03:19.360> two<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.810> three<00:03:20.080> spread<00:03:20.530> over<00:03:20.650> two

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
fingers two and three spread over two

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.750 
fingers two and three spread over two
frets

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
frets

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:34.869 
frets
I<00:03:31.629> start<00:03:32.629> with<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.040> exercise<00:03:34.040> on<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.640> 5th

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
I start with this exercise on the 5th

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.940 
I start with this exercise on the 5th
fret<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.629> eighth<00:03:35.750> position<00:03:35.959> why<00:03:36.530> because

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
fret in the eighth position why because

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.699 
fret in the eighth position why because
it's<00:03:37.129> comfortable<00:03:37.310> because<00:03:37.819> it's<00:03:38.150> kind<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
it's comfortable because it's kind of a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.800 
it's comfortable because it's kind of a
place<00:03:39.709> where<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.190> it's<00:03:40.610> not<00:03:40.879> too<00:03:41.120> close<00:03:41.390> as

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
place where it's it's not too close as

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.509 
place where it's it's not too close as
far<00:03:42.079> as<00:03:42.140> foot<00:03:42.409> spacing<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.099> not<00:03:43.250> too

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
far as foot spacing and it's not too

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.569 
far as foot spacing and it's not too
wide<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.420> also<00:03:44.799> move<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:46.040> exercise

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
wide but I also move this exercise

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.759 
wide but I also move this exercise
around<00:03:46.909> when<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.120> play<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.599> first<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.230> start<00:03:48.680> in

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
around when I play it first I start in

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.339 
around when I play it first I start in
the<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> position<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.060> i<00:03:50.090> also<00:03:50.569> like<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.049> move

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
the a position but i also like to move

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.899 
the a position but i also like to move
it<00:03:51.500> down<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.980> 1st<00:03:52.250> fret<00:03:52.489> because<00:03:52.640> it

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
it down to the 1st fret because it

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.630 
it down to the 1st fret because it
creates<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.390> better<00:03:54.129> warm<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.519> a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
creates a better warm up and it's a

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.550 
creates a better warm up and it's a
little<00:03:55.790> more<00:03:56.030> challenging<00:03:56.659> when<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.170> play<00:03:57.440> it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
little more challenging when you play it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:18.189 
little more challenging when you play it
low<00:03:57.829> for<00:03:58.340> example<00:03:58.819> like<00:03:58.940> this<00:04:17.169> now<00:04:18.169> I

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
low for example like this now I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.900 
low for example like this now I
recommend<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.039> play<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.579> in<00:04:19.789> every

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
recommend that you play this in every

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.360 
recommend that you play this in every
position<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.690> you're<00:04:21.109> going<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.470> find<00:04:21.769> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
position and you're going to find you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.010 
position and you're going to find you
know<00:04:22.460> from<00:04:22.699> playing<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.060> low<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.600> then<00:04:23.780> moving

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
know from playing it low and then moving

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.050 
know from playing it low and then moving
it<00:04:24.229> up<00:04:24.320> high<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.590> especially<00:04:24.979> higher<00:04:25.460> you're

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
it up high and especially higher you're

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.670 
it up high and especially higher you're
going<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.389> find<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.289> a<00:04:27.380> little

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
going to find that it's a little

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.230 
going to find that it's a little
different<00:04:27.949> movement<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.789> your<00:04:28.910> fingers

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
different movement of your fingers

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510 
different movement of your fingers
especially<00:04:29.900> when<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.169> do<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.979> two

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
especially when you do that the two

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.250 
especially when you do that the two
frets<00:04:31.849> spacing<00:04:32.419> with<00:04:32.630> your<00:04:32.810> second<00:04:33.139> and<00:04:33.199> third

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
frets spacing with your second and third

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.159 
frets spacing with your second and third
finger<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.680> find<00:04:34.039> when<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.490> play<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:34.940> low<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.510> have

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
finger I find when I play it low I have

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.260 
finger I find when I play it low I have
to<00:04:36.320> move<00:04:36.530> almost<00:04:36.860> my<00:04:37.099> index<00:04:37.460> finger<00:04:37.550> up<00:04:37.940> when

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
to move almost my index finger up when

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.300 
to move almost my index finger up when
you<00:04:38.360> get<00:04:38.479> higher<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.710> frets<00:04:39.979> are<00:04:40.130> so

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
you get higher this the frets are so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.310 
you get higher this the frets are so
much<00:04:40.490> closer<00:04:40.789> you<00:04:41.090> don't<00:04:41.330> need<00:04:41.539> to<00:04:41.750> do<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:41.960> to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
much closer you don't need to do that to

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.830 
much closer you don't need to do that to
get<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.500> reach<00:04:43.120> I'm<00:04:44.120> going<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.360> play<00:04:44.599> it<00:04:44.750> on

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
get the reach I'm going to play it on

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.680 
get the reach I'm going to play it on
the<00:04:44.870> 17th<00:04:45.560> fret<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.099> i'm<00:04:46.220> going<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.400> show<00:04:46.610> you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
the 17th fret and i'm going to show you

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.920 
the 17th fret and i'm going to show you
what<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.780> sounds<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.470> looks<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.639> to<00:04:50.539> play<00:04:50.780> at

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
what it sounds and looks like to play at

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.600 
what it sounds and looks like to play at
this<00:04:51.080> high<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:51.620> here's<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.979> same<00:04:52.220> exact

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
this high so here's the same exact

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.300 
this high so here's the same exact
exercise
