00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:10.740

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 went on a dihedral fear of reindeer 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 left on the bardo by Santa Claus 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.140
 well what can wear shocks 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.330
 go down to the wire not to 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 to have the sting that is not so good 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.119
 said it's called departure okay you 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.530
 and red eyes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.530
 the opposite you really feel that you are 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 in the spirit of facts then you will be 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.480
 is not it so they do not see the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.129
 young people learn that I have been hired 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 as Santa Claus in a mall 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.079
 you should see with the black beard 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.430
 curly if she stays in my suit of 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:06.540
 mauve and yellow Santa Claus in colors 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 delay that I do it so allows overdue 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.390
 get overfishing this post July 10 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.390
 Bern would have taken your hand but easy 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.939
 no because I have extracts 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 reassuring storm but announces 10 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.320
 August to week knew that I had 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.030
 come this post of Santa Claus do you think 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.690
 work I was against the Chinese 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 a man in a wheelchair theme women 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.860
 repairs 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.340
 those moments but eventually I got the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.500
 job 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 I love my job of course and 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.430
 besides I make you hear a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.640
 excerpt from my day yesterday we are 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640
 happy 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.760
 but the task will of course be the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.760
