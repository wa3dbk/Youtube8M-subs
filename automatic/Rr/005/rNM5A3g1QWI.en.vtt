00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.180
 his cruiser putuni hometown is one thousand 600 kilometers from where I live 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.060
 currently and I have a two-year-old son 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 driving can be very tired if the stupid car are very comfortable 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 the civic has been criticized for being too loud in the past 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.810
 the car has to be silent and comfortable if it is to offer value to 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.370
 our customers and you have to maintain high quality speeds 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.080
 according to a fire on English roads we noticed a lot of noise in the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 interior despite the high level of insulation 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.250
 that's why we use a neko room and they drop an ounce in their introduction to analyze and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.020
 optimize the performance of this isolation quantum euros 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.090
 the new edition 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.590
 min we do not improve the noise and refinement of the new civic 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.840
 only through a letter 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 it was the accumulation of many small details 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.979
 for example we observe the material and the design of the roof covering and 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.450
 how it joins with the body quantum 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 his world record we spend a lot of time reducing fluids and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.940
 engine vibrations and tt 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.159
 we modify the injection system 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.759
 and we change internal parts to reduce weight and friction 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 now we have a very refined engine 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.370
 occupies the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.850
 cuckoo very much emphasis on aerodynamics and we are very proud 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.680
 to have achieved the best value in its category to improve aerodynamics 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.930
 it only offers advantages not only the improvement of fuel consumption 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.300
 performance also improves refinement by reducing noise 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.809
 air inside the passenger compartment 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.819
 We did a lot of testing in the wind tunnel to optimize each line and 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.489
 surface of the car 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.310
 some of our technicians have worked on formula 1 and are 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.680
 experts in combining aerodynamic efficiency with high stability 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.819
 speeds his knowledge contributed to get a great 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.479
 result 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:43.089
 my great challenge was to overcome the noise and vibration levels of our 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:47.859
 European competitors I am very proud to have achieved our 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 objectives
