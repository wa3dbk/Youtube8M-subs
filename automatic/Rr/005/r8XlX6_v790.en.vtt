thought people was dumb deaf and stupid

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.260 
thought people was dumb deaf and stupid
I<00:03:20.040> guess<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.520> they<00:03:20.670> wasn't<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.120> check

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
I guess that they wasn't going to check

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.050 
I guess that they wasn't going to check
the<00:03:21.420> analytics<00:03:22.080> that's<00:03:22.890> why<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the analytics that's why it is the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.790 
the analytics that's why it is the
hashtag<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:24.690> out<00:03:24.780> their<00:03:24.930> team<00:03:25.200> analytics

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
hashtag going out their team analytics

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.620 
hashtag going out their team analytics
so<00:03:25.950> when<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.190> comes<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.460> nicks<00:03:26.670> because<00:03:27.000> yeah

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
