air this gives me the opportunity to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830 
air this gives me the opportunity to
affect<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.679> timing<00:01:39.249> with<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.119> trigger<00:01:40.479> smart

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
affect the timing with the trigger smart

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.830 
affect the timing with the trigger smart
system<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.969> let's<00:01:42.969> get<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.209> lighting<00:01:43.600> right

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
system and let's get the lighting right

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.480 
system and let's get the lighting right
and<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.200> focusing<00:01:44.799> obviously<00:01:45.189> once<00:01:45.369> the

that<00:01:48.909> position<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.779> I<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.560> just<00:01:50.590> leave<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.130> as

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279 
that position and I can just leave it as

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:55.800 
that position and I can just leave it as
it<00:01:51.459> is<00:01:53.759> hopefully<00:01:54.759> all<00:01:54.999> will<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.389> going<00:01:55.569> well

neglected to mention earlier obviously
working<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.880> liquid<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.310> good<00:02:38.460> idea

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
working with liquid so it's a good idea

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.470
