we're learning a waving combination and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.609 
we're learning a waving combination and
this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.960> sweet<00:00:22.230> because<00:00:22.470> it's

this is going to be sweet because it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
this is going to be sweet because it's
going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> ball<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.220> isolation<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.449> body

gonna be awesome

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.929 
gonna be awesome
let's<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.439> started<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.890> check<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.730> just

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
let's get started I check this up just

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
let's get started I check this up just
try<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.359> move<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> start<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
try this move I'm going to start in a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
try this move I'm going to start in a
back<00:00:32.219> position<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:33.840> arm

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
back position I'm going to make my arm

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200 
back position I'm going to make my arm
with<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
with go this way I'm going to kind of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.470 
with go this way I'm going to kind of
isolate<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.960> arm<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.760> channel

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
isolate my arm as if this little channel

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
isolate my arm as if this little channel
right<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> wavelength<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
right here is like a wavelength that my

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
right here is like a wavelength that my
body<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.750> through<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
body has to go through with this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.360 
body has to go through with this
electron<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.739> it's<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.920> there's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
electron see that so it's like there's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
electron see that so it's like there's
our<00:00:47.640> point<00:00:47.969> right<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.870> where<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> wave<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
our point right here where the wave is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
our point right here where the wave is
moving<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.430> no<00:00:50.700> matter<00:00:50.850> where<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:52.110> long

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
moving and no matter where I go as long

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
moving and no matter where I go as long
as<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> point<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> wave

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
as it's this point that's where the wave

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.830 
as it's this point that's where the wave
is<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.870> body<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.690> going

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is in my body right now it's not going

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
is in my body right now it's not going
to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.989> spot<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> concept<00:00:59.879> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to be spot on but this is the concept of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630 
to be spot on but this is the concept of
permanent<00:01:00.300> isolated<00:01:01.140> weight<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.129> opposed<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
permanent isolated weight as opposed to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.260 
permanent isolated weight as opposed to
doing<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.650> I'm<00:01:04.650> moving<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> center

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
doing this I'm I'm moving at the center

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.289 
doing this I'm I'm moving at the center
point<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.840> focal<00:01:07.229> point<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.310> weight<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
point a focal point or my weight is so I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
point a focal point or my weight is so I
got<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.790> coming

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
got to go here and then I'm coming

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
got to go here and then I'm coming
around<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:13.130> now<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> right

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
around this way now when I get to right

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
around this way now when I get to right
here<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.869> where<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
here this is where I'm going to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
here this is where I'm going to
continuous<00:01:17.130> move<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.909> whole<00:01:18.180> wave<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.960> I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
continuous move that whole wave and I'm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
continuous move that whole wave and I'm
going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:19.890> focal<00:01:20.369> point<00:01:20.580> until

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
going to take that now focal point until

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.219 
going to take that now focal point until
like<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.060> grabbing<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like I'm grabbing it and I'm going to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.280 
like I'm grabbing it and I'm going to
make<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.530> body<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.689> synced<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
make my body go up just to synced up and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
make my body go up just to synced up and
kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> linked<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:25.979> angle<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
kind of linked to an angle I'm going to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.469 
kind of linked to an angle I'm going to
move<00:01:27.000> down

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
move down

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
move down
just<00:01:27.960> sinks<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.890> pump<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> goes<00:01:29.430> forward<00:01:29.820> like

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just sinks my pump it goes forward like

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.179 
just sinks my pump it goes forward like
that<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.659> butt<00:01:30.930> sinks<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that and my butt sinks and I'm going to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
that and my butt sinks and I'm going to
kick<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:33.180> foot<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.140> foot<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
kick out my right foot my right foot so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
kick out my right foot my right foot so
I'm<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.799> doing<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.640> goes<00:01:35.759> without<00:01:35.880> end

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
I'm just doing that it goes without end

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.800 
I'm just doing that it goes without end
left<00:01:37.140> foot

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
left foot

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.399 
left foot
and<00:01:37.930> right<00:01:38.860> foot<00:01:39.130> back<00:01:39.280> out<00:01:39.909> coming<00:01:40.479> up<00:01:40.600> sink

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
and right foot back out coming up sink

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.940 
and right foot back out coming up sink
again<00:01:41.530> with<00:01:42.100> your<00:01:42.610> center<00:01:42.970> chest<00:01:43.720> left<00:01:44.710> I'm

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
again with your center chest left I'm

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.420 
again with your center chest left I'm
here<00:01:45.250> really<00:01:46.000> slow<00:01:46.330> or<00:01:46.600> not<00:01:46.780> I'm<00:01:47.320> going<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:48.190> my

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
here really slow or not I'm going in my
