until<00:00:25.279> you've<00:00:25.670> got<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.820> nice<00:00:26.180> pointy<00:00:26.810> cone

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
until you've got a nice pointy cone

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.820 
until you've got a nice pointy cone
shape<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.310> same<00:00:28.490> with<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.760> big<00:00:28.910> one

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830

there<00:00:30.830> we<00:00:30.949> have<00:00:31.100> two<00:00:31.490> Christmas<00:00:31.880> tree<00:00:32.090> shapes

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
there we have two Christmas tree shapes

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.799 
there we have two Christmas tree shapes
now<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:33.770> need<00:00:34.070> your<00:00:34.190> modelling<00:00:34.609> tool<00:00:34.879> and

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
now you need your modelling tool and

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.180 
now you need your modelling tool and
we're<00:00:35.929> gonna<00:00:36.050> stick<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.440> tool<00:00:36.649> into<00:00:36.979> the<00:00:37.010> end

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
we're gonna stick the tool into the end

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.680 
we're gonna stick the tool into the end
of<00:00:37.370> there<00:00:37.550> don't<00:00:37.999> worry<00:00:38.149> if<00:00:38.300> you're<00:00:38.420> not<00:00:38.449> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
of there don't worry if you're not the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.849 
of there don't worry if you're not the
top<00:00:38.839> of<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.050> tree<00:00:39.260> like<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:39.620> just

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
top of the tree like that just

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.680 
top of the tree like that just
straighten<00:00:40.249> it<00:00:40.339> up<00:00:40.460> again<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.269> we<00:00:41.510> need<00:00:41.659> a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
straighten it up again and we need a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.009 
straighten it up again and we need a
pair<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:41.989> nail<00:00:42.260> scissors<00:00:43.179> now<00:00:44.179> the<00:00:44.239> angle<00:00:44.809> that

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
pair of nail scissors now the angle that

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.779 
pair of nail scissors now the angle that
you<00:00:45.139> must<00:00:45.319> hold<00:00:45.530> your<00:00:45.710> scissors<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.399> tree

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
you must hold your scissors to the tree

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.779 
you must hold your scissors to the tree
is<00:00:47.329> resting<00:00:48.229> on<00:00:48.409> the<00:00:48.559> slope<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:49.339> must<00:00:49.519> never

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
is resting on the slope you must never

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.090 
is resting on the slope you must never
ever<00:00:49.969> stick<00:00:50.449> them<00:00:50.659> in<00:00:50.809> at<00:00:51.319> that<00:00:51.499> angle<00:00:51.769> because

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
ever stick them in at that angle because

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.619 
ever stick them in at that angle because
that<00:00:52.219> just<00:00:52.370> makes<00:00:52.609> little<00:00:52.760> sharp<00:00:53.089> cuts<00:00:53.389> not

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
that just makes little sharp cuts not

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.930 
that just makes little sharp cuts not
branches<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.859> open<00:00:55.159> your<00:00:55.249> scissors<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.609> little

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
branches so open your scissors a little

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.329 
branches so open your scissors a little
bit<00:00:56.260> rest<00:00:57.260> them<00:00:57.469> against<00:00:57.709> the<00:00:57.889> side<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.280> the

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
bit rest them against the side of the

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.349 
bit rest them against the side of the
tree<00:00:58.639> and<00:00:58.879> snip<00:01:00.489> now<00:01:01.489> if<00:01:01.609> you've<00:01:01.760> got<00:01:01.789> various

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
tree and snip now if you've got various

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.969 
tree and snip now if you've got various
different<00:01:02.420> nails<00:01:02.959> sisters<00:01:03.319> at<00:01:03.469> home<00:01:03.619> have<00:01:03.949> a

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
different nails sisters at home have a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.229 
different nails sisters at home have a
go<00:01:04.159> with<00:01:04.309> all<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.610> them<00:01:04.760> because<00:01:04.940> what<00:01:05.089> you'll

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
go with all of them because what you'll

go with all of them because what you'll
find<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.810> some<00:01:06.500> scissors<00:01:06.890> will<00:01:07.070> suit<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.460> more

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
find is some scissors will suit you more

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.680 
find is some scissors will suit you more
than<00:01:07.760> others<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.940> get<00:01:11.090> further<00:01:11.330> down

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
than others and as you get further down

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.890 
than others and as you get further down
I<00:01:12.050> open<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> scissors<00:01:13.280> more<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:14.480> makes<00:01:14.780> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
I open the scissors more it makes a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.660 
I open the scissors more it makes a
bigger<00:01:15.080> branch<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:19.130> when<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.580> the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
bigger branch and when we get to the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.960 
bigger branch and when we get to the
bottom<00:01:19.820> I'm<00:01:20.210> really<00:01:20.690> opening<00:01:20.960> them<00:01:21.110> very<00:01:21.380> wide

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
bottom I'm really opening them very wide

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.950 
bottom I'm really opening them very wide
and<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.120> get<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.570> huge<00:01:24.500> right<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.630> there's<00:01:26.780> one

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and we get a huge right and there's one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.720 
and we get a huge right and there's one
twist<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.740> remove<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.190> if<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:28.490> try

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
twist it to remove it if you just try

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.760 
twist it to remove it if you just try
and<00:01:28.760> pull<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.030> off<00:01:29.180> your<00:01:29.420> distort<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:30.500> just

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770

and pull it off your distort it but just
twist<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.220> off<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.580> tool<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.990> will<00:01:33.050> come<00:01:33.260> off

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
twist it off the tool it will come off

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.560 
twist it off the tool it will come off
easily<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:34.610> next<00:01:34.940> tree<00:01:35.150> I'll<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:35.390> show<00:01:35.540> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.650 

now<00:01:57.280> you've<00:01:57.430> got<00:01:57.550> two<00:01:57.730> little<00:01:57.910> trees<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:58.510> this

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
now you've got two little trees now this
