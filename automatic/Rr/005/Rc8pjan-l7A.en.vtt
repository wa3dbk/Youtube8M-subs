00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.300 
so imagine us flying over the Rocky
Mountains<00:00:42.530> right<00:00:42.770> now<00:00:42.950> when<00:00:43.160> you're<00:00:43.250> looking

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
Mountains right now when you're looking

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.220 
Mountains right now when you're looking
down<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.060> you<00:00:44.180> can<00:00:44.330> see<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.780> peaks<00:00:45.020> and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
down and you can see the peaks and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.080 
down and you can see the peaks and
valleys<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.340> what<00:00:46.490> your<00:00:46.610> windshield

valleys that is what your windshield
looks<00:00:47.480> like<00:00:47.780> underneath<00:00:48.520> magnification<00:00:49.520> a

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
looks like underneath magnification a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.790 
looks like underneath magnification a
lot<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.910> people<00:00:50.180> don't<00:00:50.390> know<00:00:50.540> that<00:00:50.570> when<00:00:51.560> you

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
lot of people don't know that when you

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.310 
lot of people don't know that when you
get<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.430> rock<00:00:52.670> chip<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.330> is<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.660> rock<00:00:53.960> hitting

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
get a rock chip it is a rock hitting

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.900 
get a rock chip it is a rock hitting
that<00:00:54.590> peak<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.190> they'll<00:00:55.340> pop<00:00:55.550> them<00:00:55.730> out<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
that peak so they'll pop them out and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.500 
that peak so they'll pop them out and
just<00:00:56.000> fall<00:00:56.210> right<00:00:56.240> off

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
just fall right off

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.260 
just fall right off
that's<00:00:56.810> what<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> rock<00:00:57.290> chip<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:58.030> by<00:00:59.030> putting

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
that's what a rock chip is by putting

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.420 
that's what a rock chip is by putting
the<00:00:59.450> diamond<00:00:59.780> Fusion<00:01:00.200> over<00:01:00.470> top<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.220> glass

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the diamond Fusion over top of the glass

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.280 
the diamond Fusion over top of the glass
we're<00:01:01.730> filling<00:01:02.150> in<00:01:02.270> those<00:01:02.480> peaks<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.230> valleys

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
we're filling in those peaks and valleys

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.679 
we're filling in those peaks and valleys
so<00:01:03.740> it's<00:01:03.920> becoming<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.610> smooth<00:01:04.909> flat<00:01:05.210> surface

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
so it's becoming a smooth flat surface

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.450 
so it's becoming a smooth flat surface
then<00:01:06.320> we're<00:01:06.470> putting<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.920> second<00:01:07.280> stage

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
then we're putting the second stage

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.820 
then we're putting the second stage
overtop<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.090> which<00:01:08.240> caps<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.960> makes<00:01:09.680> it

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
overtop of it which caps it and makes it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.030 
overtop of it which caps it and makes it
slick<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.330> when<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:11.630> rains<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.380> don't<00:01:12.860> need<00:01:12.980> to

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
slick so when it rains I don't need to

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.500 
slick so when it rains I don't need to
turn<00:01:13.190> my<00:01:13.310> windshield<00:01:13.520> wiper<00:01:13.670> blades<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
turn my windshield wiper blades on it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.230 
turn my windshield wiper blades on it
goes<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:15.230> this<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:16.010> just<00:01:16.090> feeds<00:01:17.090> right

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
goes like this and it just feeds right

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.930 
goes like this and it just feeds right
up<00:01:17.540> no<00:01:18.020> problems<00:01:18.470> if<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.310> rock<00:01:19.490> hits<00:01:19.730> my

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
up no problems if a rock hits my

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.440 
up no problems if a rock hits my
windshield

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
windshield

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.220 
windshield
I<00:01:20.890> may<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> rock<00:01:22.760> chip<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.750> likelihood

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
I may get a rock chip but the likelihood

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.600 
I may get a rock chip but the likelihood
of<00:01:24.260> that<00:01:24.380> actually<00:01:24.830> happening<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.370> pretty

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
of that actually happening is pretty

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.130 
of that actually happening is pretty
slim<00:01:25.940> because<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> diamond<00:01:26.840> fusion

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
slim because with the diamond fusion

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.380 
slim because with the diamond fusion
product<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.680> even<00:01:28.400> creases<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> strength<00:01:29.240> of

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
product it even creases the strength of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.660 
product it even creases the strength of
the<00:01:29.510> windshield<00:01:29.870> by<00:01:30.020> up<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.170> 10<00:01:30.470> times<00:01:30.740> because

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
the windshield by up to 10 times because

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.520 
the windshield by up to 10 times because
of<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.150> process<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:32.900> just<00:01:32.990> talked<00:01:33.440> to
