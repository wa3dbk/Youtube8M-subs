looking at this section of this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
looking at this section of this
cinematic<00:01:09.630> where<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.080> underground<00:01:10.380> maybe

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
cinematic where we're underground maybe

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.910 
cinematic where we're underground maybe
there<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.820> weapons<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.920> underground

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there are weapons that are underground

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
there are weapons that are underground
maybe<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.729> sort<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> shovel<00:01:15.810> from

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
maybe you get some sort of shovel from

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
maybe you get some sort of shovel from
the<00:01:16.860> box<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> does<00:01:17.430> sound<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.729> far-fetched

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the box it does sound a bit far-fetched

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
the box it does sound a bit far-fetched
or<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:19.020> sort<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> attachment<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> gun

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
or some sort of attachment on a gun

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
or some sort of attachment on a gun
which<00:01:20.549> lets<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.119> dig<00:01:21.390> weapons<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.350> really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
which lets you dig weapons up I'm really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
which lets you dig weapons up I'm really
not<00:01:22.770> sure<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.240> interesting<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> we

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
not sure but that's interesting that we

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.710 
not sure but that's interesting that we
can<00:01:25.430> share<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> weapon<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:26.970> we've<00:01:27.210> dug<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.600> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can share a weapon that we've dug up so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
can share a weapon that we've dug up so
I'm<00:01:27.780> guessing<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> find<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> weapon<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I'm guessing you find the weapon and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm guessing you find the weapon and
then<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.119> somehow<00:01:30.390> place<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.259> something

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
then you somehow place it in something

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260 
then you somehow place it in something
so<00:01:31.770> someone<00:01:32.070> else<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.090> too

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so someone else can get it I'm not too

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
so someone else can get it I'm not too
sure<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.290> next<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.909> base<00:01:36.119> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sure the next one is all your base in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.140 
sure the next one is all your base in

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
saw like a look at these weird kind of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
saw like a look at these weird kind of
pillars<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.880> aligned<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
pillars that are all like aligned in a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.719 
pillars that are all like aligned in a
shape<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> saw<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.189> well<00:01:50.399> when

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
shape and you saw it as well when

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
shape and you saw it as well when
underground<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.640> medieval

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
underground in that where that medieval

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
underground in that where that medieval
zombie<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.020> guessing<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.560> what

zombie was but I'm guessing that's what
the<00:01:55.950> generator<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.460> all<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:56.820> too<00:01:56.969> sure

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the generator is all I'm not too sure

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
the generator is all I'm not too sure
what<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.630> maybe<00:01:58.079> they're<00:01:58.350> Easter<00:01:58.979> Egg

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
what they do maybe they're Easter Egg

what they do maybe they're Easter Egg
related<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.119> part<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.390> something<00:02:00.869> that

maybe they pack a punch or something I'm

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.959 
maybe they pack a punch or something I'm
not<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.149> sure<00:02:03.390> next<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> kung<00:02:04.979> fu<00:02:05.009> grip<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
not too sure next one is kung fu grip in

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.719 
not too sure next one is kung fu grip in

as<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.350> one<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> arms<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> could

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
as you know one of the arms for it could

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.100 
as you know one of the arms for it could
be<00:02:15.610> his<00:02:15.700> claw<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.120> likes<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.360> stamp<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:16.930> it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
be his claw it likes to stamp down it

likes<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.440> grab<00:02:17.680> stuff<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.970> robot<00:02:19.570> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
likes to grab stuff so the robot is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.740 
likes to grab stuff so the robot is
called<00:02:20.230> pants<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.860> solder<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.610> hopefully<00:02:22.510> it's

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
called pants a solder and hopefully it's

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.110 
called pants a solder and hopefully it's
not<00:02:22.930> too<00:02:22.990> difficult<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.620> free<00:02:23.890> yourself<00:02:24.340> but

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
not too difficult to free yourself but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180 
not too difficult to free yourself but
for<00:02:25.480> yourself<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.990> another<00:02:26.410> okay

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
for yourself and another okay

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.640 
for yourself and another okay
interesting<00:02:27.940> next<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.810> playing<00:02:29.440> with

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
interesting next one is playing with

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.160 
interesting next one is playing with
power<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:30.130> origins<00:02:31.000> build<00:02:31.360> all<00:02:31.600> other

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
power in origins build all other

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.550 
power in origins build all other
elemental<00:02:32.620> staffs<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.370> one<00:02:33.730> game<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:35.350> is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
elemental staffs in one game now this is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.360 
elemental staffs in one game now this is
weird

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
weird

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.330 
weird
okay<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.080> building<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.380> sounds<00:02:38.770> like<00:02:38.920> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
okay so building so that sounds like you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
okay so building so that sounds like you
know<00:02:39.490> we<00:02:39.670> need<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.970> crafting<00:02:40.480> tables<00:02:41.470> to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
know we need the crafting tables to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.320 
know we need the crafting tables to
build<00:02:41.860> stuff<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.430> staffs<00:02:43.150> sound<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.930> what

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
build stuff and staffs sound like what

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.400 
build stuff and staffs sound like what
Gandalf<00:02:46.330> would<00:02:46.630> use<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.930> know<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.170> Lord<00:02:47.320> of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
Gandalf would use you know in Lord of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.110 
Gandalf would use you know in Lord of
the<00:02:47.470> Rings<00:02:47.530> where<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.010> has<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> big<00:02:48.430> stuff<00:02:48.790> I'm

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the Rings where it has the big stuff I'm

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.750 
the Rings where it has the big stuff I'm
guessing<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:49.810> what<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.770> building

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
guessing that's what it is but building

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.480 
guessing that's what it is but building
multiple<00:02:52.270> staffs<00:02:53.020> that's<00:02:53.470> interesting<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
multiple staffs that's interesting and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.640 
multiple staffs that's interesting and
I'm<00:02:54.790> not<00:02:55.090> too<00:02:55.270> sure<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:56.140> could<00:02:56.380> do<00:02:56.620> I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
I'm not too sure what they could do I

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.580 
I'm not too sure what they could do I
mean<00:02:57.070> do<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.540> really<00:02:58.930> don't<00:02:59.170> know<00:02:59.440> but

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
mean do you like I really don't know but

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.140 
mean do you like I really don't know but
if<00:02:59.710> you've<00:02:59.830> got<00:02:59.860> any<00:03:00.100> ideas<00:03:00.190> be<00:03:00.700> sure<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.970> pop

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
if you've got any ideas be sure to pop

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.970 
if you've got any ideas be sure to pop
them<00:03:01.270> down<00:03:01.330> below<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.930> comment<00:03:02.560> section

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
them down below in the comment section

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760 
them down below in the comment section
the<00:03:03.280> next<00:03:03.520> one<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.880> I'm<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> tank<00:03:04.870> in<00:03:05.110> origins

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
the next one is I'm on a tank in origins

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.590 
the next one is I'm on a tank in origins
ride<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> tank<00:03:06.670> around<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.120> map<00:03:07.300> without

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
ride the tank around the map without

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.540 
ride the tank around the map without
getting<00:03:07.960> off<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.710> this<00:03:08.860> sounds<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.310> pretty

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
getting off so this sounds like a pretty

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.580 
getting off so this sounds like a pretty
easy<00:03:09.690> achievement<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.110> about<00:03:11.260> how

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
easy achievement if you think about how

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.590 
easy achievement if you think about how
in<00:03:11.860> transit<00:03:12.400> we<00:03:12.580> did<00:03:12.760> we<00:03:13.000> could<00:03:13.210> kind<00:03:13.480> of

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
in transit we did we could kind of

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.050 
in transit we did we could kind of
survive<00:03:13.870> without<00:03:14.280> leaving<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.520> bus<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.910> mean

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
survive without leaving the bus I mean

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060 
survive without leaving the bus I mean
it<00:03:16.150> depends<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.690> really<00:03:16.990> wanted<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> go

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
it depends if you really wanted to go

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.170 
it depends if you really wanted to go
and<00:03:18.190> get<00:03:18.340> anything<00:03:18.640> I'm<00:03:18.730> not<00:03:18.880> too<00:03:19.000> sure<00:03:19.150> if

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
and get anything I'm not too sure if

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.520 
and get anything I'm not too sure if
it's<00:03:19.330> gonna<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.600> similar<00:03:19.960> layout<00:03:20.170> in

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's gonna be a similar layout in

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.310 
it's gonna be a similar layout in
origins<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.520> transit<00:03:22.210> wasn't<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.660> great

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
origins you know transit wasn't a great

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.830 
origins you know transit wasn't a great
map<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.040> hope<00:03:24.460> not<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.300> shouldn't<00:03:25.810> be

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
map so I hope not but it shouldn't be

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.870 
map so I hope not but it shouldn't be
too<00:03:26.020> difficult

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
too difficult

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.390 
too difficult
saving<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.030> day<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.960> day<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.530> origins

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
saving the day all day in origins

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.250 
saving the day all day in origins

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
ways in one game this is interesting

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.480 
ways in one game this is interesting

revival right now there's you know going
up<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.710> player<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.190> reviving<00:03:40.150> them<00:03:40.330> or<00:03:40.620> by

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
up to the player and reviving them or by

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.990 
up to the player and reviving them or by
shooting<00:03:42.010> them<00:03:42.160> with<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.340> ballistic<00:03:42.850> knife

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
shooting them with a ballistic knife

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.800 
shooting them with a ballistic knife
which<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.450> Packer<00:03:44.020> punched<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.970> don't<00:03:46.630> know

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
which is Packer punched so I don't know

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.230 
which is Packer punched so I don't know
how<00:03:47.200> exactly<00:03:47.640> they'll<00:03:48.640> do<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
how exactly they'll do that but this

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.670 
how exactly they'll do that but this
next<00:03:49.510> achievement<00:03:49.570> kind<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.170> goes<00:03:50.350> into<00:03:50.650> a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
next achievement kind of goes into a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
next achievement kind of goes into a
little<00:03:50.830> bit<00:03:51.010> more<00:03:51.040> master<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.030> disguise<00:03:52.450> in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
little bit more master of disguise in

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.440 
little bit more master of disguise in
origins<00:03:53.500> use<00:03:53.980> zombie<00:03:54.400> blood<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.820> revive<00:03:55.150> free

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
origins use zombie blood to revive free

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.540 
origins use zombie blood to revive free
players<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.050> activate<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> generator<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.280> one

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
players and activate a generator in one

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.940 
players and activate a generator in one
game<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.660> my<00:03:58.810> mind<00:03:59.080> I<00:03:59.320> thought<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.800> was<00:03:59.920> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
game so in my mind I thought that was a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.890 
game so in my mind I thought that was a
turned<00:04:00.280> achievement<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:00.970> I'm<00:04:01.270> thinking<00:04:01.720> if

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
turned achievement but I'm thinking if

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.860 
turned achievement but I'm thinking if
you<00:04:02.260> use<00:04:02.620> zombie<00:04:03.040> blood<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.459> may<00:04:03.940> disguise<00:04:04.510> you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
you use zombie blood it may disguise you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.810 
you use zombie blood it may disguise you
so<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.350> zombies<00:04:05.709> think<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.190> are<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.490> zombie

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
so the zombies think you are a zombie

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.030 
so the zombies think you are a zombie
and<00:04:07.270> then<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.690> go<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:07.990> revive<00:04:08.350> that's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
and then you can go and revive that's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.420 
and then you can go and revive that's
just<00:04:09.370> my<00:04:10.300> interpretation<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.950> but<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.250> not

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
just my interpretation of it but I'm not

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.080 
just my interpretation of it but I'm not
too<00:04:12.580> sure<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.720> next<00:04:14.020> one<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.790> overachiever<00:04:15.790> in

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
too sure the next one is overachiever in

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.270 
too sure the next one is overachiever in
origins<00:04:16.690> complete<00:04:17.109> all<00:04:17.260> four<00:04:17.530> challenges<00:04:18.100> in

origins complete all four challenges in
one<00:04:18.489> game<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:20.470> sounds<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:20.830> within<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
one game so it sounds like within the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.510 
one game so it sounds like within the
map<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:21.549> get<00:04:21.760> these<00:04:21.970> four<00:04:22.270> challenges<00:04:22.840> which

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
map we get these four challenges which

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.280 
map we get these four challenges which
you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.790> complete<00:04:25.450> I'm<00:04:25.630> not<00:04:25.780> sure<00:04:25.990> if<00:04:26.110> they're

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
you can complete I'm not sure if they're

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.420 
you can complete I'm not sure if they're
