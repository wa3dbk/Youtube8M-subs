00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.080
 hi my name is maxim and what are you in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 The moment you look is called not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 overview 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.809
 March 15 at the opening of the arena took place 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.509
 Burley between Spartak and Dynamo and after 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 According to Anton Shunina will immediately start I 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.840
 Again, I repeat that you hope good luck 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.039
 today we will be accompanied by that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.600
 now is the time to win that's great 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 can learn ask arc again work time 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.439
 space is dangerous let's say so we 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:46.980
 there is a favor from last game perry 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:48.809
 Spartak and we today must before the war and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.789
 it is the voice of hunger Spartak won 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.829
 the second win of this season is laden and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.980
 Incidentally, this is the fourth victory 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.170
 in a row blue white but go back a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.719
 more precisely to what this goal turned out 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.399
 it is primarily a blow or pass 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.799
 lousy thing that is still not clear 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.840
 incomprehensible because it is parshivlyuk 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 if there was Dima kombarov it is obvious 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.260
 it would have been a bad shade besides the blow 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 transfer Sergei brazenly impacted 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.909
 an unsure douglas game well naturally 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.100
 ricochet you wonder but all these factors 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.590
 met in the first half here's a punch 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 transfer of a parshivlyuk here uncertain game 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.259
 Douglas and here's the bounce just first 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 half these factors were separated by a friend 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.350
 from each other in the second they formed a single 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 whole 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.060
 and someone says that such a goal should not 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.060
 there might have been something else 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.530
 the goal did not decorate and the rooms tell you 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.510
 if someone still thinks it is 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:02:00.710
 It was a random goal then here he is 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:02:02.180
 In fact, the random opan goal, by the way, these 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 two people support Moscow 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.670
 torpedo 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 but this is for those who do not know but to whom 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.760
 just wondering 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.100
 oh yeah besides these three factors which 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.140
 I already said I forgot about the most important thing 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.030
 this dedication game until the end 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.800
 call it what you want after all not always 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.020
 Davydov and subcategory of urals in that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 would seem to be an ordinary moment and would get 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.560
 promise ball and did not give an assist 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.630
 i ask hatch and the most meritorious thing is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.280
 the end played every footballer is red 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.890
 white t-shirts throughout the match 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360
 I became a joke on kambarov and he 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.080
 by the way in the second half was one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.570
 of the best 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.280
 I remember this moment when he 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.410
 the price of a yellow card apparently threw the ball 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.060
 to return to defense because 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.310
 differently both strong dima could not 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.690
 do it and by the way this card 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.090
 won't let him in the next match 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 play against sibling know for 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.900
 me this is a little game this season 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.350
 after which I want to thank 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 every football player Spartak 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.670

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.680
 whether goat goal professor ebert rye and 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 Davydov for half the time in 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.580
 the four created something at the gates of the dynamo 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.010
 Ushakovu only for this moment separate 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.140
 Thank you, Yuri, who could also be different 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.650
 Timofeev for interrupting dangerous 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.200
 attack 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.880
 the company for the yellow for hot and three well 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.580
 our took them a central defender 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.290
 who skillfully did it for what artem 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.330
 edges and I want to say ten times 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.720
 thirds of our team 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.970
