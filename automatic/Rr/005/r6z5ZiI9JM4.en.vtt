00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.290 
that I think is special about the school
is<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.530> degree<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.920> which<00:02:53.190> everything<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
is the degree to which everything is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.240 
is the degree to which everything is
open<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.290> everything<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.860> built<00:02:56.129> on

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
open here and everything is built on

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640 
open here and everything is built on
trust<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.910> as<00:02:57.629> an<00:02:57.810> example<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.379> that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
trust and as an example of that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.220 
trust and as an example of that
the<00:02:59.010> way<00:02:59.159> we<00:02:59.340> handle<00:02:59.550> materials<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.569> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the way we handle materials is that
