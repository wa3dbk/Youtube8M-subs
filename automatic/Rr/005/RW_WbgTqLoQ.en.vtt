average by about two books a week and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.569 
average by about two books a week and
that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> slow<00:01:33.720> week<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.280> say

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that is on a slow week so I'm gonna say

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.210 
that is on a slow week so I'm gonna say
the<00:01:35.790> average<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> month<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.900> eight<00:01:37.220> but

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the average for the month is eight but

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.450 
the average for the month is eight but
on<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.780> months<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.799> book<00:01:41.130> releases

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
on really good months for book releases

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.389 
on really good months for book releases
then<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.540> rise<00:01:43.170> higher<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then it can rise higher but that is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.679 
then it can rise higher but that is
paper<00:01:44.670> box<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.540> ebooks<00:01:46.439> combined<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.369> i<00:01:47.689> don't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
paper box and ebooks combined so i don't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
paper box and ebooks combined so i don't
know<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> lessens<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> blow<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
know if that lessens the blow of that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
know if that lessens the blow of that
number<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> fourth<00:01:51.810> question<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
number or not so the fourth question is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
number or not so the fourth question is
