of inspire to get out there right right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
of inspire to get out there right right
so<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> notice<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.470> pronounced<00:01:13.770> Bend

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so the I notice I have a pronounced Bend

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
so the I notice I have a pronounced Bend
here<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> aesthetic<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.540> does<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
here is that aesthetic or does it have a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.289 
here is that aesthetic or does it have a
well<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> both<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.060> things

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
well it's both right so we do things

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.789 
well it's both right so we do things
like<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.780> vendetta<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.320> start<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
like that at vendetta would start with

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.170 
like that at vendetta would start with
the<00:01:19.950> function<00:01:20.130> first<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> can

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the function first and then if you can

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
the function first and then if you can
make<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> look<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.320> better

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
make it look pretty that's that's better

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
make it look pretty that's that's better
and<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> reason<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> band<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and so the reason for this band is a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
and so the reason for this band is a
commuter<00:01:25.650> bike<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.310> being

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
commuter bike is all about being

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
commuter bike is all about being
comfortable<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> work<00:01:27.450> we're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
comfortable on your way to work we're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
comfortable on your way to work we're
not<00:01:27.750> trying<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> sprint<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> finish<00:01:29.070> yeah

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
not trying to sprint for the finish yeah

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
not trying to sprint for the finish yeah
and<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.270> band<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> soften<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and so we do this band to soften up the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
and so we do this band to soften up the
ride<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> rear<00:01:32.159> trying<00:01:32.479> if<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.810> were

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ride for the rear trying if we were

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
ride for the rear trying if we were
building<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.320> track<00:01:34.530> bike<00:01:34.770> probably<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.579> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
building a track bike probably not so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.940 
building a track bike probably not so
much<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.119> Ben<00:01:36.299> stage<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.780> right

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
much on Ben stage right right

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.940 
much on Ben stage right right

the curve of the Ratan and echo that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
the curve of the Ratan and echo that
curve<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.500> even<00:01:52.619> curve<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
curve down through and we even curve the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.139 
curve down through and we even curve the
even<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.909> fenders<00:01:54.210> day<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.539> well<00:01:54.810> better<00:01:55.170> stay

cables<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.830> noticing<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.640> yeah<00:01:59.880> cables

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
cables I'm not noticing me yeah cables

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.420 
cables I'm not noticing me yeah cables
are<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.600> internal<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:01.830> as<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.220> lights

steel<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.240> we<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.540> form<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> mandrel

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
steel that we then form with a mandrel

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.950 
steel that we then form with a mandrel
to<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> shape<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.610> tube<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.570> braise

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
to the shape of the tube and then braise

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.390 
to the shape of the tube and then braise
that<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.800> when<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> fun<00:02:50.160> starts

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that on and that's when the fun starts

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.830 
that on and that's when the fun starts
for<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> painter<00:02:50.970> because<00:02:51.210> he's<00:02:51.360> got<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> mask

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
for the painter because he's got a mask

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.290 
for the painter because he's got a mask
and<00:02:52.140> cut<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.500> these<00:02:52.680> edges<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:53.910> it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and cut all these edges so it's it's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000 
and cut all these edges so it's it's
both<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.630> pain<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.050> braise<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.650> pain<00:02:55.800> for<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
both a pain to braise and a pain for the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.590 
both a pain to braise and a pain for the
painter<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.580> look<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> definitely<00:02:57.420> worth

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
