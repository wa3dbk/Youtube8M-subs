from when he was being a baptized and I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.880 
from when he was being a baptized and I
see<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.489> he<00:04:04.550> had<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.730> longest<00:04:05.660> big<00:04:06.200> on<00:04:06.379> that

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
what is the point of that

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.530 
what is the point of that
I<00:04:34.010> worried<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.700> was<00:04:34.880> going<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.210> trade<00:04:35.389> on<00:04:35.510> it

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540

I worried this was going to trade on it
well<00:04:35.990> that's<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.320> risk<00:04:36.470> isn't<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.040> to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
well that's the risk isn't it just to

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.129 
well that's the risk isn't it just to
say<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.520> she's<00:04:37.910> got<00:04:38.090> awake<00:04:38.360> as<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.750> human

being<00:04:39.320> like<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.770> know<00:04:39.800> then<00:04:40.250> we<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.729> even

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
being like you know then we like even

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.310 
being like you know then we like even
when<00:04:41.060> she's<00:04:41.270> gone<00:04:41.450> think<00:04:41.840> about<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> bit

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
when she's gone think about a bit

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.510 
when she's gone think about a bit
there's<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.560> bit<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.740> her<00:04:42.860> dress<00:04:43.130> still
