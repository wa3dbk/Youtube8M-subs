 educate tina the lord of education number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.570
 one of Latin America in this video we're going 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.259
 to work on the roots on the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.660
 roots of whole numbers let's see 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.199
 the all the cases that we can 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.260
 present the first two are going to be by 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.609
 example the first case is to have a root 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 with even index and positive radicand whose 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.450
 result will always be positive by 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.740
 example 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:42.890
 the square root of 4 that is equal to 2 or 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:46.520
 the fourth root of 81 that is equal to 3 is 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.630
 to say in both examples we have a 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.579
 root with an even index and positive 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.320
 and the result is positive 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.070
 in the same branch we will find the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 roots that have odd index 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.610
 and filing positive whose result 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.460
 It will also always be positive for 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.440
 example we can work with the root 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.040
 cubic of 8 odd and radicando index 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.600
 positive that the result will be 2 or 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 because not with 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:36.680
 fifth root of 1024 that is equal to 4 in 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.040
 this case we have two roots with index 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.930
 odd and positive filing and the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 result is positive 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.810
 another one of the cases that we can 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.190
 present is to work with an index 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.230
 odd again but with a radicando 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.040
 negative in this case the result 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.710
 it's always going to be negative and let's see 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.900
 for example that if we have 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.970
 cubic root of minus 8 this is going to be 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.860
 equal at least 2 look 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.280
 index 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.820
 an odd index and negative 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 result is negative or because the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.600
 cube root of minus 27 whose result 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.780
 is equal to minus 3 we are in the same 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.870
 case and finally let's have the case 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.410
 more curious that is to have one and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 root with even index and negative radicand 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.490
 in this case the result or what we're going 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.050
 to do or what we are going to say is that 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.050
 this has no solution 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.640
 it has no solution 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 in the numerical set of the reals in 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.129
 that has no solution 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.690
 in the numerical set of the reals and 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.540
 this will always be like this every time 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.209
 let's have a root with even index and 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 being negative is not going to have 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.519
 solution for example is not going to have 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.560
 solution the square root of minus 4 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.660
 this simply does not 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.660
 it has a solution 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.120
 the set of reals 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.850
 educational I recommend the following 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.850
 videos so you can keep learning
