here sad thing is is I had to build it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.020 
here sad thing is is I had to build it
off-camera<00:00:44.380> as<00:00:44.650> my<00:00:44.800> first<00:00:45.100> build<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:45.820> cut<00:00:46.000> me

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
off-camera as my first build so cut me

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.140 
off-camera as my first build so cut me
some<00:00:46.270> slack<00:00:46.470> but<00:00:47.470> I<00:00:47.500> did<00:00:47.830> successfully<00:00:48.489> build

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
some slack but I did successfully build

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.460 
some slack but I did successfully build
a<00:00:49.480> still<00:00:49.900> coil<00:00:50.530> sleeper<00:00:51.339> build<00:00:52.080> this<00:00:53.080> one's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
a still coil sleeper build this one's

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.560 
a still coil sleeper build this one's
kind<00:00:53.830> of<00:00:53.920> shot<00:00:54.250> up<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.760> practicing<00:00:55.360> with<00:00:55.540> it

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
kind of shot up and practicing with it

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
kind of shot up and practicing with it
to<00:00:56.350> try<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.589> do<00:00:56.739> some<00:00:56.920> cloud<00:00:57.190> chasing<00:00:59.040> but<00:01:00.040> uh

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to try and do some cloud chasing but uh

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.049 
to try and do some cloud chasing but uh
next<00:01:01.210> build<00:01:01.659> I<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.040> new<00:01:03.190> camera<00:01:03.430> coming<00:01:03.940> so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
next build I got a new camera coming so

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.720 
next build I got a new camera coming so
I<00:01:04.120> can<00:01:04.300> face<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.890> different<00:01:05.890> angles<00:01:06.250> what<00:01:06.550> have

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
I can face it different angles what have

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I can face it different angles what have
you<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.300> then<00:01:08.610> you'll<00:01:09.610> see<00:01:09.880> how<00:01:10.150> i<00:01:10.180> exactly

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
you and then you'll see how i exactly

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.770 
you and then you'll see how i exactly
build<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:15.460> apologize<00:01:15.909> for<00:01:16.330> not

showing<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.380> how<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.500> build<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:17.979> because<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
showing you how to build this because I

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.070 
showing you how to build this because I
didn't<00:01:20.650> know<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:22.300> I<00:01:22.330> couldn't<00:01:22.780> show<00:01:23.020> you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
didn't know that I couldn't show you

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.490 
didn't know that I couldn't show you
because<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:24.580> camera<00:01:25.180> can't<00:01:25.480> get<00:01:25.660> there<00:01:25.900> it's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
because my camera can't get there it's

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.740 
because my camera can't get there it's
my<00:01:26.650> laptop<00:01:26.860> I'm<00:01:27.370> using<00:01:27.580> right<00:01:27.850> now<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.720> I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
my laptop I'm using right now so I

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.530 
my laptop I'm using right now so I
couldn't<00:01:29.050> get<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.410> right<00:01:29.440> angle<00:01:30.010> so<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.580> tried

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
couldn't get the right angle so I tried

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.070 
couldn't get the right angle so I tried
but<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.380> won't<00:01:32.560> let<00:01:32.740> me<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:34.420> modified<00:01:35.050> my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
but it won't let me and I modified my

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.030 
but it won't let me and I modified my
Patriot<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.210> did<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.690> just<00:01:38.020> drilled<00:01:38.770> out

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
Patriot what I did is I just drilled out

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.840 
Patriot what I did is I just drilled out
the<00:01:39.340> side<00:01:40.120> holes<00:01:40.450> just<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.870> little<00:01:41.440> bit<00:01:41.620> not<00:01:42.010> not

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
the side holes just a little bit not not

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.180 
the side holes just a little bit not not
too<00:01:43.090> much<00:01:43.330> practice<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.260> guess<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.710> did<00:01:44.920> draw

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
too much practice I guess I did draw

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.590 
too much practice I guess I did draw
them<00:01:45.310> out<00:01:45.400> probably<00:01:45.760> like<00:01:45.820> three<00:01:46.180> times<00:01:46.420> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
them out probably like three times the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.170 
them out probably like three times the
size<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:47.160> stalk<00:01:48.160> but<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:50.550> wanted<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.730> air<00:01:51.910> flow

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
size of stalk but I wanted that air flow

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.730 
size of stalk but I wanted that air flow
man<00:01:52.480> and<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:54.220> got<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.640> spire<00:01:55.030> subohm<00:01:55.780> battery

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
man and I got the spire subohm battery

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.060 
man and I got the spire subohm battery
30<00:01:57.700> watt<00:01:58.830> cannot<00:01:59.830> wait<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.280> get<00:02:00.430> my<00:02:00.460> 50<00:02:00.940> watt<00:02:01.150> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
30 watt cannot wait to get my 50 watt I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.770 
30 watt cannot wait to get my 50 watt I
mean<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.250> don't<00:02:03.760> know<00:02:04.000> what<00:02:04.120> I'm<00:02:04.210> getting<00:02:04.450> yet

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
but I cannot wait to get it and here she

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.040 
but I cannot wait to get it and here she
is<00:02:07.990> no<00:02:08.440> clone<00:02:09.119> legit

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:28.910 

let's<00:02:15.560> take<00:02:15.740> some<00:02:15.950> reps<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.710> we<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.070> get

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:46.680 

oh<00:02:33.020> yeah<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:03:00.410 

getting<00:02:47.690> some<00:02:47.900> clouds<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.800> boy<00:02:49.840> yeah

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.870 

I<00:03:02.870> mean<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:04.650> even<00:03:04.890> trying<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.400> harder

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
I mean I'm even trying that harder

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.760 
I mean I'm even trying that harder
Merkin<00:03:06.240> clouds<00:03:07.610> epic<00:03:08.610> setup<00:03:09.770> definitely

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
Merkin clouds epic setup definitely

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.430 
Merkin clouds epic setup definitely
recommend<00:03:11.250> next<00:03:11.760> time<00:03:11.940> I've<00:03:12.090> built<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:13.260> dual

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
recommend next time I've built the dual

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.220 
recommend next time I've built the dual
coil<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.860> sleeper<00:03:14.250> oh<00:03:14.810> definitely<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:16.050> on

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
coil with sleeper oh definitely be on

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.920 
coil with sleeper oh definitely be on
camera<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:17.130> got<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> new<00:03:18.060> camera<00:03:18.300> coming<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.810> I
