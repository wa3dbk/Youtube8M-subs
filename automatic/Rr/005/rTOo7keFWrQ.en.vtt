00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hey guys 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.060
 today I will're making a video now 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.779
 about what are the chipset chipset 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 motherboard then let's start right now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.269
 what is a chipset the chipset is a 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 chip set as the name of 7 is a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 set with various functions the board 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.500
 since communicating with hd as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
 memories as your audio driver 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 is also directly connected to the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.989
 bus speed 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 processor and memory 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.649
 if you see the last video about how the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 their speed is important and should be 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.780
 approximate this is one more item that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 Influence on the speed of your pc 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
 its processor and the memory are good 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 bad chipset you will have a speed 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 download on your computer 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 so how is the chipset composed of seeing 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.790
 This we need to know a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 little old motherboards 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.280
 for you to see what the chips were like 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.970
 this image is a motherboard of some 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.979
 years ago I had dozens of chips 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.020
 for all sides 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.240
 each of them has an important function 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 they were not concentrated but each 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 one of them had a specific function and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 very important 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.579
 as technology became 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.460
 were concentrating these chips and now 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.170
 are only two major are these 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.630
 What's in the picture for you? 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 this change really started in 1995 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.110
 if you go looking in your campaign to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.540
 where they will be hiding underneath 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 heat sink so I do not recommend it 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.790
 look there because you will find a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.530
 piece of metal on top 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 Let's go then a little bit basically 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.960
 over north bridge and continue north 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.119
 bridge north bridge stayed with the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.909
 connection to the processor and has 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.740
 the memory controller functions 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.590
 controller PCRF pressure controller 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.539
 gp interface bus for 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 data transfer with the south bridge 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 for more information the 9 bridge stay 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.920
 connected here on the channel you stay 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.940
 explaining this 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 the main ones and how well it works 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.970
 explained with a video soon 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.590
 suffered said the south bridge then that is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 as important as us 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.819
 only it has different functions it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 controls the devices a board of 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.440
 input and output 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.660
 such as doors to the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.660
 current storage after 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.069
 she does communication with your hd ports 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.310
 usb sound board onboard bus 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.280
 pci tracks pci express the clock 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.790
 configuration memory time which is the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.480
 cnrs configuration software that bios 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.350
 of the motherboard and it is the point what 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.340
 controls these functions 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.720
 happened is also making a video 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.090
 more specific about how it 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.130
 it works exactly is posting here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.580
 on the channel then stay connected 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.400
 manufacturers the big ones 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.239
 57 current manufacturers are amd and intel 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.590
 and formerly had many companies 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.959
 that they only did as he got 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.780
 increasingly centralized 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.350
 only these three were major 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.019
 but do not confuse a chipset maker 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.140
 with motherboard manufacturer 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.690
 there are over 60 companies that manufacture 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.540
 motherboard that I've been researching then 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 it is not because the chipset is amd that your 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.660
 md motherboard 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.060
 you can have an asus with the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.829
 intel and so on 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.760
 how to choose a motherboard with chipset 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:56.370
 good woman mode is to get the model of 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.260
 motherboard with chipset search have 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.660
 liked the bus you want 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.130
 Do you have the drivers you want some? 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.410
 specific action for sound capture 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.000
 some to video other more 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.650
 generalized then this varies greatly 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.579
 any doubt can let me that 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.040
 our questions that she is 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.280
 answering you and helping you buy a 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.840
 good motherboard for then laid staff 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
 the chipset is one of the main 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.590
 components of the pc controls several 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.690
 functions that are vital to the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.880
 correct of your computer 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.620
 so this is personal if you like 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.510
 video leaves I liked it down here 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.280
 subscribe to the channel on this button 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.320
 what appears in the middle of the screen or there 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.270
 down the video if you want more 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.610
 information on chipset bridge north and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.350
 South Bridge is posting here on the channel 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.690
 more videos coming soon 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.690
 So stay tuned and a hug for you.
