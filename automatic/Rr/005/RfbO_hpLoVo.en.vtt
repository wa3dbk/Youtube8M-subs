00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.710
 they the king are in a new video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome once again to my channel 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.759
 gentlemen on this occasion we are with a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 video quickito a video cortito a video 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.740
 informative where I will comment 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.570
 when the demo and the content that comes out 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 has as well as solving some 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.409
 questions that surely have the demo 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.039
 the demo of pes 2016 comes on the 13th 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:28.589
 of August exactly within five 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 days there is practically nothing left but the 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.449
 truth is that the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.850
 demo can go perfectly between the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.010
 twelve noon and 78 in the afternoon 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.929
 - Spanish time - one season went to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.839
 that 2 o'clock in the afternoon I do not remember 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.300
 whether it was p 2014 or 2015 the other season 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.309
 I remember that it was available but not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.109
 We could not find it if it was not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.449
 looking for the directly you enter the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:56.909
 store either ps3 ps4 xbox 360 or xbox one 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.409
 you enter the store or the store as 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.769
 you want or to market call it what you want 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.379
 you hit the bar to search search and 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.500
 you put it pro 2016 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.090
 2016 or demo pro evolution soccer '2016 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.620
 what I let you put it you are looking for it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.830
 you are looking for but surely we will go 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.990
 informing each other via twitter that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.660
 it's important I always say that I 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 follow well and the following not that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.920
 will contain the demo basically the other 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 day a week ago eight days ago so 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 I was the offices of konami trying and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.140
 testing a pes demo 2016 was a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 demo that was more advanced than the demo 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 of the e3 that they tested among other robbie 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.899
 rom and seba fernandez but it was a demo 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.090
 lower than the demo they are testing 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.640
 right now at gamescom in germany 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 so basically in the demo that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 we will be testing surely be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040
 exactly the same as they have in some 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 disk in terms of equipment teams 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.350
 they have are bayern of Munich juventus 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.899
 roma in terms of European teams in 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.130
 about American teams 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.590
 specifically from brazil we will have the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 Brazilian League Palmeiras Corinthians in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 As for selections we will have Brazil 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.520
 already france with these equipment we can 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 play matches up I think I remember 15 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 minutes we can put the little arrows 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 purple red greens 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.700
 blue as you want we can put 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 penalty shootout I think I remember that yes 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.180
 what we do not know and what they have not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 made clear is if we will have the weather 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.640
 dynamic activated because I say it because 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.370
 in the demo that I next to the chicken goes to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.220
 broke has been the primary one too 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.720
 yes to other how many youtubers and people from 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.020
 press has been able to prove in the offices 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.210
 of konami 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.090
 dynamic weather was not available 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.890
 the effect that causes was not activated 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.450
 the rain on the ground of the game yes 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 that was activated but the weather 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 dynamic not so that at the moment what 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.060
 have left a little in the air not 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.280
 well basically that's what we already know 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.210
 let's not give it away, I told you before 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.120
 I think it will be available for ps3 ps4 360 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.970
 and one at the time of computer does not 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.580
 knows nothing because it facilitates the answer 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.800
 It is very easy subject piracy theme 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.870
 piracy the faults of konami the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.330
 you meet the pirates as simple as that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.680
 of simple and point 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.390
 a few years ago I think it was with the demo 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.420
 of 2014, the demo was also released 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.760
 for PC for PC and a week was already 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.650
 everything all of codified everything from 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.780
 encrypted and you knew exactly the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.120
 list of equipment and others partly 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.950
 error of konami partly also error 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.300
 of the pirates I could thank you 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.920
 to all the people who pirate the games 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.360
 not for that reason many times 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.370
 companies decide not to take the demos 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.050
 for for computer but good I think 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.030
 that in the end they end up pulling a little 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.910
 later on but for now I say ps3 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.530
 pc 4 360 and one you already know a team that 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.180
 contains three European teams 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.569
 the Americans and two selections 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.110
 matches of up to 15 minutes surely 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.209
 we can control practically all 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.370
 the options of the parties do not 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.980
 flechitas and others the only thing that the only 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.540
 the only thing we have in the air is the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.209
 dynamic weather theme if it will be 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.980
 activated or not already in this demo without more 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.709
 gentlemen suddenly you liked the day 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.120

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.380
 demo downloaded apart from what we'll do 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.570
 a comparison in the following villas 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.580
 a comparative ps3 pc 4 as we did 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.530
 last year to see the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.239
 graphic differences between one and the other 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.489
 that are going to notice this year I think 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.620
 even more so when the demo is 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.770
