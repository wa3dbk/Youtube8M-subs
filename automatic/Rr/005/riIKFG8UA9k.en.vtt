make a 360-degree turn and now you got
full<00:02:18.530> coverage<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.430> looks<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.610> factory

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
full coverage and it looks like factory

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.600 
full coverage and it looks like factory
molding<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> inside<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.100> also<00:02:22.310> use

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
molding on the inside you can also use

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.580 
molding on the inside you can also use
it<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:22.820> gas<00:02:23.120> caps<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.630> have<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> wide<00:02:24.200> edge

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
it on gas caps that have a wide edge

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.560 
it on gas caps that have a wide edge
there<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.550> be<00:02:25.610> difficult<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.090> wrap<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.390> one

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
there it can be difficult to wrap in one

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.630 
there it can be difficult to wrap in one
piece<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.050> cut<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.830> top<00:02:28.130> edge<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
piece so you cut it to the top edge and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.460 
piece so you cut it to the top edge and
then<00:02:29.150> start<00:02:29.420> your<00:02:29.540> stripper<00:02:29.900> moment<00:02:30.320> hold

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
then start your stripper moment hold

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.560 
then start your stripper moment hold
this<00:02:30.770> time<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.190> bottom<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> client

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
this time at the bottom so the client

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.970 
this time at the bottom so the client
doesn't<00:02:32.690> see<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.290> when<00:02:33.470> then<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
doesn't see it so when then from the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.430 
doesn't see it so when then from the
side<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.550> original<00:02:34.640> pane<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.270> hidden<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.959> it

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
side the original pane is hidden and it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.930 
side the original pane is hidden and it
looks<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.650> factory<00:02:37.040> molding<00:02:37.340> professional

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
looks like factory molding professional

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.900 
looks like factory molding professional
and<00:02:38.090> clean<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:39.190> notoriously<00:02:40.190> difficult<00:02:40.370> area

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
and clean a notoriously difficult area

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.370 
and clean a notoriously difficult area

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
to wrap on vehicles is underneath the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.430 
to wrap on vehicles is underneath the
headlights<00:02:43.040> if<00:02:43.310> they<00:02:43.520> cannot<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.880> removed

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
headlights if they cannot be removed

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
especially if it's a white vehicle so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.880 
especially if it's a white vehicle so
what<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.810> do<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.080> once<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.410> cut<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.709> film

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
what you can do is once you cut the film

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.620 
what you can do is once you cut the film
to<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.250> bottom<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> light<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:50.420> tuck

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
to the bottom of the light and then tuck

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.360 
to the bottom of the light and then tuck
it<00:02:50.660> under<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.080> as<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.620> comes<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:51.920> short<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:52.340> you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it under it as it comes up short as you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.120 
it under it as it comes up short as you
can<00:02:52.550> see<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.820> white<00:02:53.090> vehicle<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:54.140> carefully

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
can see as a white vehicle you carefully

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610 
can see as a white vehicle you carefully
and<00:02:55.370> methodically<00:02:55.760> put<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> strip<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.989> molded

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and methodically put a strip of molded

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.750 
and methodically put a strip of molded
hold<00:02:57.800> under<00:02:58.070> there<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.610> nice

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
hold under there so it's a nice

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.699 
hold under there so it's a nice
symmetrical<00:02:59.239> line<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.020> now<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.470> looks<00:03:00.500> like

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
symmetrical line and now it looks like

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.650 
symmetrical line and now it looks like
the<00:03:00.920> bumper<00:03:01.250> matches<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.060> nice<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.270> clean

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the bumper matches it nice and clean

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.410

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
super easy a very good place for mold

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.840 
super easy a very good place for mold

on<00:03:08.090> vehicles<00:03:08.600> especially<00:03:08.840> I've<00:03:09.170> had<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
on vehicles especially I've had the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.340 
on vehicles especially I've had the
severe<00:03:09.800> compound<00:03:10.310> curve<00:03:10.660> film<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.840> be

severe compound curve film can be

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.780 
severe compound curve film can be
overstressed<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.070> these<00:03:13.190> areas<00:03:13.489> which<00:03:13.640> could

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
overstressed in these areas which could

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.270 
overstressed in these areas which could
fail<00:03:14.120> over<00:03:14.420> time<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.590> what<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.800> do<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.100> put

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
fail over time so what you do is you put

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.890 
fail over time so what you do is you put
a<00:03:16.310> strip<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.790> mold<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.090> hold<00:03:17.330> half<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
looks like a shadow inside so you get

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
looks like a shadow inside so you get

this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> hard<00:03:35.480> gap<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.900> get<00:03:35.989> full<00:03:36.290> coverage

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
this is a hard gap to get full coverage

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.530 
this is a hard gap to get full coverage
on<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.519> take<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.700> lot<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:37.970> time<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:38.480> you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
on you can take a lot of time if you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.970 
on you can take a lot of time if you
want<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.750> wrap<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> material<00:03:39.140> farther<00:03:39.799> inside

the<00:03:40.160> car<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.030> all<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.209> do<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.360> cut<00:03:41.660> off<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the car so all you do is cut off the

the car so all you do is cut off the
material<00:03:42.019> as<00:03:42.410> normal<00:03:42.829> on<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.100> door<00:03:43.459> side<00:03:43.700> fold

the<00:03:44.510> material<00:03:44.600> in<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.049> then<00:03:45.140> put<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> strip

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the material in and then put a strip

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.920 
the material in and then put a strip
Molen<00:03:46.070> hold<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.459> looks<00:03:46.820> like<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> shadow<00:03:47.269> nice

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
Molen hold it looks like a shadow nice

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.370 
Molen hold it looks like a shadow nice
and<00:03:48.140> easy

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
and easy

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140 
and easy
where<00:03:48.920> molar<00:03:49.100> hole<00:03:49.340> really<00:03:49.730> comes<00:03:49.910> into<00:03:50.060> play

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
where molar hole really comes into play

that<00:03:50.420> was<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.660> big<00:03:51.260> compound<00:03:51.769> curves<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.910> one

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
that was on big compound curves this one

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.300 
that was on big compound curves this one
is<00:03:53.360> on<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.540> bed<00:03:54.049> cover<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.650> Frank's<00:03:55.010> Ford

is on the bed cover of Frank's Ford
Raptor<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.989> raw<00:03:57.320> fiberglass

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
Raptor and this raw fiberglass

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.440 
Raptor and this raw fiberglass
underneath<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.549> can<00:03:58.730> trap<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.090> material

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
underneath so you can trap the material

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.090 
underneath so you can trap the material
on<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.810> it's<00:03:59.930> notoriously<00:04:00.260> difficult<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.950> make

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
on so it's notoriously difficult to make

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.800 
on so it's notoriously difficult to make
sure<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.370> stays<00:04:01.610> on<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.850> edge<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.630> that

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
sure it stays on the edge on that

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.780 
sure it stays on the edge on that
compound<00:04:03.140> curve<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.160> can<00:04:04.280> cut<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.459> away

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
compound curve so you can cut it away

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.280 
compound curve so you can cut it away
about<00:04:05.060> an<00:04:05.209> eighth<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.510> an<00:04:05.660> inch<00:04:05.750> from<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.110> edge

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
about an eighth of an inch from the edge

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.110 
about an eighth of an inch from the edge
and<00:04:06.590> then<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.100> come<00:04:07.250> back<00:04:07.280> with<00:04:07.459> molded<00:04:07.910> hold

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
and then you come back with molded hold

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.880 
and then you come back with molded hold
the<00:04:08.329> mold<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> holds<00:04:08.810> going<00:04:09.019> half<00:04:09.320> on<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
the mold the holds going half on the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.640 
the mold the holds going half on the
painted<00:04:10.579> surface<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.390> half<00:04:11.900> on<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.200> film

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
painted surface and half on the film

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.620 
painted surface and half on the film
this<00:04:12.980> not<00:04:13.220> only<00:04:13.250> holds<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.880> film<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.239> keeps<00:04:14.450> it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
this not only holds the film it keeps it

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.630 
this not only holds the film it keeps it
from<00:04:14.810> failing<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.860> also<00:04:16.040> matches<00:04:16.609> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
from failing but also matches the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.060 
from failing but also matches the
factory<00:04:17.120> molding<00:04:17.690> on<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.049> actual<00:04:18.320> bed<00:04:18.650> itself

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
factory molding on the actual bed itself

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.800 
factory molding on the actual bed itself
so<00:04:19.700> again<00:04:19.910> you're<00:04:20.030> getting<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.329> beauty<00:04:20.780> of

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
so again you're getting the beauty of

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.360 
so again you're getting the beauty of
holding<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.440> film<00:04:21.680> especially<00:04:22.190> on<00:04:22.280> this

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
holding the film especially on this

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.670 
holding the film especially on this
compound<00:04:22.820> curve<00:04:23.060> but<00:04:23.630> I've<00:04:23.750> also<00:04:23.930> creating<00:04:24.530> it

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
compound curve but I've also creating it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.390 
compound curve but I've also creating it
and<00:04:24.890> matching

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
and matching

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.040 
and matching
actually<00:04:25.850> originally<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.570> vehicle<00:04:26.930> so

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
actually originally on the vehicle so

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.570 
actually originally on the vehicle so
again<00:04:27.259> nice<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.680> easy<00:04:27.800> straightforward<00:04:28.430> but

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
again nice and easy straightforward but

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.800 
again nice and easy straightforward but
this<00:04:28.699> holds<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.090> for<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.270> long<00:04:29.419> term<00:04:29.660> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
this holds it for the long term and

factory molding is wrap the mirror and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.159 
factory molding is wrap the mirror and
then<00:04:43.669> cut<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.180> material<00:04:44.660> away<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.080> have

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
then cut that material away so you have

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.779 
then cut that material away so you have
a<00:04:45.199> clear<00:04:45.530> gap<00:04:45.770> then<00:04:46.220> what<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.460> want<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.669> come

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
a clear gap then what you want to come

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.850

factory molding on the car and it holds

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.450 
factory molding on the car and it holds
the<00:05:03.169> film<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.680> is<00:05:03.800> perfect<00:05:04.190> for<00:05:04.250> long

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
the film so this is perfect for long

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.730 
the film so this is perfect for long
term<00:05:04.639> durability<00:05:05.050> molding<00:05:06.050> hole<00:05:06.139> is<00:05:06.320> very

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
term durability molding hole is very

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.560 
term durability molding hole is very
good<00:05:06.979> for<00:05:07.130> problem-solving<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.120> tourists<00:05:08.479> a

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
good for problem-solving and tourists a

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.719 
good for problem-solving and tourists a
difficult<00:05:09.050> area<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.380> wrap<00:05:09.590> with<00:05:09.919> good<00:05:10.370> cutting

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
difficult area to wrap with good cutting

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.000 
difficult area to wrap with good cutting
is<00:05:11.030> around<00:05:11.270> antennas<00:05:11.840> so<00:05:12.440> if<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.650> comes<00:05:12.860> up

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
is around antennas so if it comes up

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.520 
is around antennas so if it comes up
crooked<00:05:13.520> or<00:05:13.729> short<00:05:14.210> there<00:05:14.600> what<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:15.260> can<00:05:15.410> do

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
crooked or short there what you can do

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.620 
crooked or short there what you can do
is<00:05:15.680> come<00:05:15.889> back<00:05:16.039> with<00:05:16.280> mold<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.760> hold<00:05:16.940> start<00:05:17.539> at

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
is come back with mold and hold start at

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.629 
is come back with mold and hold start at
one<00:05:17.810> point<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:18.590> then<00:05:18.710> carefully<00:05:19.190> wrap<00:05:19.460> it

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
one point and then carefully wrap it

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.159 
one point and then carefully wrap it
around<00:05:19.729> so<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.060> have<00:05:20.150> even<00:05:20.510> symmetry<00:05:20.810> but

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
around so you have even symmetry but

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.870 
around so you have even symmetry but
again<00:05:21.349> this<00:05:21.470> looks<00:05:21.770> like<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.039> base<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.699> the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
again this looks like the base of the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.310 
again this looks like the base of the
antenna<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.570> matches<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.020> looks

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
antenna so it matches that looks

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.260 
antenna so it matches that looks
symmetrical<00:05:24.889> and<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.490> great<00:05:25.699> way<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:25.910> solve

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
symmetrical and a great way to solve

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.850 
symmetrical and a great way to solve
those<00:05:26.449> problems<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:26.960> are<00:05:27.080> often<00:05:27.530> common

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
those problems that are often common

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.110 
those problems that are often common
especially<00:05:28.250> if<00:05:28.310> they<00:05:28.400> gets<00:05:28.550> water<00:05:28.820> in<00:05:29.000> these

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120

antenna hard to cut on clean you can

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.460 
antenna hard to cut on clean you can
also<00:05:31.820> use<00:05:32.090> more<00:05:32.330> than<00:05:32.479> hold<00:05:32.690> after<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:33.199> mirrors

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
also use more than hold after a mirrors

material that's been peeling away and

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.770 
material that's been peeling away and
failing<00:05:43.190> so<00:05:43.760> once<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.000> cut<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.180> off<00:05:44.330> nice<00:05:44.570> and
