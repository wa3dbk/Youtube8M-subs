about<00:03:17.180> an<00:03:17.390> hour<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.110> my<00:03:19.010> lips<00:03:19.310> were<00:03:19.580> feeling

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
about an hour and my lips were feeling

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.140 
about an hour and my lips were feeling
really<00:03:20.450> dry<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:20.900> whenever<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.769> smiled<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.940> kind

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
really dry and whenever I smiled it kind

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.539 
really dry and whenever I smiled it kind
of<00:03:23.180> felt<00:03:23.390> like<00:03:23.450> my<00:03:23.780> lips<00:03:24.080> are<00:03:24.200> Crocky<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.400> then

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
of felt like my lips are Crocky so then

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.720 
of felt like my lips are Crocky so then
I<00:03:25.580> did<00:03:26.090> apply<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.510> lip<00:03:27.049> balm<00:03:27.290> over<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.190> it

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
I did apply a lip balm over it and it

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.729 
I did apply a lip balm over it and it
didn't<00:03:29.060> seem<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.329> affect<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.079> print<00:03:30.380> at<00:03:30.590> all

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
didn't seem to affect the print at all

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.160 
didn't seem to affect the print at all
so<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.190> it'd<00:03:31.489> be<00:03:31.670> smart<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.780> throughout

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
so I think it'd be smart that throughout

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.849 
so I think it'd be smart that throughout
the<00:03:33.350> day<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.100> would<00:03:34.250> apply<00:03:34.519> some<00:03:35.359> lip<00:03:35.630> balm

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
the day you would apply some lip balm

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.979 
the day you would apply some lip balm
