00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 hello subnormal we see each other again 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.210
 Of course you already know what this video of the balls is about 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.650
 well of the curiosities 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.269
 mistakes 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.799
 or whatever you want to call these incoherent videogames 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:12.670
 let us begin 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.530
 surely you have noticed that every hero must get all kinds of weapons 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.929
 oo money and other things to get well equipped against the fucking boss 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.220
 final but have you ever wondered where they keep so many crap 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.390
 like lin that is a asshole that can hardly wield the ward masters but 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.820
 can load more faces 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.090
 grenade swords amulets potions and much more 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.729
 this is explained in a very simple way 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.719
 all the heroes of the games buy their super infinite magic bag that 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.969
 comes next to the newspaper +10 with insen the nearest kiosk before going to the 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:46.690
 adventure 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 another similar concept is the so-called jamer I hope it's a kind of 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.970
 invisible vortex that allows characters to take immense things from the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:55.420
 nothing 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.000
 very common in the cartoon as box bondi who pulls a deck of two 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 meters or something else and revilla goes into the ground to all the subnormal that is 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.800
 put with him 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.880
 another thing that is very common since the beginning of the industry are the wells without 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.970
 fund the rivers that you can not cross if it is not for a piece of land or a 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.770
 platform that moves alone because if you fall you lose a life instantly 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.080
 the curious thing is not to wonder why they are there but who the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.880
 subnormal who took the trouble to dig them along the worlds to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.270
 it's harder for them to get to the heroes to get to the end 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.230
 and in the rivers or things like that the heroes can not swim and they drown 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.360
 shot would believe them if they were cats like those in the super nintendo game is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.250
 huacas as cats hate water but the famous belmont who in his 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.560
 training you learn to invoke beings of other dimensions and to fight against 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 undead but such swimming lessons are not included 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.330
 Once the legendary bloodline can not cross bodies of water because they have blood 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.390
 of vampires 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.080
 who knows 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.660
 it's weird but the belmont survive big falls but not the water 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.979
 let's go to the next error in many rpg games I always noticed something 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.180
 I'm not talking about you always start with a cardboard gun and filth 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.800
 you end up with the best weapon you could destroy an entire town just by taking out 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.129
 the one with the belt and with the best hits, nor that you are invariably 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.040
 irresistible to all the beautiful girls you find in every town that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.620
 visits and curiously 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.139
 one of the warriors of your team is secretly in love with you 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.169
 is not that, but the vast majority of the heroes of this type of games are 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.830
 gower fan of father or mother 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.639
 as in chrono trailero cell 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.779
 It is very common that you always have a mom who left because her father was 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 a great explorer who was lost years ago in going to the supermarket to buy 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:41.650
 drug 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.650
 operÃ© you gave your parents in an accident that he left mute for the rest 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.290
 of the game 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.690
 this happens in the best terror families number 4 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.620
 it's curious 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
 you always start your adventure being a level 1 jerk you bring a sword of 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.150
 wood or you need power suppa to make you strong but it never occurs to you 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.580
 the final boss face you from the beginning in the only two games that 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.680
 I've seen the final boss attack you in the first stage is in dark baker's 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.749
 super nintendo but that does not matter 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.609
 then it will attack you in the last world and the other is the super 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.249
 mario bros from nintendo and super nintendo that always attacks you that asshole of 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:18.809
 bushehr 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.639
 the thing is that when you're just a warrior apprentice the very superior evil 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.500
 final boss expects you to reach level 99 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.719
 the best weapons 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.980
 magic if having met your friends to help you 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.849
 I will give you a practical example the patriarch of the knights of the zodiac 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.769
 send his lower level warriors to finish with Seville and his 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.440
 friends 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.629
 but seeing that they only got stronger with the fights 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.309
 send others of the next level and so on when they arrive with him they are 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.859
 strong enough to defeat him 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.450
 the same goes at the beginning of castlevania circle of the moon 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.640
 Dracula kidnaps the old vampire hunter and in quotes he gets rid of the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.570
 inexperienced young people giving them the opportunity to improve terror 5 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.870
 because if you're going to save the world and everyone knows it, the merchants who sell it 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.889
 what you need to save them 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.949
 even if the king is not falling apart there will always be a clothesline 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.699
 stingy like crab gift that will give you everything at the price of gold 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.400
 instead of giving you everything to prevent the bad guys from destroying their 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.049
 possible to 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.050
 this explains why many characters develop kleptomania or 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.659
 well they just take things from the houses of others to get 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.690
 money and miscellaneous items 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.250
 There is too much need for heroes like Link to become 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.229
 friends of the alien 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.360
 well this is the whole first part 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.300
 any query send a text message with the word adicto games to 4 5 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.990
 6 7 2 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.830
 4 6 8 2 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.690
 4 4 4 4 4 1 1 2 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.820
 3 4 8 9 4 6 and a subnormal will answer them in an instant
