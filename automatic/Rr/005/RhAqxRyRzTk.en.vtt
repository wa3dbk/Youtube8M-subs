and<00:05:56.449> then<00:05:56.569> come<00:05:56.780> back<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:56.990> feather<00:05:57.440> it<00:05:57.740> can<00:05:58.099> be

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
and then come back and feather it can be

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.510 
and then come back and feather it can be
a<00:05:58.610> little<00:05:59.180> bit<00:05:59.419> harder<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.050> get<00:06:00.199> it<00:06:00.379> to<00:06:00.650> feather

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
a little bit harder to get it to feather

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.939 
a little bit harder to get it to feather
together<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:02.240> would<00:06:03.110> do<00:06:03.229> this<00:06:03.379> completely

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
together I would do this completely

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.839 
together I would do this completely
before<00:06:04.639> I<00:06:04.699> move<00:06:04.940> on<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.389> next<00:06:05.419> nail<00:06:06.849> then

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
before I move on to the next nail then

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.450
