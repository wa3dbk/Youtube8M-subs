natural that Bella wouldn't think that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.920 
natural that Bella wouldn't think that
automatically<00:02:41.239> because<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.600> don't<00:02:41.780> go<00:02:41.870> around

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
automatically because I don't go around

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.390 
automatically because I don't go around
