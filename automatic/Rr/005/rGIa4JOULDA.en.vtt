00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:06.712
(How do you feel about the result?)

00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:18.967
I really wanted to win but I couldn't.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:25.975
But the final was a great fight 

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:35.407
And I was able to find out what I need.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:39.192
(What do you think you need to learn?)

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:51.247
I need to improve my boxing skills.I need more sparring.

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:06.360
(What's your impression for Hareyama?)

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:18.628
He's a good fighter.I have to have stronger mind.

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:30.817
(Is your leg injured?)

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:43.097
It got injured before this tournament.

00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:46.411
I could hardly hide it when I was fighting Hareyama.

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:30.329
(What's your next goal?)

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:40.696
I'll have to start from the beginning.I'll try step by step.
