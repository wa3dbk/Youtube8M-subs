hey guys and welcome back to everything
DIY<00:00:01.890> today<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.520> gonna<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.730> doing<00:00:02.790> review<00:00:03.449> of

DIY today we're gonna be doing review of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.510 
DIY today we're gonna be doing review of
the<00:00:03.870> Michelin<00:00:04.350> Pilot<00:00:04.770> Super<00:00:04.920> Sport<00:00:05.100> tires

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
the Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.980 
the Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires
that<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:05.879> recently<00:00:06.089> installed<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.899> our

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
that we recently installed in our

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.940 
that we recently installed in our

so<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> little<00:00:08.610> background<00:00:08.790> our<00:00:09.179> car<00:00:09.389> before

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
so a little background our car before

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.410 
so a little background our car before
actually<00:00:10.019> get<00:00:10.139> into<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> review<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.130> have<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
actually get into the review we have a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.780 
actually get into the review we have a
2010<00:00:12.420> mazdaspeed3<00:00:13.139> that's<00:00:14.130> been<00:00:14.309> modified

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
2010 mazdaspeed3 that's been modified

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.650 
2010 mazdaspeed3 that's been modified
close<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:16.170> 300<00:00:17.010> wheel<00:00:17.490> horsepower<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
close to about 300 wheel horsepower and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.920 
close to about 300 wheel horsepower and
330<00:00:19.260> wheel<00:00:19.740> torque<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.460> also<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.420> oiled<00:00:21.900> your

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
330 wheel torque it also has oiled your

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.019 
330 wheel torque it also has oiled your
suspension<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.800> stiffer<00:00:23.340> rear<00:00:23.519> sway<00:00:23.789> bars

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
suspension and stiffer rear sway bars

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
suspension and stiffer rear sway bars
this<00:00:24.570> car<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> probably<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.529> sense<00:00:25.800> all

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
this car as you probably know sense all

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470 
this car as you probably know sense all
that<00:00:26.039> power<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> front<00:00:26.939> wheels

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that power to the front wheels

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
that power to the front wheels
so<00:00:27.599> gaining<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> traction<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.070> an

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
so gaining of traction can be an

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.519 
so gaining of traction can be an
obstacle<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.939> also<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> 60/40<00:00:31.349> weight

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
obstacle it also has a 60/40 weight

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.920 
obstacle it also has a 60/40 weight
distribution<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.520> understeer<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
distribution so understeer can also be a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.330 
distribution so understeer can also be a
problem<00:00:34.110> we've<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:34.469> these<00:00:34.710> tires<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.130> for

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
problem we've had these tires now for

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.030 
problem we've had these tires now for
about<00:00:35.520> 1500<00:00:36.149> miles<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.380> time<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.829> put

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
about 1500 miles and in that time we put

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
about 1500 miles and in that time we put
them<00:00:38.219> through<00:00:38.250> daily<00:00:39.180> driving<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.870> track<00:00:40.140> day<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
them through daily driving a track day a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
them through daily driving a track day a
bit<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> Canyon<00:00:41.640> runs<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.590> somewhat

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
bit of Canyon runs and a somewhat

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
bit of Canyon runs and a somewhat
torrential<00:00:44.309> day<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> rain<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.840> we're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
torrential day of rain so we think we're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.240 
torrential day of rain so we think we're
pretty<00:00:46.170> prepared<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> give<00:00:46.890> him<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> fair

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
pretty prepared to give him a fair

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.810 
pretty prepared to give him a fair
review<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> first<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.489> did<00:00:53.640> after

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
review the first thing we did after

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.939 
review the first thing we did after
getting<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.270> tires<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.440> turn<00:00:55.829> off

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
getting these tires was to turn off

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
getting these tires was to turn off
traction<00:00:56.399> control<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> floor<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.360> through

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
traction control and floor it through

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
traction control and floor it through
first<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.280> how<00:00:59.489> well<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
first and second just to see how well I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:10.160 
first and second just to see how well I
can<00:00:59.879> handle<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> power

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020 

immediately<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> say<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:12.000> pretty

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
immediately I have to say I'm pretty

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
immediately I have to say I'm pretty
impressed<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.140> almost<00:01:13.740> always<00:01:14.040> impossible

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
impressed it's almost always impossible

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
impressed it's almost always impossible
to<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.030> traction<00:01:15.479> through<00:01:15.659> first<00:01:15.930> gear<00:01:16.200> but

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to get traction through first gear but

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
to get traction through first gear but
with<00:01:16.530> these<00:01:16.710> tires<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.250> almost<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
with these tires it's almost as if you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
with these tires it's almost as if you
feel<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> momentum<00:01:18.750> through<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> spinning

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
feel the momentum through the spinning

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
feel the momentum through the spinning
and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.640> once<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.509> through

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and then once you get a bit through

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
and then once you get a bit through
second<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> tires<00:01:22.619> hook<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> definitely

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
second the tires hook this is definitely

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
second the tires hook this is definitely
not<00:01:24.149> something<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:24.720> used<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.530> our

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
not something we're used to with our

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.260 
not something we're used to with our

companies we've always had issues with

companies we've always had issues with

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
the super sports totally changed the way

I<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.920> handling<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.640> lot<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.030> do<00:02:04.180> it's<00:02:04.420> how

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
I know handling is a lot to do it's how

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.750 
I know handling is a lot to do it's how
your<00:02:05.110> suspension<00:02:05.650> setup<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.190> alignment<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
your suspension setup and alignment and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.220 
your suspension setup and alignment and
all<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.120> but<00:02:07.300> tires<00:02:07.570> can<00:02:07.840> also<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
all that but tires can also have a

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.660 
all that but tires can also have a
profound<00:02:08.650> effect<00:02:08.830> on<00:02:09.130> how<00:02:09.280> your<00:02:09.430> car<00:02:09.640> handles

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
profound effect on how your car handles

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.610 
profound effect on how your car handles
we've<00:02:10.390> thrown<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> car<00:02:10.930> around<00:02:11.140> some<00:02:11.350> pretty

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
we've thrown the car around some pretty

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.530 
we've thrown the car around some pretty
aggressive<00:02:11.890> corners<00:02:12.430> with<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.970> super<00:02:13.240> sports

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
aggressive corners with the super sports

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.090 
aggressive corners with the super sports
and<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.020> say<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.920> pretty

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and I have to say that it's pretty

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.920 
and I have to say that it's pretty
difficult<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.670> get<00:02:15.820> them<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.120> make<00:02:16.240> any<00:02:16.510> noise

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
difficult to get them to make any noise

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.380 
difficult to get them to make any noise
and<00:02:17.350> they<00:02:17.560> absolutely<00:02:17.880> hold<00:02:18.880> lines<00:02:19.150> like

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and they absolutely hold lines like

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.000 
and they absolutely hold lines like
they're<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:19.630> trails<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.320> also<00:02:20.500> feels<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.890> lot

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
they're on trails it also feels a lot

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.410 
they're on trails it also feels a lot
more<00:02:21.070> refined<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.700> controlled<00:02:22.150> around

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
more refined and controlled around

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.300 
more refined and controlled around
corners<00:02:22.840> where<00:02:23.020> maybe<00:02:23.200> my<00:02:23.380> old<00:02:23.560> tires<00:02:23.830> felt<00:02:24.220> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
corners where maybe my old tires felt a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.190 
corners where maybe my old tires felt a
bit<00:02:24.490> jittery<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.570> take<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> look<00:02:25.930> at<00:02:26.050> this

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
bit jittery just take a look at this

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.530 
bit jittery just take a look at this
clip<00:02:26.470> where<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.740> take<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.980> very<00:02:27.250> tight<00:02:27.550> 180<00:02:28.210> turn

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
clip where I take a very tight 180 turn

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:44.570 
clip where I take a very tight 180 turn
and<00:02:29.110> you'll<00:02:29.260> see<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.560> mean

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.890 

hopefully<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> guided<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
hopefully you can see that I guided the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.080 
hopefully you can see that I guided the
car<00:02:47.110> through<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> corner<00:02:48.040> with<00:02:48.340> limited

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
car through the corner with limited

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.930 
car through the corner with limited
steering<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.960> enough<00:02:50.680> throttle<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.580> engage

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
steering and enough throttle to engage

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820 
steering and enough throttle to engage
the<00:02:52.300> limited<00:02:52.660> slip<00:02:52.780> differential<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.560> was<00:02:53.740> able

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
the limited slip differential I was able

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.500 
the limited slip differential I was able
to<00:02:54.010> keep<00:02:54.220> my<00:02:54.280> line<00:02:54.670> throughout<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.210> whole

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to keep my line throughout the whole

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.630 
to keep my line throughout the whole
turn<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.230> little<00:02:56.710> protest<00:02:57.100> from<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> tyres

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
turn with little protest from the tyres

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.870 
turn with little protest from the tyres
then<00:02:58.540> exit<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.500> turn<00:02:59.740> at<00:03:00.040> maximum<00:03:00.640> throttle

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
then exit the turn at maximum throttle

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.090 
then exit the turn at maximum throttle
with<00:03:01.390> little<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.230> no<00:03:02.260> steering<00:03:02.620> correction

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
with little to no steering correction

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.650 
with little to no steering correction
with<00:03:03.250> my<00:03:03.370> last<00:03:03.640> set<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.850> tires<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.330> felt<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.630> I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
with my last set of tires I felt like I

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.330 
with my last set of tires I felt like I
had<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.900> input<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> lot<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.800> steering<00:03:06.070> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
had to input a lot of steering and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.520 
had to input a lot of steering and
throttle<00:03:06.400> correction<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.630> maintain<00:03:08.200> such<00:03:08.500> a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
throttle correction to maintain such a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.560 
throttle correction to maintain such a
smooth<00:03:08.860> line<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.460> turn<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
smooth line on this turn but with the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.510 
smooth line on this turn but with the
super<00:03:10.930> sports<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.470> feel<00:03:11.800> like<00:03:11.950> they're<00:03:12.130> almost

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
super sports I feel like they're almost

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.210 
super sports I feel like they're almost
just<00:03:12.820> gliding<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.020> responding<00:03:14.770> predictably

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
just gliding and responding predictably

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.100 
just gliding and responding predictably
to<00:03:15.550> what<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.730> input<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.390> think<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.720> has<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.900> lot

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
to what I input I think this has a lot

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170 
to what I input I think this has a lot
to<00:03:17.170> do<00:03:17.440> with<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> sidewall<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.340> tire<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
to do with the sidewall of the tire the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.870 
to do with the sidewall of the tire the
sidewall<00:03:19.630> isn't<00:03:20.230> overly<00:03:20.560> hard<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.460> good

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
sidewall isn't overly hard it's a good

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.480 
sidewall isn't overly hard it's a good
balance<00:03:22.270> between<00:03:22.360> soft<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.140> stiff<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.800> maybe

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
balance between soft and stiff and maybe

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.950 
balance between soft and stiff and maybe
you'll<00:03:24.670> be<00:03:24.790> able<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.030> tell<00:03:25.210> that<00:03:25.240> in<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.660> clip

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
you'll be able to tell that in this clip

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.420 
you'll be able to tell that in this clip
where<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.260> put<00:03:26.590> our<00:03:26.740> car<00:03:26.950> through<00:03:27.220> some

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
where I put our car through some

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:45.520 
where I put our car through some
high-speed<00:03:27.790> maneuvers

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.890 

if<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:46.610> look<00:03:46.760> at<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:46.970> sidewalls<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.570> looks<00:03:47.750> as

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
if you look at the sidewalls it looks as

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.870 
if you look at the sidewalls it looks as
though<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.140> Flex<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.680> 80<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.340> grip<00:03:49.640> and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
though the Flex is 80 and grip and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.910 
though the Flex is 80 and grip and
steering<00:03:50.240> field<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.900> can<00:03:51.080> see<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.560> way<00:03:51.740> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
steering field you can see the way the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.860 
steering field you can see the way the
sidewall<00:03:52.340> rebounds<00:03:52.970> predictably<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.690> that's

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
sidewall rebounds predictably and that's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.540 
sidewall rebounds predictably and that's
just<00:03:54.110> how<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.320> steering<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:54.920> handling<00:03:54.950> feels

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
just how the steering and handling feels

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.090 
just how the steering and handling feels
on<00:03:56.180> my<00:03:56.570> last<00:03:56.840> set<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.080> tires<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.830> what

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
on my last set of tires the what

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.890 
on my last set of tires the what
sidewalls<00:03:58.580> were<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.060> stiff<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.600> instead<00:03:59.840> of

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
sidewalls were so stiff that instead of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.230 
sidewalls were so stiff that instead of
being<00:04:00.400> controlled<00:04:01.400> through<00:04:01.790> high-speed

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
being controlled through high-speed

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.090 
being controlled through high-speed
maneuvers<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.930> felt<00:04:03.170> unstable<00:04:03.950> and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
maneuvers it felt unstable and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.140 
maneuvers it felt unstable and
unpredictable<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:10.100> pretty<00:04:10.430> phenomenal<00:04:10.580> the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
unpredictable it's pretty phenomenal the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.990 
unpredictable it's pretty phenomenal the
drastic<00:04:12.050> change<00:04:12.380> in<00:04:12.620> braking<00:04:13.070> feel<00:04:13.310> from<00:04:13.730> just

drastic change in braking feel from just
changing<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.480> tires<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.410> clip<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.920> go

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
changing the tires in this clip I go

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.460 
changing the tires in this clip I go
from<00:04:16.370> about<00:04:16.489> 60<00:04:17.000> miles<00:04:17.209> per<00:04:17.329> hour<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.260> mile

in<00:04:27.830> this<00:04:27.950> clip<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.340> was<00:04:28.460> practically<00:04:28.910> standing

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
in this clip I was practically standing

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.940 
in this clip I was practically standing
on<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.480> brake<00:04:29.630> pedal<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.170> there's<00:04:30.320> really<00:04:30.590> no

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
on the brake pedal and there's really no

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.730 
on the brake pedal and there's really no

tire squeaking to speak of the car also

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.100 
tire squeaking to speak of the car also
didn't<00:04:34.040> engage<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.850> ABS<00:04:34.910> system<00:04:35.360> because

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
didn't engage the ABS system because

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.350 
didn't engage the ABS system because
honestly<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.190> tires<00:04:37.400> didn't<00:04:37.790> lose<00:04:38.060> traction

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
honestly the tires didn't lose traction

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.780 
honestly the tires didn't lose traction
at<00:04:38.630> all<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.020> stopped<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:39.980> hard<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.430> quick<00:04:40.639> in

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
at all I stopped so hard and quick in

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.580 
at all I stopped so hard and quick in
this<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.270> actually<00:04:41.900> my<00:04:42.020> shoulder<00:04:42.350> hurt<00:04:42.500> a

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
this that actually my shoulder hurt a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.710 
this that actually my shoulder hurt a
little<00:04:42.710> bit<00:04:42.860> from<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.160> seatbelt<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.240> felt

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
little bit from the seatbelt and I felt

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.780 
little bit from the seatbelt and I felt
a<00:04:44.810> little<00:04:44.990> bit<00:04:45.260> ahsha's<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.400> definitely

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
a little bit ahsha's this is definitely

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.330 
a little bit ahsha's this is definitely
unexpected<00:04:47.570> with<00:04:47.810> my<00:04:47.960> last<00:04:48.320> set<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.650> tires<00:04:48.770> if

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
unexpected with my last set of tires if

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.370 
unexpected with my last set of tires if
I<00:04:49.550> push<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.000> pedal<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.389> hard<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.900> would<00:04:51.230> have

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
I push the pedal that hard I would have

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.890 
I push the pedal that hard I would have
certainly<00:04:51.889> lost<00:04:52.700> traction<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.450> engage<00:04:53.720> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
certainly lost traction and engage the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.470 
certainly lost traction and engage the
ABS<00:04:53.930> system<00:04:54.350> with<00:04:55.250> these<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.850> just<00:04:56.030> get<00:04:56.210> grip

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
ABS system with these you just get grip

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.900 
ABS system with these you just get grip
and<00:04:56.810> honestly<00:04:57.320> it's<00:04:57.620> kind<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.730> can

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
and honestly it's kind of like you can

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.970 
and honestly it's kind of like you can
feel<00:04:59.210> through<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> steering<00:04:59.780> wheel<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
feel through the steering wheel and the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.700 
feel through the steering wheel and the
pedals<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.490> just<00:05:02.330> every<00:05:02.690> piece<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.530> road

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
pedals that just every piece of the road

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.390 
pedals that just every piece of the road
the<00:05:03.860> tires<00:05:04.100> clinging<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.730> almost<00:05:09.250> these<00:05:10.250> are

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
the tires clinging to almost these are

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.460 
the tires clinging to almost these are
low-profile<00:05:11.000> tires<00:05:11.300> there's<00:05:11.660> only<00:05:11.840> so<00:05:12.230> much

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
low-profile tires there's only so much

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.010 
low-profile tires there's only so much
comfort<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.310> can<00:05:13.520> be<00:05:13.700> gained<00:05:13.940> we<00:05:14.510> also<00:05:14.690> have

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
comfort that can be gained we also have

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.540 
comfort that can be gained we also have
coilovers<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.740> other<00:05:16.100> suspension

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
coilovers and other suspension

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.790 
coilovers and other suspension
modifications<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.930> ride<00:05:18.080> will<00:05:18.320> always<00:05:18.620> be

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
modifications so the ride will always be

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.890 
modifications so the ride will always be
stiffer<00:05:19.040> ok<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.790> comfort<00:05:20.180> level<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.660> about

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
stiffer ok the comfort level is about

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.930 
stiffer ok the comfort level is about
average<00:05:21.620> compared<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.280> other<00:05:22.430> tires<00:05:22.700> I've

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
average compared to the other tires I've

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.760 
average compared to the other tires I've
had<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.330> car<00:05:23.540> honestly<00:05:24.290> I'm<00:05:24.380> not<00:05:24.530> too

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
had on the car honestly I'm not too

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.530 
had on the car honestly I'm not too
concerned<00:05:24.979> about<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.580> if<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.880> sidewalls<00:05:26.389> were

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
concerned about it if the sidewalls were

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.540 
concerned about it if the sidewalls were
any<00:05:26.690> softer<00:05:27.229> we<00:05:27.740> probably<00:05:28.070> loose<00:05:28.250> some<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.430> the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
any softer we probably loose some of the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.969 
any softer we probably loose some of the
handling<00:05:29.000> ability<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.750> my<00:05:30.260> main<00:05:30.500> objective

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
handling ability and my main objective

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.860 
handling ability and my main objective
for<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.250> car<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.790> better<00:05:31.970> performance<00:05:32.660> so

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
for this car is better performance so

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.420 
for this car is better performance so
I'm<00:05:33.020> pretty<00:05:33.229> happy<00:05:33.530> with<00:05:33.710> where<00:05:33.890> is<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.160> as

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
I'm pretty happy with where is that as

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.520 
I'm pretty happy with where is that as
far<00:05:34.550> as<00:05:34.610> noise<00:05:35.060> levels<00:05:35.479> go<00:05:35.690> I<00:05:35.720> really<00:05:36.140> can't

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
far as noise levels go I really can't

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.409 
far as noise levels go I really can't
tell<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.800> difference<00:05:37.280> this<00:05:37.520> car<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:37.970> lot<00:05:38.240> of

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
tell a difference this car is a lot of

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.900 
tell a difference this car is a lot of
cabin<00:05:38.780> noise<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.350> so<00:05:40.010> I'm<00:05:40.130> figuring<00:05:40.760> it's

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
cabin noise and so I'm figuring it's

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.490 
cabin noise and so I'm figuring it's
probably<00:05:41.270> about<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.510> same<00:05:41.720> as<00:05:41.870> my<00:05:42.020> other<00:05:42.140> sets

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
probably about the same as my other sets

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.350 
probably about the same as my other sets
what<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.830> can't<00:05:43.070> say<00:05:43.310> is<00:05:43.550> that<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:43.880> didn't<00:05:44.180> add

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
what I can't say is that it didn't add

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.060 
what I can't say is that it didn't add
any<00:05:44.690> more<00:05:44.900> noise<00:05:45.140> than<00:05:45.169> what<00:05:45.800> we're<00:05:45.950> already

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
any more noise than what we're already

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.680 
any more noise than what we're already
used<00:05:46.340> to

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.270 

we<00:05:51.690> drove<00:05:51.870> through<00:05:51.930> some<00:05:52.290> pretty<00:05:52.500> awful<00:05:52.830> rain

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
we drove through some pretty awful rain

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.770 
we drove through some pretty awful rain
recently<00:05:53.820> which<00:05:54.060> gave<00:05:54.330> us<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.570> opportunity

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
recently which gave us the opportunity

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.420 
recently which gave us the opportunity
to<00:05:55.290> see<00:05:55.500> how<00:05:55.650> well<00:05:55.860> these<00:05:55.980> tires<00:05:56.250> would

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
to see how well these tires would

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.580 
to see how well these tires would
perform

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.190 

in<00:06:03.370> some<00:06:03.700> instances<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.450> was<00:06:04.570> traveling<00:06:04.990> on<00:06:05.050> the

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
the ground I was absolutely floored how

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.840 
the ground I was absolutely floored how
all<00:06:11.260> these<00:06:11.380> tires<00:06:11.620> maintain<00:06:12.130> stability<00:06:12.370> and

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
all these tires maintain stability and

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.790 
all these tires maintain stability and

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
like I was driving on dry pavement if I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.450 
like I was driving on dry pavement if I

hit the brakes or accelerated it just
honestly<00:06:21.460> felt<00:06:21.730> like<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.480> tires<00:06:22.750> were

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
honestly felt like the tires were

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.960 
honestly felt like the tires were
responding<00:06:23.590> instantaneously<00:06:24.310> we<00:06:24.610> also<00:06:24.730> had

responding instantaneously we also had

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.240 
responding instantaneously we also had
some<00:06:25.000> time<00:06:25.419> to<00:06:25.750> test<00:06:26.050> how<00:06:26.380> well<00:06:26.410> these<00:06:26.980> tires

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
some time to test how well these tires

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.580 
some time to test how well these tires
could<00:06:27.669> maintain<00:06:28.210> traction<00:06:28.540> which<00:06:29.260> is<00:06:29.410> always

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
could maintain traction which is always

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
a problem in the rain for this car if I

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
wanted to on my last set of tires I

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.210 
wanted to on my last set of tires I
could<00:06:34.419> have<00:06:34.540> hit<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.110> gas<00:06:35.320> and<00:06:35.350> fourth<00:06:35.919> gear

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
could have hit the gas and fourth gear

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.100 
could have hit the gas and fourth gear
and<00:06:36.280> spun<00:06:36.850> them<00:06:37.030> I<00:06:37.240> tried<00:06:37.570> getting<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:37.870> super

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
and spun them I tried getting the super

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.780 
and spun them I tried getting the super
sports<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.500> do<00:06:38.620> that<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.010> wasn't<00:06:39.190> able<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.760> I

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.640 
sports to do that and wasn't able to I
was<00:06:40.090> even<00:06:40.330> having<00:06:40.600> a<00:06:40.690> hard<00:06:40.930> time<00:06:41.200> getting<00:06:41.440> the

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
was even having a hard time getting the

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.870 
was even having a hard time getting the
tires<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:42.130> spin<00:06:42.340> in<00:06:42.430> third

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
tires to spin in third

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.700 
tires to spin in third
I<00:06:42.910> even<00:06:43.060> tried<00:06:43.389> a<00:06:43.419> first<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:43.990> third<00:06:44.200> gear<00:06:44.410> pole

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
I even tried a first to third gear pole

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.530 
I even tried a first to third gear pole
and<00:06:44.950> was<00:06:45.040> able<00:06:45.250> to<00:06:45.400> get<00:06:45.520> traction<00:06:45.910> at<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.270> top

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
and was able to get traction at the top

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.210 
and was able to get traction at the top
of<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.780> second<00:06:47.200> all<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.530> way<00:06:47.650> through<00:06:47.950> third

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
the wet traction these tires have is

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.960 
the wet traction these tires have is
insane<00:06:55.770> as<00:06:56.770> you<00:06:56.979> can<00:06:57.100> probably<00:06:57.280> tell<00:06:57.550> we<00:06:57.729> love

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
insane as you can probably tell we love

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.110 
insane as you can probably tell we love

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
a league of their own michelin is really

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.890 
a league of their own michelin is really
set<00:07:05.650> a<00:07:05.680> benchmark<00:07:06.280> for<00:07:06.340> what

high-performance<00:07:07.900> summer<00:07:08.140> tires<00:07:08.440> should<00:07:08.590> be

high-performance summer tires should be

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.010 
high-performance summer tires should be
I<00:07:09.190> guess<00:07:09.430> the<00:07:09.460> only<00:07:09.850> complaint<00:07:10.270> is<00:07:10.479> is<00:07:10.840> that

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
I guess the only complaint is is that

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.960 
I guess the only complaint is is that
they<00:07:11.470> are<00:07:11.530> rather<00:07:11.770> expensive<00:07:12.250> if<00:07:12.550> we<00:07:12.669> paid

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
they are rather expensive if we paid

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.719 
they are rather expensive if we paid
including<00:07:13.960> installation<00:07:14.530> about<00:07:14.770> $1,000<00:07:15.520> for

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
including installation about $1,000 for

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.730 
including installation about $1,000 for
these<00:07:15.880> and<00:07:16.180> that<00:07:16.360> can<00:07:16.690> go<00:07:16.810> up<00:07:17.110> depending<00:07:17.680> on

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
these and that can go up depending on

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.580 
these and that can go up depending on
how<00:07:17.890> wide<00:07:18.130> the<00:07:18.340> tire<00:07:18.550> is<00:07:18.880> however<00:07:19.780> Michelin

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
how wide the tire is however Michelin

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.920 
how wide the tire is however Michelin
has<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:21.250> six<00:07:21.729> year<00:07:21.970> or<00:07:22.120> thirty<00:07:22.300> thousand<00:07:22.810> mile

has a six year or thirty thousand mile
warranty<00:07:22.960> on<00:07:23.560> them<00:07:23.770> and<00:07:24.070> this<00:07:24.789> is<00:07:24.850> pretty<00:07:25.360> high

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
warranty on them and this is pretty high

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.770 
warranty on them and this is pretty high
for<00:07:26.020> a<00:07:26.169> summer<00:07:26.410> tire<00:07:26.710> so<00:07:27.250> if<00:07:27.520> we<00:07:27.789> can<00:07:28.090> reach

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
for a summer tire so if we can reach

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.779 
for a summer tire so if we can reach
that<00:07:28.810> number<00:07:29.410> then<00:07:29.710> we'll<00:07:29.919> ultimately<00:07:30.220> be

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
that number then we'll ultimately be

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.670 
that number then we'll ultimately be
pretty<00:07:31.090> happy<00:07:31.300> with<00:07:31.539> our<00:07:31.660> purchase<00:07:31.870> we<00:07:32.560> hope
