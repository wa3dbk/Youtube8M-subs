00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
more again we're playing very simple

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.539 
more again we're playing very simple
things<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.449> we're<00:01:02.600> using<00:01:02.870> strategic<00:01:03.710> effects

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
things but we're using strategic effects

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.270 
things but we're using strategic effects
to<00:01:05.479> let<00:01:05.659> them<00:01:05.810> sit<00:01:06.080> in<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.260> track<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.590> provide

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
to let them sit in the track and provide

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.710 
to let them sit in the track and provide
some<00:01:07.430> interest<00:01:07.850> over<00:01:07.970> an<00:01:08.090> otherwise<00:01:08.360> kind<00:01:08.570> of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
some interest over an otherwise kind of

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.170 
some interest over an otherwise kind of
basic<00:01:09.200> Rock<00:01:09.619> groove<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.600> start<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:13.790> looks

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
basic Rock groove so we start this looks

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.580 
basic Rock groove so we start this looks
like<00:01:14.330> a<00:01:14.390> D<00:01:14.780> chord<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:15.740> actually<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.159> G<00:01:16.520> and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
like a D chord but it's actually a G and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.480 
like a D chord but it's actually a G and
we<00:01:18.590> go<00:01:18.799> between<00:01:19.720> this<00:01:20.740> major<00:01:21.740> pattern<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
we go between this major pattern and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.359 
we go between this major pattern and
then<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.790> kind<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.030> sus<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:25.100> really<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
then this kind of sus it's really a

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.100 
then this kind of sus it's really a
substitute<00:01:25.880> for<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> four<00:01:26.299> chord<00:01:26.600> over<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
substitute for the four chord over the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.790 
substitute for the four chord over the
track<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.270> then

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.010 

then<00:01:34.640> I'm<00:01:34.760> using<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> whammy<00:01:35.390> bar<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.840> there

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
then I'm using the whammy bar in there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740 
then I'm using the whammy bar in there
too<00:01:36.200> whenever<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.620> go<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.270> kind

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
too whenever I go to this this is a kind

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.950 
too whenever I go to this this is a kind
of<00:01:38.780> 5<00:01:39.050> chord<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.410> g5<00:01:39.740> chord<00:01:40.690> use<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.780> whammy

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
of 5 chord to g5 chord use the whammy

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:55.090 
of 5 chord to g5 chord use the whammy
bar<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.260> shake<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> little<00:01:42.740> bit<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:54.100> that's

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
bar to shake it a little bit so that's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.500 
bar to shake it a little bit so that's
really<00:01:55.310> all<00:01:55.520> you're<00:01:55.670> doing<00:01:55.940> until<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.300> get<00:01:56.390> to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
really all you're doing until we get to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
really all you're doing until we get to
the<00:01:56.600> end<00:01:56.750> which<00:01:56.900> I'll<00:01:57.020> show<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.410> minute

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the end which I'll show you in a minute

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.060 
the end which I'll show you in a minute
but<00:01:58.370> I<00:01:58.790> have<00:01:59.540> like<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.230> last<00:02:00.440> one<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.890> this

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
but I have like the last one like this

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.590 
but I have like the last one like this
one<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> dotted<00:02:04.610> 8th<00:02:04.820> ping-pong<00:02:05.420> delay

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
one I have a dotted 8th ping-pong delay

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.720 
one I have a dotted 8th ping-pong delay
so<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.870> took<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.200> same<00:02:06.530> delay<00:02:06.890> except<00:02:07.550> for<00:02:07.670> I

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
so I took that same delay except for I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.380 
so I took that same delay except for I
took<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.570> I<00:02:09.020> took<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.320> high<00:02:09.500> cut<00:02:09.920> off<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.150> that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
took the I took the high cut off so that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.590 
took the I took the high cut off so that
all<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.780> highs<00:02:12.850> here<00:02:13.850> are<00:02:14.000> teeny<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.390> delay

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
all the highs here are teeny that delay

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.030 
all the highs here are teeny that delay
sounds<00:02:16.600> there's<00:02:17.600> there's<00:02:18.110> more<00:02:18.410> high<00:02:18.590> end<00:02:18.830> on

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
sounds there's there's more high end on

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.880 
sounds there's there's more high end on
there<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.760> cut<00:02:20.630> out<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> low<00:02:21.080> end<00:02:21.320> so

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
there and then I cut out the low end so

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.370 
there and then I cut out the low end so
with<00:02:22.460> any<00:02:22.610> doll<00:02:22.910> or<00:02:23.180> any<00:02:23.360> any<00:02:23.570> delay<00:02:23.930> effect

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
with any doll or any any delay effect

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.910 
with any doll or any any delay effect
plug-in<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.490> 11<00:02:26.240> rag<00:02:26.390> line<00:02:26.660> 6<00:02:26.990> pod<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.830> know

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
plug-in or 11 rag line 6 pod you know

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.730 
plug-in or 11 rag line 6 pod you know
any<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.190> those<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.490> can<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.410> do<00:02:30.560> this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
any of those you can do you can do this

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.900 
any of those you can do you can do this
kind<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.980> thing<00:02:31.600> but<00:02:32.600> again<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.580> don't<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.760> any

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
kind of thing but again I don't have any

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.860 
kind of thing but again I don't have any
high<00:02:35.120> cut<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.740> have<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> low<00:02:37.490> cut<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.750> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
high cut on and I have a low cut so it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.690 
high cut on and I have a low cut so it
makes<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.170> sound<00:02:39.320> tinny<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.040> accentuates<00:02:40.370> my

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
makes it sound tinny it accentuates my

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.030 
makes it sound tinny it accentuates my
strumming<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.330> then<00:02:41.870> I'm<00:02:41.989> strumming<00:02:45.040> again

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
strumming and then I'm strumming again

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440 
strumming and then I'm strumming again
I'm<00:02:46.250> strumming<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.850> wid<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.239> dotted

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
I'm strumming kind of wid that dotted

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.180 
I'm strumming kind of wid that dotted
eighth<00:02:47.630> delay<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.140> only<00:02:48.380> hear<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.920> dotted

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
eighth delay so you only hear the dotted

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.060 
eighth delay so you only hear the dotted
eighth<00:02:49.310> effect<00:02:49.880> as<00:02:50.239> it's<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.440> separate

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
eighth effect as it's as a separate

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
entity sort of unless you're listening

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.430 
entity sort of unless you're listening
for<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.590> stereo<00:02:54.890> spectrum<00:02:55.370> or<00:02:55.550> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
for the stereo spectrum or I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.840 
for the stereo spectrum or I
intentionally<00:02:57.440> deviate<00:02:58.100> with<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.370> rhythm<00:02:58.670> and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
intentionally deviate with my rhythm and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.630 
intentionally deviate with my rhythm and
the<00:02:59.300> deviation<00:02:59.600> here<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:03.310> those<00:03:04.310> two

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the deviation here is this those two

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.850 
the deviation here is this those two
notes<00:03:04.940> are<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.480> down<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.530> strum<00:03:06.830> that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
notes are the down and up strum that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.800 
notes are the down and up strum that
comes<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.430> little<00:03:07.489> faster

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.390 

you<00:03:14.810> hear<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.200> stand<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.190> only

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
you hear that stand out and you only

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.780 
you hear that stand out and you only
hear<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.910> delay<00:03:17.060> when<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.050> happens<00:03:18.730> when<00:03:19.730> I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
hear the delay when that happens when I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.090 
hear the delay when that happens when I
do<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:19.970> fast<00:03:20.300> strum<00:03:20.800> again<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> can't

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
do that fast strum again I can't

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.350 
do that fast strum again I can't
emphasize<00:03:22.520> this<00:03:22.550> enough<00:03:22.790> when<00:03:23.060> you're<00:03:23.180> using

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
emphasize this enough when you're using

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.870 
emphasize this enough when you're using
a<00:03:23.540> lot<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:23.780> effects<00:03:24.110> if<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.760> way

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
a lot of effects if you can with the way

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.790 
a lot of effects if you can with the way
you're<00:03:26.090> playing<00:03:26.380> strategically<00:03:27.380> hide<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
you're playing strategically hide the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.500 
you're playing strategically hide the
effect<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:28.730> bring<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.090> out<00:03:29.210> when<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
effect and then bring it out when you

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.150 
effect and then bring it out when you
want<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.110> strategic<00:03:30.380> strumming<00:03:31.040> your

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
want to with strategic strumming your

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.190 
want to with strategic strumming your
note<00:03:31.310> placement<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.420> really<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:33.020> cool

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
note placement it's really really cool

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.650 
note placement it's really really cool
now<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.860> also<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.430> some<00:03:34.730> reverb<00:03:35.030> on<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.330> one

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
now I also have some reverb on this one

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.630 
now I also have some reverb on this one
whereas<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.350> didn't<00:03:36.800> for<00:03:37.730> our<00:03:37.850> octave<00:03:38.210> line<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
whereas I didn't for our octave line and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.010 
whereas I didn't for our octave line and
we're<00:03:40.640> playing<00:03:40.850> over<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.270> know<00:03:41.390> some<00:03:41.600> basic

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
we're playing over you know some basic

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.560 
we're playing over you know some basic
rhythm<00:03:42.650> cords<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.400> dry<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.180> figured

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
rhythm cords that are dry so I figured

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.630 
rhythm cords that are dry so I figured
since<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.080> don't<00:03:45.140> have<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.680> reverb<00:03:46.040> element<00:03:46.490> here

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
since I don't have a reverb element here

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.100 
since I don't have a reverb element here
I<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.910> kind<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.150> herb<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.660> up<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.930> it'll

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
I can kind of herb this one up and it'll

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.260 
I can kind of herb this one up and it'll
be<00:03:48.200> cool<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.280> last<00:03:49.610> effect<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.090> have<00:03:50.240> on

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
be cool now the last effect I have on

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.820 
be cool now the last effect I have on
here<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:52.730> phaser<00:03:53.140> it's<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.230> model<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:54.800> a

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
here is a phaser it's a model of like a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.100 
here is a phaser it's a model of like a
phase<00:03:55.100> 90<00:03:55.280> type<00:03:55.670> plug-in<00:03:56.090> but<00:03:56.780> I've<00:03:56.870> got<00:03:57.080> it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
phase 90 type plug-in but I've got it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.620 
phase 90 type plug-in but I've got it
synced<00:03:57.710> to<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> quarter<00:03:59.060> note<00:04:01.240> so<00:04:02.240> when<00:04:02.510> you're

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
synced to a quarter note so when you're

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.450 
synced to a quarter note so when you're
playing<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:02.990> 90<00:04:03.260> beats<00:04:03.380> per<00:04:03.500> minute<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
playing at 90 beats per minute the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.720 
playing at 90 beats per minute the
phaser<00:04:04.730> does<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> repetition<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.960> its<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:07.550> its

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
phaser does a repetition of its of its

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.970 
phaser does a repetition of its of its
phase<00:04:07.940> effect<00:04:08.300> every<00:04:08.990> quarter<00:04:09.290> note<00:04:09.440> it's

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
phase effect every quarter note it's

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.650 
phase effect every quarter note it's
slower<00:04:10.490> than<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.910> dotted<00:04:11.210> eighth<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.570> it

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
slower than the dotted eighth and it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.300 
slower than the dotted eighth and it
provides<00:04:12.140> some<00:04:12.260> smoothness<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.160> can

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
provides some smoothness but you can

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.280 
provides some smoothness but you can
definitely<00:04:13.460> hear<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.720> know<00:04:14.840> doing<00:04:15.170> its

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
definitely hear it you know doing its

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.690 
definitely hear it you know doing its
phaser<00:04:15.530> thing<00:04:17.950> why<00:04:18.950> did<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.100> choose<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.370> phaser

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
phaser thing why did I choose a phaser

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.680 
phaser thing why did I choose a phaser
well<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.360> think<00:04:20.840> phaser<00:04:21.850> sounds<00:04:22.850> sound<00:04:23.360> really

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
well I think phaser sounds sound really

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.480 
well I think phaser sounds sound really
good<00:04:23.900> with<00:04:24.050> really<00:04:24.320> rhythmic<00:04:24.800> parts<00:04:25.220> like

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
good with really rhythmic parts like

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.370 
good with really rhythmic parts like
this<00:04:25.730> now<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.390> don't<00:04:26.570> want<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.780> overuse<00:04:27.200> this

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
this now you don't want to overuse this

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.050 
this now you don't want to overuse this
kind<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.650> thing<00:04:27.860> but<00:04:28.220> remember<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.730> rest<00:04:28.910> of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
kind of thing but remember the rest of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.780 
kind of thing but remember the rest of
the<00:04:29.150> track<00:04:29.390> right<00:04:29.570> now<00:04:29.750> is<00:04:29.930> dry<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.040> can<00:04:31.340> use

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
the track right now is dry so I can use

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.270 
the track right now is dry so I can use
this<00:04:32.420> kind<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.750> wet<00:04:32.990> sound<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:34.010> really

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
this kind of wet sound and it really

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.450 
this kind of wet sound and it really
really<00:04:34.460> fits<00:04:34.850> well<00:04:35.150> alright<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.530> couple

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
really fits well alright so a couple

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.870 
really fits well alright so a couple
more<00:04:37.700> things<00:04:37.820> playing<00:04:38.150> technique-wise<00:04:38.600> I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
more things playing technique-wise I

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.650 
more things playing technique-wise I
added<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> bar<00:04:41.180> in<00:04:41.390> there<00:04:42.910> again<00:04:43.910> because<00:04:44.300> if

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
added the bar in there again because if

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.990 
added the bar in there again because if
I'm<00:04:45.260> letting<00:04:45.590> if<00:04:45.800> I'm<00:04:45.950> playing<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.700> delay

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
I'm letting if I'm playing to that delay

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.230 
I'm letting if I'm playing to that delay
or<00:04:47.150> for<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.570> delay<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:49.700> put<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.030> in

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
or for that delay and I put that in

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.870 
or for that delay and I put that in
there<00:04:50.420> you're<00:04:50.870> gonna<00:04:50.990> hear<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.880> phased

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
there you're gonna hear that phased

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.290 
there you're gonna hear that phased
whammy<00:04:53.690> bar<00:04:54.020> kind<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.320> warble<00:04:54.740> II<00:04:54.830> sound<00:04:55.300> after

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
whammy bar kind of warble II sound after

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.860 
whammy bar kind of warble II sound after
I<00:04:57.170> go<00:04:58.040> back<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.430> play<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.610> chord<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.420> it<00:04:59.570> helps

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
I go back and play a chord so it helps

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.660 
I go back and play a chord so it helps
me<00:05:00.020> diverge<00:05:00.440> from<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.680> delay<00:05:00.980> in<00:05:01.100> a<00:05:01.160> strategic

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
me diverge from the delay in a strategic

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.750 
me diverge from the delay in a strategic
place<00:05:01.880> and<00:05:02.240> create<00:05:02.810> some<00:05:02.990> interest<00:05:03.640> when<00:05:04.640> you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
place and create some interest when you

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.270 
place and create some interest when you
add<00:05:04.910> stuff<00:05:05.150> like<00:05:05.450> this<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.230> again<00:05:07.130> you're

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
add stuff like this and again you're

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.070 
add stuff like this and again you're
playing<00:05:07.550> for<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.180> delay<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.510> with<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.810> delay

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
playing for the delay and with the delay

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.450 
playing for the delay and with the delay
and<00:05:09.380> bringing<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.800> out<00:05:09.920> when<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.160> want<00:05:10.370> to

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
and bringing it out when you want to

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.200 
and bringing it out when you want to
this<00:05:11.270> helps<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.810> say<00:05:12.530> more<00:05:12.860> with<00:05:13.460> only<00:05:13.760> with

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
this helps you say more with only with

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.270 
this helps you say more with only with
playing<00:05:14.540> less<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:15.230> lot<00:05:15.740> of<00:05:15.830> times<00:05:15.980> when<00:05:16.160> we're

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
playing less a lot of times when we're

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.100 
playing less a lot of times when we're
layering<00:05:16.460> parts<00:05:17.000> we<00:05:17.450> think<00:05:17.660> we<00:05:17.750> need<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.960> add

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
we go to that a flat I come up here and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.680 
we go to that a flat I come up here and
I<00:05:40.910> do<00:05:40.970> a<00:05:41.060> double<00:05:41.390> stop<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.870> then<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.660> take<00:05:44.660> my

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
I do a double stop and then I take my

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.430 
I do a double stop and then I take my
bar<00:05:46.240> then<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.270> played<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.630> top<00:05:47.840> half<00:05:48.110> of

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
bar then I played the top half of

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.140 
bar then I played the top half of
another<00:05:48.650> G<00:05:49.010> chord<00:05:49.250> that's<00:05:49.580> really<00:05:49.880> all<00:05:50.000> I'm

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:48.160 

let's<00:06:20.509> hear<00:06:20.660> it<00:06:20.690> again<00:06:20.750> with<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.080> track

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.090 

with<00:06:49.170> a<00:06:49.200> line<00:06:49.470> like<00:06:49.680> this<00:06:49.710> it's<00:06:50.040> really

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
with a line like this it's really

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.310 
with a line like this it's really
important<00:06:50.700> that<00:06:50.730> you're<00:06:50.940> in<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.150> pocket<00:06:51.540> if

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
important that you're in the pocket if

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.560 
important that you're in the pocket if
you<00:06:52.830> start<00:06:53.310> to<00:06:53.520> push<00:06:53.970> too<00:06:54.240> much<00:06:56.240> your<00:06:57.240> delay

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
you start to push too much your delay

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.480 
you start to push too much your delay
starts<00:06:57.870> getting<00:06:58.110> off<00:06:58.350> if<00:06:58.620> you<00:06:58.740> drag<00:06:59.100> too<00:06:59.310> much

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
starts getting off if you drag too much

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.250 
starts getting off if you drag too much
your<00:06:59.790> delay<00:07:00.060> gets<00:07:00.330> off<00:07:00.540> that's<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.200> other

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
your delay gets off that's the other

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.960 
your delay gets off that's the other
cool<00:07:01.500> thing<00:07:01.710> about<00:07:01.740> playing<00:07:02.160> a<00:07:02.340> dotted<00:07:02.760> eighth

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
cool thing about playing a dotted eighth

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.780 
cool thing about playing a dotted eighth
delay<00:07:03.390> while<00:07:04.350> you're<00:07:04.500> emphasizing<00:07:04.790> the

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
delay while you're emphasizing the

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.180 
delay while you're emphasizing the
dotted<00:07:06.240> eighth<00:07:06.480> sound<00:07:07.140> is<00:07:07.440> you<00:07:07.590> can<00:07:07.740> tell<00:07:07.980> when

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
dotted eighth sound is you can tell when

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.650 
dotted eighth sound is you can tell when
you're<00:07:08.310> locked<00:07:08.520> in<00:07:08.700> because<00:07:08.820> you<00:07:09.090> won't<00:07:09.270> hear

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
you're locked in because you won't hear

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.450 
you're locked in because you won't hear
it<00:07:09.690> until<00:07:10.440> you<00:07:10.530> start<00:07:10.800> doing<00:07:10.830> something<00:07:11.190> that

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
it until you start doing something that

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.310 
it until you start doing something that
deviates<00:07:11.850> from<00:07:11.940> that<00:07:12.090> pattern<00:07:12.600> now<00:07:12.990> we've<00:07:13.170> got

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
deviates from that pattern now we've got

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.720 
deviates from that pattern now we've got
