least I didn't do it intentionally what
it<00:02:57.440> happened<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:58.010> it'll<00:02:58.609> be<00:02:58.670> interesting<00:02:58.790> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it happened so it'll be interesting to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.059 
it happened so it'll be interesting to
see<00:02:59.120> how<00:02:59.569> NASCAR<00:03:00.049> reacts<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.590> they<00:03:00.890> have

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
see how NASCAR reacts to it they have

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.770 
see how NASCAR reacts to it they have
the<00:03:01.099> ball<00:03:01.400> they're<00:03:02.209> going<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:02.390> allow<00:03:02.510> people

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
the ball they're going to allow people

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.539 
the ball they're going to allow people
to<00:03:02.900> intentionally<00:03:03.500> wreck<00:03:03.650> each<00:03:03.680> other<00:03:04.069> that

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
to intentionally wreck each other that

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.759 
to intentionally wreck each other that
tracks<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.090> fast<00:03:05.359> we<00:03:06.079> will<00:03:06.230> hurt<00:03:06.410> someone

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
tracks this fast we will hurt someone

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.860 
tracks this fast we will hurt someone
either<00:03:07.099> in<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.819> cars<00:03:08.030> or<00:03:08.239> in<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.389> grandstand

either in the cars or in the grandstand

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.900 
either in the cars or in the grandstand
so<00:03:09.139> it's<00:03:09.889> not<00:03:10.069> cool<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.400> intentionally<00:03:10.790> wreck

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910
