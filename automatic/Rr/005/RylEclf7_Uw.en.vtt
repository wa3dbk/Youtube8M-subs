mm-hmm but that's not the only thing
also<00:02:57.110> building<00:02:57.680> blocks<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.730> take<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> look

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
also building blocks if we take a look

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.650 
also building blocks if we take a look
in<00:02:59.330> our<00:02:59.450> inventory<00:02:59.840> right<00:03:00.350> here<00:03:00.740> got<00:03:01.370> 3d<00:03:02.360> of

course you cannot really make stone 3d
ish<00:03:05.270> but<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:06.110> example<00:03:06.590> would<00:03:06.950> let's<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.610> get

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
ish but for example would let's just get

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.160 
ish but for example would let's just get
some<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.940> what<00:03:10.940> else<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.480> there<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
new blocks as well bookshelves we might

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.870 
new blocks as well bookshelves we might
take<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.360> look<00:03:14.600> at<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.870> also<00:03:15.709> some<00:03:16.040> slabs<00:03:16.430> and

let's take a look at that one and also

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.770 
let's take a look at that one and also
I've<00:03:29.930> seen<00:03:30.230> another<00:03:30.760> another<00:03:31.760> version<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
I've seen another another version of the

I've seen another another version of the
hay<00:03:32.959> bales<00:03:33.200> but<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.860> don't<00:03:34.160> think<00:03:34.400> it's

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
hay bales but I don't think it's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.880 
hay bales but I don't think it's
included<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.330> this<00:03:35.540> pack<00:03:35.810> right<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.440> this

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
included in this pack right now and this

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.860 
included in this pack right now and this
is<00:03:37.070> not<00:03:37.220> because<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.880> pack<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.450> glitch

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
is not because of the pack this glitch

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.720 
is not because of the pack this glitch
it<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.410> because<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.040> snapshot<00:03:40.519> that<00:03:40.550> I

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
it is because of the snapshot that I

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.390 
it is because of the snapshot that I
mean<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.420> kind<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.900> weird<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.530> yeah<00:03:43.100> you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
mean it's kind of weird so yeah you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.420 
mean it's kind of weird so yeah you
better<00:03:43.430> be<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.690> snapshot<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.860> for

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
better be in a snapshot that is for

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.330 
better be in a snapshot that is for
example<00:03:46.820> 27<00:03:47.300> B<00:03:47.540> or<00:03:47.750> if<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.110> video<00:03:48.410> comes<00:03:49.100> out

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
example 27 B or if this video comes out

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.210 
example 27 B or if this video comes out
at<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.850> point<00:03:50.150> where<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.769> new<00:03:52.190> a

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
at a point where there is a new a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.370 
at a point where there is a new a
snapshot<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.910> should<00:03:53.120> try<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.690> then

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
snapshot you should try that and then

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.710 
snapshot you should try that and then
you<00:03:54.560> won't<00:03:54.800> get<00:03:55.040> these<00:03:55.280> glitches<00:03:55.550> but<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.180> the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
you won't get these glitches but in the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.170 
you won't get these glitches but in the
newer<00:03:57.200> version<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:57.980> pack<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.459> think<00:03:58.700> there

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
newer version of this pack I think there

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.949 
newer version of this pack I think there
was<00:03:59.390> even<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.590> hay<00:04:01.070> bale<00:04:01.370> three<00:04:02.120> years<00:04:02.540> but

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
was even this hay bale three years but

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.810 
was even this hay bale three years but
