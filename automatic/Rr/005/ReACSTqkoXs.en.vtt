it's<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> small<00:00:17.820> group<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.210> whether<00:00:18.510> it's

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it's with a small group or whether it's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.450 
it's with a small group or whether it's
a<00:00:18.810> big<00:00:19.050> field<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.619> think<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.160> really

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a big field I think it's really

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220 
a big field I think it's really
important<00:00:20.910> especially<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.510> everybody<00:00:22.109> in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
important especially for everybody in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
important especially for everybody in
the<00:00:22.320> Midwest<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:22.890> you're<00:00:22.980> trying<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> cat<00:00:23.519> up

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the Midwest if you're trying to cat up

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.849 
the Midwest if you're trying to cat up
or<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.150> move<00:00:24.570> further<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> sport<00:00:25.500> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
or get move further on in the sport you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
or get move further on in the sport you
really<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.430> figure<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> sprint

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
really have to figure out how to sprint

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
really have to figure out how to sprint
now<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.740> major<00:00:29.250> big

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
now you don't have to have major big

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.150 
now you don't have to have major big
power<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.240> an<00:00:30.390> Andre<00:00:30.810> Greipel<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> tour

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
power like an Andre Greipel or a tour

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610 
power like an Andre Greipel or a tour
hosh<00:00:32.369> off<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.020> effective

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
hosh off you can be very very effective

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.380 
hosh off you can be very very effective
in<00:00:34.710> terms<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> sprinting<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.820> less<00:00:36.120> power

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
in terms of sprinting with less power

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
in terms of sprinting with less power
but<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.500> focusing<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.250> your

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but really really focusing on your

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
but really really focusing on your
position<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.969> where<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.360> where<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.780> start

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
position and where you where you start

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
position and where you where you start
your<00:00:40.200> sprint<00:00:40.500> from<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> come<00:00:41.579> off

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
your sprint from and where you come off

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
your sprint from and where you come off
of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> wheel<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:42.840> ultimately<00:00:43.140> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
of the wheel so I think ultimately just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220 
of the wheel so I think ultimately just
like<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> tactics<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.030> 1<00:00:45.210> position<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
like in tactics part 1 position is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
like in tactics part 1 position is
everything<00:00:46.860> investing<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.879> energy<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
everything investing your energy and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
everything investing your energy and
putting<00:00:49.170> yourself<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> position<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.309> do

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
putting yourself in a position to do

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.310 
putting yourself in a position to do
well<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> hanging<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> wheel<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
well and hanging on to that wheel in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
well and hanging on to that wheel in
front<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> until<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.190> cross<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.430> finish

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
front of you until you cross that finish

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
front of you until you cross that finish
line<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.930> better<00:00:54.960> tactic<00:00:55.739> than<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
line that's a much better tactic than to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
line that's a much better tactic than to
start<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.940> back<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> big

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
start way way back and have this big

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
start way way back and have this big
explosive<00:00:58.500> sprint<00:00:58.949> where<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> pass<00:00:59.309> five<00:00:59.579> or

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
explosive sprint where you pass five or

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
explosive sprint where you pass five or
six<00:00:59.910> people<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.300> still<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.780> 10th<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.170> 12th

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
six people and still get 10th or 12th

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
six people and still get 10th or 12th
place<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.399> we're<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.699> talk<00:01:02.879> about

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
place so we're going to talk about

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
place so we're going to talk about
really<00:01:03.690> setting<00:01:04.199> yourself<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
really setting yourself up and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
positioning yourself well to have a good

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
positioning yourself well to have a good
sprint<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:08.460> tell<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.720> look<00:01:09.900> at

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
sprint I can tell you this you look at

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
sprint I can tell you this you look at
some<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> greatest<00:01:10.530> sprinters<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
about focusing on and dialing in the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
about focusing on and dialing in the
perfect<00:01:17.759> position<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.630> they're<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
perfect position because they're not in

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.600 
perfect position because they're not in
good<00:01:19.229> position<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> doesn't<00:01:19.950> matter<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.280> fast

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
good position it doesn't matter how fast

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.980 
good position it doesn't matter how fast
they<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.939> they're<00:01:21.420> never<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> win<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
they are they're never going to win a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
they are they're never going to win a
bike<00:01:22.140> race<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.009> let's<00:01:23.159> start<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bike race so let's start off with the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
bike race so let's start off with the
basics<00:01:24.200> getting<00:01:25.200> yourself<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:25.710> position

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
basics getting yourself into position

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
basics getting yourself into position
with<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.549> three<00:01:26.820> kilometers<00:01:27.390> left<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with two or three kilometers left in the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
with two or three kilometers left in the
race<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.229> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.829> times<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> Midwest<00:01:30.180> here

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
race a lot of times in the Midwest here

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.819 
race a lot of times in the Midwest here
we<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> criteriums<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> they're<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
we have criteriums and they're about a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
we have criteriums and they're about a
mile<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> mile<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> half<00:01:33.119> circuits

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
mile to a mile and a half circuits

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
mile to a mile and a half circuits
getting<00:01:34.200> yourself<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.680> position<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.400> two<00:01:35.610> or

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
getting yourself in position with two or

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
getting yourself in position with two or
three<00:01:35.970> laps<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.540> being<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.710> ten

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
three laps to go being in that top ten

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
three laps to go being in that top ten
and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:38.939> lap<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.479> being<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and then with one lap to go being in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
and then with one lap to go being in
that<00:01:40.350> top<00:01:40.619> five<00:01:40.920> position<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.850> there's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that top five position because there's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.130 
that top five position because there's
all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> turns<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> different<00:01:42.930> things<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
all the turns and different things like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
all the turns and different things like
that<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.250> safer<00:01:44.549> bet<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that you're a much safer bet to be in

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
that you're a much safer bet to be in
that<00:01:45.420> top<00:01:45.689> five<00:01:45.930> position<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> spring<00:01:47.100> from

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that top five position and spring from

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
that top five position and spring from
there<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> trying<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> make<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> bunch

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
there then it trying to make up a bunch

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
there then it trying to make up a bunch
of<00:01:48.930> distance<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.409> last<00:01:49.680> lap<00:01:49.950> part<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
of distance in the last lap part of the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580 
of distance in the last lap part of the
reason<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.380> energy

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
reason is if you use all of your energy

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
reason is if you use all of your energy
moving<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.460> position<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:53.970> final<00:01:54.299> lap

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
moving into position in that final lap

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
moving into position in that final lap
you<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.229> energy<00:01:55.380> left<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> sprint

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you have no energy left for the sprint

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.249 
you have no energy left for the sprint
at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> end<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.360> you're<00:01:57.509> already<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:58.110> good

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
at the end but if you're already in good

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
at the end but if you're already in good
position<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.770> lap<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> you've

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
position with one lap to go and you've

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
position with one lap to go and you've
invested<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> our<00:02:00.450> energy<00:02:00.810> there<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
invested some of our energy there you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
invested some of our energy there you
can<00:02:01.590> almost<00:02:01.740> rest<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> last<00:02:02.790> lap<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> then

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
can almost rest that last lap and then

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420 
can almost rest that last lap and then
when<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.750> final<00:02:04.079> 200<00:02:04.439> meters<00:02:04.649> hit<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> gas

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
when that final 200 meters hit the gas

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
when that final 200 meters hit the gas
so<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:06.689> spend<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so really really really spend a lot of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
so really really really spend a lot of
time<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> lot<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.160> energy<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.729> experiment

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
time and a lot of energy and experiment

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
time and a lot of energy and experiment
a<00:02:09.629> lot<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.229> giving<00:02:10.590> yourself<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.069> perfect

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
a lot with giving yourself in perfect

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580 
a lot with giving yourself in perfect
position<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.450> lap<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.870> go

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
position with one lap to go

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
position with one lap to go
what<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.489> do<00:02:14.610> whenever<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> a

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
what I like to do whenever I go to a

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.089 
what I like to do whenever I go to a
course<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> first<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> look

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
course for the first time I like to look

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.220 
course for the first time I like to look
at<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> last<00:02:17.519> 500<00:02:17.940> meters<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.110> kind

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
at the last 500 meters and really kind

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.199 
at the last 500 meters and really kind
of<00:02:19.349> set<00:02:19.920> myself<00:02:20.069> up<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.580> always<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.910> practice

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
of set myself up I always do a practice

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.809 
of set myself up I always do a practice
lab<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.780> figure<00:02:22.319> out<00:02:22.349> at<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:22.709> point<00:02:23.310> am<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
lab and figure out at what point am I

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
lab and figure out at what point am I
going<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.030> start<00:02:24.300> my<00:02:24.420> sprint<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.260> in

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to start my sprint if I'm in

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.869 
going to start my sprint if I'm in
perfect<00:02:25.620> position<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.190> second<00:02:26.550> place<00:02:26.670> like

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
perfect position in second place like

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.369 
perfect position in second place like
Mark<00:02:27.120> Cavendish<00:02:27.330> always<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> Tour<00:02:28.290> de

Mark Cavendish always is in the Tour de

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.770 
Mark Cavendish always is in the Tour de
France<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> find<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> tree<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> post

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
France I like to find a tree or a post

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.380 
France I like to find a tree or a post
or<00:02:31.080> something<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.920> signifies<00:02:32.370> 150<00:02:33.120> meters

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
or something that signifies 150 meters

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.330 
or something that signifies 150 meters
to<00:02:33.510> go<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.930> when<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> hit<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> gas<00:02:34.680> if

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
to go so I know when to hit the gas if

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
to go so I know when to hit the gas if
I'm<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> little<00:02:35.849> further<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.299> fifth<00:02:36.599> or<00:02:36.720> sixth

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
I'm a little further back fifth or sixth

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.479 
I'm a little further back fifth or sixth
place<00:02:37.170> obviously<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.950> have<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.160> start<00:02:38.370> my

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
place obviously I have to start my

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.190 
place obviously I have to start my
sprint<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:38.970> bit<00:02:39.060> earlier<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.780> find<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
sprint a little bit earlier so I find a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.199 
sprint a little bit earlier so I find a
spot<00:02:40.440> maybe<00:02:40.590> 300<00:02:41.160> meters<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.580> where<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> think

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
spot maybe 300 meters out where I think

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.820 
spot maybe 300 meters out where I think
I<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:42.420> still<00:02:42.690> accelerate<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> finish

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I can still accelerate to the finish

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.039 
I can still accelerate to the finish
line<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.580> ultimately<00:02:45.000> guys<00:02:45.209> that's<00:02:45.510> that's

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
line but ultimately guys that's that's

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.990 
line but ultimately guys that's that's
that<00:02:46.290> final<00:02:46.739> step<00:02:46.980> getting<00:02:47.640> yourself<00:02:47.910> in

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that final step getting yourself in

that final step getting yourself in
position<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.540> knowing<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799

go<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.519> side<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> course<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.630> if

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
go what side of the course to be on if

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.420 
go what side of the course to be on if
there's<00:02:52.170> shade<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.829> side<00:02:53.069> if<00:02:53.220> there's

get into that position that's a really
good<00:03:09.930> move<00:03:10.110> that's<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.799> start<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
good move that's that's the start of the

position with more and more energy if

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.500 
position with more and more energy if
you<00:03:16.860> look<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.129> past<00:03:17.340> Tour<00:03:17.579> de<00:03:17.700> France<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.389> know

you look at past Tour de France you know
stages<00:03:18.870> by<00:03:18.989> Tyler<00:03:19.319> Farrar<00:03:19.500> he<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.340> started

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
stages by Tyler Farrar he really started

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
stages by Tyler Farrar he really started
off<00:03:20.819> getting<00:03:21.060> eights<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.690> nines<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.260> then

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
got to that position with more energy

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.530 
got to that position with more energy
and<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.889> full<00:03:32.130> tank<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.459> gas<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.700> hit<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> gas<00:03:33.269> so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
and a full tank of gas to hit the gas so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.449 
and a full tank of gas to hit the gas so
ultimately<00:03:33.810> guys<00:03:34.470> perfect<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> sprint

you're going to be you're going to do

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.479 
you're going to be you're going to do
much<00:03:37.139> better<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.590> terms<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.859> catting<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
much better in terms of catting up and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.920 
much better in terms of catting up and
different<00:03:38.700> things<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.060> invest<00:03:39.810> in

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
different things like that invest in

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.750 
different things like that invest in
your<00:03:39.989> position<00:03:40.470> invest<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.280> space<00:03:41.519> and

your position invest in that space and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.890 
your position invest in that space and
then<00:03:42.090> eventually<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.569> more<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.840> more

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
then eventually get more and more

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.479 
then eventually get more and more
efficient<00:03:43.319> at<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.950> who<00:03:44.040> knows<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.340> might

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
efficient at it and who knows you might

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.790 
efficient at it and who knows you might
win<00:03:44.609> some<00:03:44.760> races
