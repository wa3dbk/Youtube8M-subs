00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and you'll be able to create anything

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.230 
and you'll be able to create anything
you

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
and obviously as you progress through

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.370 
and obviously as you progress through
the<00:02:11.980> game<00:02:12.010> more<00:02:12.370> parts<00:02:12.700> are<00:02:12.820> opened<00:02:13.120> up<00:02:13.380> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the game more parts are opened up and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.170 
the game more parts are opened up and
also<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:15.220> will<00:02:15.430> provide<00:02:15.790> some<00:02:16.060> basic

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
also we will provide some basic

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.720 
also we will provide some basic
chasity's<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.080> simple<00:02:17.620> helpers<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.220> four

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
games one of the things that we fail

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.550 
games one of the things that we fail
especially<00:02:30.850> when<00:02:31.330> we<00:02:31.480> were<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:31.990> doing<00:02:32.380> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
especially when we were so doing the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.230 
especially when we were so doing the
characters<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.250> started<00:02:33.670> contain<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
characters we started contain the

characters we started contain the

traditional approach of making the next

smoothing<00:02:39.340> everything<00:02:39.400> off<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.990> fail

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
smoothing everything off but we fail

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.770 
smoothing everything off but we fail
that<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.010> took<00:02:42.790> away<00:02:43.030> some<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.480> world

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that that took away some of the world

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.680 
that that took away some of the world
the<00:02:44.200> appeal<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.800> we<00:02:45.700> had<00:02:45.880> from<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.270> n64

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the appeal and we had from the n64

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
the appeal and we had from the n64
character<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.710> end<00:02:47.770> we<00:02:47.860> went<00:02:48.160> for<00:02:48.370> a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
character so in the end we went for a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.730 
character so in the end we went for a
more<00:02:48.580> blocky<00:02:49.000> approach<00:02:49.300> with<00:02:50.140> Stowe<00:02:50.350> seems<00:02:50.530> to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
more blocky approach with Stowe seems to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.550 
more blocky approach with Stowe seems to
use<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> lot<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.220> triangles<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:53.410> very

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
use a lot of triangles but it's very

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.110 
use a lot of triangles but it's very
stateless<00:02:54.040> they<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.460> think<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.820> sort<00:02:55.060> of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
stateless they can I think it sort of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.630 
stateless they can I think it sort of
added<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.810> extra<00:02:55.840> emphasis<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.770> what<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
added that extra emphasis and what the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.700 
added that extra emphasis and what the
characters<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.270> them<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:58.600> kept<00:02:59.290> them<00:02:59.470> close

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
characters with them but kept them close

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.040 
characters with them but kept them close
to<00:03:00.040> where<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.520> from<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.880> well<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.330> for<00:03:01.990> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
to where the from as well and for the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.810 
to where the from as well and for the
backgrounds<00:03:02.680> we're<00:03:02.920> extending<00:03:03.520> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
backgrounds we're extending the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.940 
backgrounds we're extending the
constructed<00:03:04.360> theme<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:04.930> you'll<00:03:05.470> see<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:05.710> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
constructed theme so you'll see all the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.170 
constructed theme so you'll see all the
backgrounds<00:03:06.460> look<00:03:06.610> as<00:03:06.730> if<00:03:06.850> they're<00:03:06.970> being

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
backgrounds look as if they're being

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.850 
backgrounds look as if they're being
constructed<00:03:07.810> together<00:03:08.050> soon<00:03:08.320> together<00:03:08.680> from

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
constructed together soon together from

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.950 
constructed together soon together from

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
where that are a patchwork or hammer

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.930 
where that are a patchwork or hammer
together<00:03:11.380> from<00:03:11.650> scaffolding<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.760> also

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
together from scaffolding and it also

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.050 
together from scaffolding and it also
looks<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.420> be<00:03:13.540> quite<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.810> big<00:03:14.320> world<00:03:14.880> how<00:03:15.880> big

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
looks to be quite a big world how big

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.710 
looks to be quite a big world how big
exactly<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.980> kind<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.400> hard<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.850> put<00:03:19.600> an

larger than any other background that
really<00:03:27.340> has<00:03:27.430> produced<00:03:27.760> 16<00:03:28.450> larger<00:03:28.840> than<00:03:28.960> the

and again all the game worlds themselves
are<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:34.060> know<00:03:34.180> three<00:03:34.510> four<00:03:34.750> times<00:03:34.930> larger

are you know three four times larger
than<00:03:35.530> sort<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.280> other<00:03:36.430> assets<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.540> there<00:03:38.170> will

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
than sort of other assets and there will

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.530 
than sort of other assets and there will
also<00:03:38.380> be<00:03:38.500> some<00:03:38.950> kind<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.340> multiplayer<00:03:40.210> game

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
also be some kind of multiplayer game

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.140 
also be some kind of multiplayer game
right<00:03:40.720> yes<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:41.890> will<00:03:42.040> be<00:03:42.100> multiplayer<00:03:42.850> both

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
right yes there will be multiplayer both

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.570 
right yes there will be multiplayer both
on<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.540> same<00:03:43.570> box<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.350> over<00:03:44.950> life<00:03:45.160> what's

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
on the same box and over life what's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.960 
on the same box and over life what's
though<00:03:45.820> about<00:03:46.380> well<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.410> mean<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.190> can't<00:03:48.790> go<00:03:48.940> into

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
though about well I mean I can't go into

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.850 
though about well I mean I can't go into
too<00:03:49.300> much<00:03:49.330> details<00:03:49.870> about<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> live<00:03:50.410> but

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
too much details about the live but

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.470 
too much details about the live but
obviously<00:03:51.370> you'll<00:03:51.550> be<00:03:51.640> able<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.910> compete<00:03:52.270> or

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
obviously you'll be able to compete or

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.870 
obviously you'll be able to compete or
