00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.169
 hello welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.080
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.500
 make a super crepe paper flower 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.500
 easy 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.870
 materials that we're going to need a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.130
 crepe paper of any color 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:33.719
 clean pipes or wire and scissors 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.190
 fatalities for all we are going to begin 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.420
 we take the crepe paper and we are going to cut 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.059
 a strip of plus or minus 12 centimeters 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 we are going to open it and then go back to 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.370
 fold them into a fan 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.760
 keeping more or less a measure of 15 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.379
 centimeters 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.179
 that is, they are going to keep us 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.179
 15 x 12 rectangle 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:12.280
 we are going to fold them in a fan shape 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:14.230
 until having 5 rectangles once done 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 this is going to cut the edges that we 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.860
 they were united from both sides 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 This is a very simple craft but 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 It can be very nice accompanying 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 any gift we want to make 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.780
 now keeping all the rectangles 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.020
 together we are going to fold in the form of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 fan 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.600
 each fold will be one centimeter and 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.600
 medium 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.560
 if we give in the end 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's mark the center doubling what 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.730
 the middle and in the center we are going to place 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.410
 clean pipes we're going to screw you 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.410
 same in this way we are going to close it 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 once this is done we will open the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.950
 fans that were left on both sides 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.510
 and now being very careful we are going to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.500
 start raising each of the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.500
 little leaves up 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 one by one and reaching the end 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.560
 in the case that we want more 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.859
 bushy we simply add more his 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.859
 inks 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.880
 and once we get to the top with 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.920
 all the sheets with all the paper 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.720
 crepe we would be almost finished 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 we arrange a little so they come together 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 the parts that are separated and ready 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.170
 here you can see other colors of the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.170
 same flower 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.769
