would be too loose another way people
explain<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.080> should<00:02:48.110> not<00:02:48.440> be

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
explain it is that you should not be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.710 
explain it is that you should not be
able<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.950> pinch<00:02:49.280> any<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> strap<00:02:50.180> over<00:02:50.360> on

itself<00:02:51.110> when<00:02:51.680> checking<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> collarbone

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
itself when checking at the collarbone

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.030 
itself when checking at the collarbone
this<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.810> difficult<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.380> do<00:02:54.620> especially

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
this can be difficult to do especially

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.670 
this can be difficult to do especially
with<00:02:55.370> tinier<00:02:55.790> babies<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:56.959> often<00:02:57.319> easier

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
with tinier babies so it's often easier

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.880 
with tinier babies so it's often easier
