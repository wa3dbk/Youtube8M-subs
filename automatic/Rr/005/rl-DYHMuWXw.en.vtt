00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.680
 the spaceship earth version and distribution 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.680
 synapse 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.029
 is our spaceship welcome to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.779
 board for this one-year trip in 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.970
 around the sun the earth runs in its orbit 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.610
 for the winter solstice that we 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.390
 we will reach you within eleven weeks day 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.510
 December 21 what drives the earth 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.489
 forward is the momentum she received 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.470
 due to their training 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.809
 the laws of universal gravity were 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.010
 discoveries by isaac newton in the century 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.410
 17 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.660
 an apple would have fallen on 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.960
 his head and then he would have 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.300
 asked why the answer is because the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.390
 enormous mass of land attracts small 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.489
 Apple's mass is the pulling force 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.539
 yes but then why the moon does not fall on 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.829
 land and land inside the sun because 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.170
 force of attraction of the sun is 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.630
 counterbalanced by the force of inertia of 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.310
 land that alone would make her go on 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.670
 indefinitely in line path 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.670
 straight 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.850
 the land is in permanent flight but 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.860
 by the force of attraction of the sun and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 at the same time in permanent drop in 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.350
 direction of the sun saved from this 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.180
 force of inertia the earth's orbit is the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.510
 place where these forces are in 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.510
 balance 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.580
 is the mass of the sun that holds the earth 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:51.920
 its same thing to the moon to 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.920
 mass of the earth and has the moon in its orbit 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 its orbit is determined by equilibrium 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.539
 between the force of inertia that would 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.180
 take away the moon from the earth and 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.899
 attraction of the earth that alone would make moon 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.899
 fall on the ground 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.510
 the two venus planets and mars girÃ£o 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.310
 as we around the sun but with 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.019
 different speeds because your 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.019
 distance to the sun is different 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.489
 Venus is closer to the sun and earth 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 therefore the force of attraction of the sun is 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.790
 higher if venus does not fall into the sun is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.920
 because the forces of inertia that keep it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.290
 in orbit are also larger and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.340
 thrusts faster than 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.340
 earth in its orbit 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.560
 Mars is further from the sun 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.810
 furthermore mars is smaller and its mass 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.830
 constitutes only one-tenth of the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.290
 Earth 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.239
 the inertial attraction forces are more 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.099
 weak 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.930
 martin rotates more slowly in its orbit and 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.269
 it takes two years to complete a lap 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.610
 around the sun twice as long 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.890
 Earth 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.560
 so the earth and the planets each have 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 its orbit in balance between the force 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:20.120
 of attraction of the sun and the force of inertia 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:22.250
 also called centrifugal force is the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.879
 interaction of these two forces that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.790
 all in orbit but this balance does not 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.220
 is stable as the synchronized orbit of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.470
 a weather satellite that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.690
 around the earth at the same speed 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.450
 that the earth revolves around its axis 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.319
 to always shoot the same part 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.390
 her 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.760
 the streets of the solar system are also not 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.799
 synchronized with their planets our 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.169
 moon spins much more slowly around 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.359
 the Earth to the Moon moves away from the land far 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.519
 slightly three centimeters every year 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:56.260
 one day after a few billion years 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.260
 She'll maybe escape. 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.049
 on the contrary we were a big satellite of 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:15.439
 Mars spins so fast that the Martians 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.829
 if they existed they would see him pass three times 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.419
 per day 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.580
 satellites that rotate faster than 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.770
 your planet would still approach if 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.960
 accelerate like the stone that spins on the tip 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.100
 and the string which increases speed 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.100
 when string decreases 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.639
 the laws of gravitation do not provoke chaos 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.900
 we were going to end up disintegrating and 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.900
 crashing against martin 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.490
 we also suffer this force that attracts 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.490
 all to the center of the earth 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.530
 our life is an incessant effort to 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.300
 to withstand the pull of the earth 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.870
 when we want to get away from your 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.669
 the earth center generates so many forces 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.680
 attraction that all its parts are 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.520
 push to get closer 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.520
 from the center 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.199
 it forms a sphere we can 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.180
 liberate from the force of attraction of the earth 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.940
 if we reach the speed of 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.069
 release 40 thousand kilometers per hour 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.810
 to obtain such speed compensate the 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.219
 force of attraction of the earth the astronauts 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.380
 need very powerful rockets 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:33.289
 the moon is much less massive it has a 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.150
 weak attraction force to get out of it 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.130
 just a small rocket and a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.090
 release speed of 8 thousand 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.090
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.969
 the mass of the earth and our weight paste us 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:53.389
 in the sun while the land itself 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:55.400
 fluctuates heavily for this trip in 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.949
 around the sun we board a carousel 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.090
 that advancing completes a round in 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.889
 around its axis in a day and a night 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.229
 but because its axis is inclined to earth 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.810
 every day makes us go up and down 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.930
 thousands of kilometers in relation to 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.120
 plan of the planets in berlin paris 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.469
 london montreal new york 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.289
 you're near the 45th parallel 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.870
 every day you go up and down 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.180
 approximately 3 thousand kilometers 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.599
 Now it's autumn, it's the night we go up. 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.599
 high 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.830
 this course in roller coasters 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.830
 modifies our view of the sky 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.640
 we see the small moon crescent 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:50.030
 very low on the horizon maybe even 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:52.370
 hidden in the mist in spring 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.850
 contrary to the evening we will have very 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.850
 low 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.860
 hence the planets and the moon appear as 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.780
 on a steeper slope the 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.980
 small crescent appears higher in the 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:12.260
 sky in the spring we have better 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:14.270
 chances to see him more tonight and 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.010
 every autumn night you get the 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.010
 elevator to see the world from above 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.539
 until the next good trip program 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.539
 all in order
