00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
case itself is a two-piece ER so it has

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
case itself is a two-piece ER so it has
this<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:33.120> TPU<00:00:33.540> rubber<00:00:33.989> very<00:00:34.710> flexible<00:00:35.930> kind

make these kind of like impact pads
there's<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> little<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:52.850> depth

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there's just a little bit of depth

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
there's just a little bit of depth
differential<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:55.920> no

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
differential to them you know maybe no

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.360 
differential to them you know maybe no
more<00:00:56.430> than<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> sticker<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> piece

and<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> bottom<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.570> stick<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and the bottom are gonna stick out a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
and the bottom are gonna stick out a
little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.650> that'll<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.130> interesting<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
little bit so that'll be interesting and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.600 
little bit so that'll be interesting and
here's<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.590> speech<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.950> logo<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
here's where the the speech and logo is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.539 
here's where the the speech and logo is
also<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.740> visible<00:01:22.740> underneath<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
also going to be visible underneath the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
also going to be visible underneath the
kickstand<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.259> gonna<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.530> ahead

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
kickstand and then so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
kickstand and then so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> throw<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.119> really

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and just throw that on this is really

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
and just throw that on this is really
easy<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.710> rubber<00:01:29.009> piece<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.610> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
easy because the the rubber piece is so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
easy because the the rubber piece is so
flexible<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.530> slides<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.369> there

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
flexible so that just slides on there

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
flexible so that just slides on there
and<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.390> harder<00:01:33.960> outer

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and then you have this harder outer

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130 
and then you have this harder outer
plastic<00:01:35.130> shell<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.790> one's<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.150> gunmetal<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
plastic shell this one's in gunmetal it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
plastic shell this one's in gunmetal it
has<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> kickstand<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:39.229> actually<00:01:40.229> no

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
has a kickstand here which actually no

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
has a kickstand here which actually no
just<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.280> work<00:01:47.939> when

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
just so this is actually gonna work when

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
just so this is actually gonna work when
the<00:01:48.450> rubber<00:01:49.079> case<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.649> its<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.040> hold<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the rubber case is on its just hold in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.139 
the rubber case is on its just hold in
there<00:01:50.990> by<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> molded<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.520> it's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
there by the way it's molded and it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
there by the way it's molded and it's
gonna<00:01:54.270> snap<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.229> silver

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
gonna snap in there a little silver

kickstand<00:01:56.159> that's<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> cool<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.509> I'm

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
kickstand that's kind of cool so I'm

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the cutout and then what's pretty

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.320 
the cutout and then what's pretty
different<00:02:05.280> about<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.500> buttons

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
different about this is that the buttons

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
different about this is that the buttons
the<00:02:09.330> rubber<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> activate<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the rubber is going to activate the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.010 
the rubber is going to activate the
other<00:02:11.310> buttons<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> iPhone<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.930> they

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
other buttons for the iPhone and they

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.850 
other buttons for the iPhone and they
are<00:02:13.140> flush

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
are flush

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
are flush
one<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.490> reasons<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.270> gonna<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
one of the reasons and it's gonna be a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
one of the reasons and it's gonna be a
little<00:02:15.900> hard<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.350> there<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.010> these

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
little hard to see there but these

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.580 
little hard to see there but these
buttons<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:18.000> flush<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> way<00:02:19.230> across<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
buttons are flush all the way across and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
buttons are flush all the way across and
one<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.520> reasons<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.210> at<00:02:21.780> least<00:02:21.900> on

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
one of the reasons is that at least on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.890 
one of the reasons is that at least on
the<00:02:22.170> diagram<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.360> kickstand<00:02:24.780> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the diagram it's the the kickstand is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.410 
the diagram it's the the kickstand is
offset<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.740> want<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> really<00:02:26.420> vertical

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
offset so if you want a really vertical

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.420 
offset so if you want a really vertical
angle<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.050> orient<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.070> way<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.370> if

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
angle you can orient it this way and if

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
angle you can orient it this way and if
you<00:02:29.490> want<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:29.850> shallow<00:02:30.150> angle<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.630> can

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you want a really shallow angle you can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
you want a really shallow angle you can
orient<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.320> way<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.100> because<00:02:32.640> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
orient it this way and because it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.420 
orient it this way and because it's
gonna<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.060> sitting<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.920> presumably<00:02:34.920> your<00:02:35.130> desk

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
gonna be sitting on presumably your desk

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
gonna be sitting on presumably your desk
or<00:02:35.670> table<00:02:36.060> you're<00:02:36.630> gonna<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:37.080> these<00:02:37.230> buttons

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
or table you're gonna want these buttons

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.830 
or table you're gonna want these buttons
flush<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.130> I'm<00:02:38.280> pretty<00:02:38.880> curious<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.390> you're

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
here and here's the power button on the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.080 
here and here's the power button on the
side<00:02:48.810> I'm<00:02:48.930> gonna<00:02:49.080> hit<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> no<00:02:50.160> problem<00:02:50.760> yeah

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
side I'm gonna hit that no problem yeah

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.960 
side I'm gonna hit that no problem yeah
it's<00:02:51.240> good<00:02:51.420> feel<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.620> we'll<00:02:53.580> log<00:02:53.760> in

it's good feel to it and we'll log in
here<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.540> take<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> look<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:56.010> volume<00:02:56.550> up

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
here and take a look at the volume up

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.610 
here and take a look at the volume up
and<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.110> volume<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:59.370> okay<00:03:00.000> no<00:03:00.180> problem<00:03:00.690> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and the volume down okay no problem you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680 
and the volume down okay no problem you
you<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.670> awkward<00:03:02.820> because<00:03:03.120> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
you it's a little awkward because it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.680 
you it's a little awkward because it
does<00:03:03.900> kind<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.520> disappear<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.360> buttons

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
does kind of disappear the the buttons

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.420 
does kind of disappear the the buttons
in<00:03:06.810> terms<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.170> feel<00:03:07.380> there<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> little

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
in terms of feel there there is a little

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.820 
in terms of feel there there is a little
embossed<00:03:08.730> plus<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.840> minus<00:03:10.200> symbol<00:03:10.620> there

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
embossed plus and minus symbol there

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.010 
embossed plus and minus symbol there
which<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.400> see<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
which you can see so you do have a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.240 
which you can see so you do have a
little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.320> feel<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:13.830> feel<00:03:13.980> where

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
little bit feel and you can feel where

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.940 
little bit feel and you can feel where
the<00:03:14.280> plastic<00:03:14.850> texture<00:03:15.270> changes<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.830> a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the plastic texture changes but it's a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.410 
the plastic texture changes but it's a
little<00:03:17.190> awkward<00:03:17.310> not<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.790> have<00:03:17.940> those<00:03:18.150> raised

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
little awkward not to have those raised

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.840 
little awkward not to have those raised
buttons<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.960> then<00:03:19.260> again<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.850> silenced

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
buttons and then again the silenced

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.660 
buttons and then again the silenced
button<00:03:21.090> actually<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.660> can't<00:03:22.620> reach<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.310> my

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
button actually I can't reach it with my

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.480 
button actually I can't reach it with my
thumbnail<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.570> that's<00:03:25.500> pretty<00:03:26.280> interesting

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
thumbnail so that's pretty interesting

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.940 
thumbnail so that's pretty interesting
because<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:27.630> thick<00:03:27.990> actually<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.800> if

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
because it's so thick actually I can if

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.770 
because it's so thick actually I can if
I<00:03:29.040> kind<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.340> angle<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.330> there<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.630> you're

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
I kind of angle it in there but you're

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.000 
I kind of angle it in there but you're
gonna<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.140> almost<00:03:31.290> use<00:03:31.530> your<00:03:31.710> index

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
gonna have to almost use your index

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.150 
gonna have to almost use your index
fingers<00:03:32.630> fingernail<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.810> get<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.350> one

you<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.950> rubber<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.460> up<00:03:50.580> here

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
you just have the rubber and up here

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.700 
you just have the rubber and up here
there's<00:03:51.000> since<00:03:51.270> there's<00:03:51.450> no<00:03:51.630> cutouts<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.380> I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
there's since there's no cutouts and I

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.110 
there's since there's no cutouts and I
don't<00:03:52.860> know<00:03:52.920> even<00:03:53.070> button<00:03:53.400> anymore<00:03:53.700> except

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
don't know even button anymore except

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.670 
don't know even button anymore except
for<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.300> cutout<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.110> know<00:03:55.230> it's<00:03:55.380> pretty

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
for this cutout you know it's pretty

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.490 
for this cutout you know it's pretty
it's<00:03:55.860> on<00:03:55.980> there<00:03:56.130> pretty<00:03:56.340> sturdy<00:03:57.260> but<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.410> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it's on there pretty sturdy but at the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.960 
it's on there pretty sturdy but at the
bottom<00:03:58.620> where<00:03:58.950> there<00:03:59.100> are<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> lot<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.610> cutouts

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
bottom where there are a lot of cutouts

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.820 
bottom where there are a lot of cutouts
and<00:04:00.210> you<00:04:00.300> lose<00:04:00.540> material<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:01.230> always<00:04:01.590> kind<00:04:01.770> of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and you lose material I always kind of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.110 
and you lose material I always kind of
wonder<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.220> can<00:04:02.400> see<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.640> peel<00:04:02.850> pulls

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
wonder and you can see it peel pulls

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720 
wonder and you can see it peel pulls
away<00:04:03.300> at<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.840> little<00:04:04.110> bit<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.860> turn<00:04:05.640> this

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
away at just a little bit we turn this

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.230 
away at just a little bit we turn this
around

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
around

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.970 
around
um<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:07.140> know<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:07.440> at<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> bottom<00:04:07.830> it's

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
um you know here at the bottom it's

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.910 
um you know here at the bottom it's
pretty<00:04:08.190> easy<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.610> kind<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.470> flex<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.709> piece

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
pretty easy to kind of flex this piece

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.920 
pretty easy to kind of flex this piece
you<00:04:10.950> know<00:04:11.220> it's<00:04:11.370> not<00:04:11.520> bad<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.570> cutouts

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
you know it's not bad and the cutouts

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.590 
you know it's not bad and the cutouts
are<00:04:13.080> pretty<00:04:13.320> large<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.890> if<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.070> have<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:15.120> beats

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
are pretty large so if you have a beats

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.390 
are pretty large so if you have a beats
headphone<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.109> assume<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.220> won't

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
headphone I assume that you you won't

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.490 
headphone I assume that you you won't
have<00:04:17.520> much<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.940> problem<00:04:20.510> accessing<00:04:21.510> that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
have much of a problem accessing that

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.650 
have much of a problem accessing that
the<00:04:22.860> microphone<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.790> Lightning<00:04:24.120> port<00:04:24.330> so

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
the microphone and the Lightning port so

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.840 
the microphone and the Lightning port so
that's<00:04:25.470> all<00:04:25.650> pretty<00:04:26.040> well<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.370> good

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that's all pretty well and good

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.840 
that's all pretty well and good
then<00:04:27.000> actually<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.600> front<00:04:27.780> part<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.440> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
then actually on the front part of the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.030 
then actually on the front part of the
TPU<00:04:29.850> rubber<00:04:30.240> it's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.230> little<00:04:31.470> glossy<00:04:31.740> I'm

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
TPU rubber it's a little glossy I'm

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.400 
TPU rubber it's a little glossy I'm
actually<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.760> it's<00:04:33.450> it's<00:04:34.020> actually<00:04:34.200> a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
actually it's it's it's actually a

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.610 
actually it's it's it's actually a
little<00:04:34.680> bit<00:04:34.830> like<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.570> harder<00:04:36.570> plastic<00:04:36.870> inlay

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
little bit like a a harder plastic inlay

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.650 
little bit like a a harder plastic inlay
so<00:04:37.680> I'm<00:04:37.980> not<00:04:38.130> exactly<00:04:38.790> sure<00:04:39.000> how<00:04:39.270> they<00:04:39.420> did

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
so I'm not exactly sure how they did

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.090 
so I'm not exactly sure how they did
that<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.050> that's<00:04:40.560> gonna<00:04:40.680> as<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.950> get<00:04:41.070> a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
that but that's gonna as you get a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.700 
that but that's gonna as you get a
little<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.760> glossy<00:04:42.030> edge<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:43.170> think

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
little bit of a glossy edge and I think

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.580 
little bit of a glossy edge and I think
this<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.100> actually<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.840> over<00:04:46.560> time

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
this is actually more so that over time

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.940 
this is actually more so that over time
you<00:04:47.070> don't<00:04:47.190> free<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.780> rubber<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.440> softer

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
you don't free the rubber the softer

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.190 
you don't free the rubber the softer
rubber<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.420> pretty<00:04:51.630> cool<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:51.960> let's<00:04:52.110> go

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
rubber but it's pretty cool so let's go

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.620 
rubber but it's pretty cool so let's go
ahead<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.380> try<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.620> kickstand<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:54.060> use<00:04:54.420> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
ahead and try this kickstand if I use it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
ahead and try this kickstand if I use it
like<00:04:55.320> this

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
like this

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.740 
like this
and<00:04:55.950> now<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.340> won't<00:04:56.520> fall<00:04:56.790> out<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.450> doesn't

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
and now it won't fall out it doesn't

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.390 
and now it won't fall out it doesn't
have<00:04:57.840> any<00:04:57.990> resistance<00:04:58.500> once<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.920> out<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.340> you

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
have any resistance once it's out so you

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.370 
have any resistance once it's out so you
can<00:04:59.550> kind<00:04:59.730> of<00:04:59.790> put<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.120> wherever<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:00.930> but

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
can kind of put it wherever you want but

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.220 
can kind of put it wherever you want but
if<00:05:01.620> you<00:05:01.710> put<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.270> too<00:05:03.270> far<00:05:03.300> in<00:05:03.720> because<00:05:04.080> there's

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
if you put it too far in because there's

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.390 
if you put it too far in because there's
no<00:05:05.300> resistance<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.780> it's<00:05:06.930> gonna<00:05:07.250> just<00:05:08.250> kind

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
no resistance to it it's gonna just kind

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.010 
no resistance to it it's gonna just kind
of<00:05:08.430> collapse<00:05:08.760> in<00:05:08.940> on<00:05:09.000> itself<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.570> probably

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
of collapse in on itself so you probably

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.770 
of collapse in on itself so you probably
move<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.350> all<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.500> way<00:05:10.590> out<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.600> take<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.630> look

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
move it all the way out and take a look

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.970 
move it all the way out and take a look
at<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.260> angle<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.910> if<00:05:15.480> if<00:05:16.110> yeah<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.860> actually

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
at that angle so if if yeah and actually

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.860 
at that angle so if if yeah and actually
you<00:05:17.610> almost<00:05:17.790> want<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.120> fold<00:05:18.270> them<00:05:18.390> all<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.750> way

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
you almost want to fold them all the way

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.260 
you almost want to fold them all the way
back<00:05:19.310> might<00:05:20.310> be<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.460> little<00:05:20.700> hard<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.940> see<00:05:21.090> there

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
back might be a little hard to see there

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.200 
back might be a little hard to see there
but<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:22.230> that<00:05:22.260> it<00:05:22.590> can't<00:05:23.100> go<00:05:23.310> anywhere<00:05:23.490> except

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
but so that it can't go anywhere except

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.480 
but so that it can't go anywhere except
hold<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.810> phone<00:05:25.020> up<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.800> you're<00:05:26.040> looking<00:05:26.370> at

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
hold the phone up but you're looking at

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.040 
hold the phone up but you're looking at
a<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:28.410> know<00:05:28.530> maybe<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.800> twenty<00:05:29.280> five<00:05:29.580> angle<00:05:30.270> 25

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
a you know maybe a twenty five angle 25

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.140 
a you know maybe a twenty five angle 25
degree<00:05:31.380> angle<00:05:31.410> from<00:05:31.980> flat<00:05:32.400> if<00:05:32.700> you<00:05:32.820> do<00:05:32.940> it<00:05:33.030> this

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
degree angle from flat if you do it this

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.840 
degree angle from flat if you do it this
way<00:05:33.300> now<00:05:33.480> if<00:05:33.600> I<00:05:33.800> rotate<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.830> like<00:05:35.010> this<00:05:35.070> that's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
way now if I rotate it like this that's

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.670 
way now if I rotate it like this that's
actually<00:05:36.210> not<00:05:36.330> bad<00:05:36.390> that's<00:05:36.810> probably<00:05:37.260> where

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
actually not bad that's probably where

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.380 
actually not bad that's probably where
you'd<00:05:37.920> want<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.250> put<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:38.550> on<00:05:38.640> like<00:05:38.880> an<00:05:39.030> airplane

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
you'd want to put it on like an airplane

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.420 
you'd want to put it on like an airplane
tray<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.780> watch<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.170> movie<00:05:40.320> or<00:05:40.500> on<00:05:40.800> your<00:05:40.950> desk<00:05:41.190> to

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
tray to watch a movie or on your desk to

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.550 
tray to watch a movie or on your desk to
watch<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.700> podcast<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.540> can<00:05:43.140> see<00:05:43.290> they're

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
watch a podcast and you can see they're

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.070 
watch a podcast and you can see they're
on<00:05:43.980> a<00:05:44.610> flat<00:05:44.970> angle<00:05:45.180> it's<00:05:45.510> you're<00:05:45.780> probably

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
on a flat angle it's you're probably

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.800 
on a flat angle it's you're probably
looking<00:05:46.740> at<00:05:46.890> something<00:05:47.100> like<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:48.090> don't<00:05:48.600> know<00:05:48.780> a

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
looking at something like I don't know a

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.410 
looking at something like I don't know a
70<00:05:49.350> degree<00:05:49.470> angle<00:05:50.310> or<00:05:50.370> 65<00:05:50.880> degree<00:05:51.180> angle<00:05:51.210> so

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
70 degree angle or 65 degree angle so

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.570 
70 degree angle or 65 degree angle so
you<00:05:51.570> get<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.750> pretty<00:05:52.350> nice<00:05:52.560> upright<00:05:52.950> so<00:05:53.130> either

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
you get a pretty nice upright so either

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.430 
you get a pretty nice upright so either
way<00:05:53.820> you've<00:05:53.970> got<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.390> couple<00:05:54.780> of<00:05:54.990> different

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
way you've got a couple of different

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.840 
way you've got a couple of different
options<00:05:55.560> there<00:05:56.070> depending<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.670> how<00:05:56.790> you

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
options there depending on how you

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.300 
options there depending on how you
oriented<00:05:57.540> so<00:05:57.750> kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.500> cool<00:05:58.710> one<00:05:59.130> of<00:05:59.220> the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
oriented so kind of cool one of the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.890 
oriented so kind of cool one of the
things<00:05:59.490> that<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.880> reason<00:06:00.120> I<00:06:00.180> got<00:06:00.330> this<00:06:00.540> is<00:06:00.600> I

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
things that the reason I got this is I

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.960 
things that the reason I got this is I
was<00:06:01.380> actually<00:06:01.560> driving<00:06:01.890> a<00:06:02.190> car<00:06:02.400> that<00:06:02.610> wasn't

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
was actually driving a car that wasn't

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.480 
was actually driving a car that wasn't
mine<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.720> they<00:06:04.050> had<00:06:04.200> one<00:06:04.380> of<00:06:04.530> those<00:06:04.680> flat

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
mine and they had one of those flat

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.430 
mine and they had one of those flat
cubby<00:06:06.060> trays<00:06:06.420> at<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.840> top<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.260> dashboard

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
cubby trays at the top of the dashboard

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.770 
cubby trays at the top of the dashboard
and<00:06:07.980> I<00:06:08.100> was<00:06:08.220> using<00:06:08.370> my<00:06:08.550> phone<00:06:08.760> as<00:06:08.970> a<00:06:09.000> GPS<00:06:09.540> and

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
and I was using my phone as a GPS and

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.930 
and I was using my phone as a GPS and
there<00:06:10.140> was<00:06:10.230> no<00:06:10.410> way<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.620> put<00:06:10.980> it<00:06:11.100> except<00:06:11.430> flat

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
there was no way to put it except flat

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.270 
there was no way to put it except flat
in<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.810> tray<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.380> couldn't<00:06:13.680> see<00:06:14.070> the

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
in the tray and so I couldn't see the

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.580 
in the tray and so I couldn't see the
directions<00:06:14.610> or<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.510> visualization<00:06:16.500> on

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
directions or the the visualization on

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.970 
directions or the the visualization on
the<00:06:16.650> map

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
the map

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.200 
the map
but<00:06:17.130> I<00:06:17.190> could<00:06:17.340> hear<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.640> directions<00:06:18.030> but<00:06:18.150> I

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
but I could hear the directions but I

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.210 
but I could hear the directions but I
thought<00:06:18.480> geez<00:06:19.080> if<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.440> had<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.650> kickstand<00:06:20.130> I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
thought geez if I had a kickstand I

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.710 
thought geez if I had a kickstand I
could<00:06:20.370> have<00:06:20.460> just<00:06:20.610> put<00:06:20.790> it<00:06:20.880> like<00:06:21.030> that<00:06:21.180> in<00:06:21.660> that

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
could have just put it like that in that

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.660 
could have just put it like that in that
tray<00:06:22.200> because<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.500> was<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.620> rubberized<00:06:23.160> mat<00:06:23.460> and

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
tray because it was a rubberized mat and

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.140 
tray because it was a rubberized mat and
use<00:06:24.270> my<00:06:24.510> own<00:06:24.690> phone<00:06:25.020> for<00:06:25.350> a<00:06:25.380> GPS<00:06:25.800> in<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.100> car<00:06:26.310> I

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
use my own phone for a GPS in the car I

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.270 
use my own phone for a GPS in the car I
wish<00:06:27.570> I<00:06:27.690> had<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:27.960> at<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.170> time<00:06:28.350> but<00:06:28.650> now<00:06:29.160> I've
