00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
answer together but I was doing some

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.780

diatomaceous earth was sort of a killer

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.050 
diatomaceous earth was sort of a killer
for<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.069> lot<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:34.250> stuff<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.489> lived<00:03:35.760> here

big round on the ground at night humid

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
big round on the ground at night humid
to<00:03:43.380> detritus<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.130> they<00:03:44.580> need<00:03:45.830> diatomaceous

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
earth it's as effective against them as

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.660 
earth it's as effective against them as
it<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.310> against<00:03:50.790> caterpillars<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.750> broccoli

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
it is against caterpillars and broccoli

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.050 
it is against caterpillars and broccoli
so<00:03:54.620> I'm<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.980> glad<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.670> made<00:03:56.849> that

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
so I'm just glad that I made that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.110 
so I'm just glad that I made that
mistake<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.900> small<00:03:58.260> area

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.640 

that<00:04:02.659> I<00:04:03.280> didn't<00:04:04.280> lose<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.760> earth<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.650> what

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
that I didn't lose the earth and what

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.140 
that I didn't lose the earth and what
I'm<00:04:06.769> going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:06.980> do<00:04:07.159> now<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.730> just<00:04:07.760> try<00:04:08.330> to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
I'm going to do now is just try to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.430 
I'm going to do now is just try to
stabilize<00:04:11.150> what's<00:04:11.900> here

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
stabilize what's here

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.180 
stabilize what's here
I<00:04:12.519> mean<00:04:13.519> diatomaceous<00:04:13.970> earth<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.980> found<00:04:15.980> all

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
I mean diatomaceous earth is found all

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.800 
I mean diatomaceous earth is found all
over<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.579> planet<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:18.470> natural<00:04:18.979> processes

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
and control it after a while to wash it

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.540 
and control it after a while to wash it
away<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.510> do<00:04:23.750> whatever<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.290> does<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:25.340> this

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
stuff they weren't doing it and then

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.990 
stuff they weren't doing it and then
after<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.530> did<00:04:39.650> these<00:04:40.130> things<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.760> thought

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
after I did these things that I thought

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.490 
after I did these things that I thought
were<00:04:41.270> very<00:04:41.470> natural<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.740> they<00:04:43.010> would<00:04:44.500> be

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
were very natural and they would be

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.320 
were very natural and they would be
Friends<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.130> Earth<00:04:46.340> they<00:04:46.610> turned<00:04:46.910> out<00:04:47.060> not

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
Friends of the Earth they turned out not

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.860 
Friends of the Earth they turned out not
to<00:04:47.600> be<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.620> then<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.220> try<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.610> fix<00:04:50.570> this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
to be and then to try to fix this

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.180 
to be and then to try to fix this
problem<00:04:52.600> would<00:04:53.600> probably<00:04:54.110> even<00:04:54.590> be<00:04:54.919> more

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
problem would probably even be more

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.549 
problem would probably even be more
irresponsible<00:04:56.260> so

00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:58.559 
irresponsible so

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.939 
irresponsible so
it<00:04:59.559> is<00:04:59.769> what<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.159> is<00:05:00.369> I<00:05:00.689> do<00:05:01.689> know<00:05:02.079> what<00:05:02.589> you<00:05:02.769> were

here with the cabbage and the fact that

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.139 
here with the cabbage and the fact that

made<00:05:16.449> up<00:05:16.629> all<00:05:16.839> the<00:05:17.019> cores

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.379 

this<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:22.020> going<00:05:22.230> to<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.560> little<00:05:22.920> orchard
