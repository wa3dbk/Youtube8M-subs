00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
with the world's newest minority what

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
with the world's newest minority what
that<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.770> their<00:01:44.040> struggles<00:01:44.600> their

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that was like their struggles their

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
that was like their struggles their
family<00:01:46.049> struggles<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.189> family

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
family struggles their family

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.179 
family struggles their family
relationship<00:01:48.030> relationship<00:01:48.750> between<00:01:49.680> two

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
relationship relationship between two

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.800 
relationship relationship between two
opposites<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
opposites I think and I think the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
opposites I think and I think the
writing<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.850> probably<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> best

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
writing was was probably the best

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
writing was was probably the best
writing<00:01:57.420> I've<00:01:57.630> ever<00:01:57.840> been<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> involved<00:01:59.310> with

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
writing I've ever been and involved with

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
writing I've ever been and involved with
so<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.320> fans<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.189> think

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so I think that fans got it and I think

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.300 
so I think that fans got it and I think
that<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.700> look<00:02:02.880> forward<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:04.219> seeing<00:02:05.219> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that they look forward to seeing that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.819 
that they look forward to seeing that
every<00:02:05.670> week<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:07.259> touched<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.710> lot

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
every week and they and it touched a lot

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.529 
every week and they and it touched a lot
of<00:02:07.890> people<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.030> honest<00:02:09.330> answer

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
of people and that's the honest answer

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:18.440 
of people and that's the honest answer
but<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.140> yours<00:02:10.619> was<00:02:10.770> good<00:02:10.979> too

world<00:02:35.909> and<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.720> characters<00:02:37.319> was<00:02:37.920> sort<00:02:38.159> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
world and the characters was sort of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.039 
world and the characters was sort of
difficult<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.760> come<00:02:38.909> back<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.359> but<00:02:39.569> we<00:02:39.720> sort<00:02:39.959> of

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
difficult to come back to but we sort of

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.319 
difficult to come back to but we sort of
what<00:02:40.349> sort<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.620> hit<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.829> ground<00:02:41.040> running<00:02:41.430> but

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
what sort of hit the ground running but

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.880 
what sort of hit the ground running but
work-wise<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.439> series<00:02:43.799> was<00:02:44.010> quite<00:02:44.370> grueling

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
work-wise the series was quite grueling

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.949 
work-wise the series was quite grueling
doing<00:02:46.890> back-to-back<00:02:47.459> episode<00:02:47.970> long<00:02:48.690> about

that I say almost every show or film

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.080 
that I say almost every show or film
what<00:07:24.290> we<00:07:24.410> had<00:07:24.650> was<00:07:24.920> the<00:07:25.190> opportunity<00:07:25.880> to

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
what we had was the opportunity to

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.390 
what we had was the opportunity to
invent<00:07:27.020> so<00:07:27.320> many<00:07:27.530> things<00:07:27.860> so<00:07:27.980> there<00:07:28.310> was

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
invent so many things so there was

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.460 
invent so many things so there was
always<00:07:28.610> this<00:07:28.850> great<00:07:29.150> sense<00:07:29.510> of<00:07:29.750> play<00:07:30.140> and

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
always this great sense of play and

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.070 
always this great sense of play and
invention<00:07:31.010> in<00:07:31.220> every<00:07:31.640> episode<00:07:32.180> in<00:07:32.720> movie<00:07:32.990> and

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
invention in every episode in movie and

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.350 
invention in every episode in movie and
that's<00:07:33.140> that<00:07:33.800> was<00:07:33.920> the<00:07:34.040> freedom<00:07:34.280> and<00:07:34.790> the<00:07:35.120> gift

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.290 
that's that was the freedom and the gift
now<00:07:36.080> I<00:07:36.110> mean<00:07:36.290> as<00:07:36.410> actors<00:07:36.590> that<00:07:37.370> we<00:07:37.520> had<00:07:37.730> I<00:07:38.000> think

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
now I mean as actors that we had I think

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.170
