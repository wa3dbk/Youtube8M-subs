00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this says final review day one and it's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420 
this says final review day one and it's
all<00:00:19.140> trig<00:00:19.410> stuff<00:00:19.710> we're<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
all trig stuff we're really going to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.160 
all trig stuff we're really going to
start<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> last<00:00:21.270> page<00:00:21.630> mr.<00:00:21.990> chinnough

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
start on the last page mr. chinnough

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.040 
start on the last page mr. chinnough
says<00:00:22.500> final<00:00:23.010> review<00:00:23.310> day<00:00:23.460> 4<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
says final review day 4 but this is the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
says final review day 4 but this is the
oldest<00:00:25.529> stuff<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.189> feel<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.640> need<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
oldest stuff so I feel like we need to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.720 
oldest stuff so I feel like we need to
refresh<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> remember

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
refresh this first so if you remember

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
refresh this first so if you remember
way<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.529> in<00:00:32.210> August<00:00:33.210> when<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.079> met<00:00:34.350> our

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
way back in August when we first met our

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
way back in August when we first met our
first<00:00:35.340> topics<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.120> talked<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.540> we're

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first topics that we talked about we're

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
first topics that we talked about we're
domain<00:00:38.149> and<00:00:39.710> range<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> remember<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> made<00:00:45.180> all

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
domain and range so remember we made all

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
domain and range so remember we made all
the<00:00:45.420> posters<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.469> found<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> our

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the posters and we found all of our

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
the posters and we found all of our
great<00:00:47.370> functions<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.239> did<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.660> work

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
great functions and we did all this work

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
great functions and we did all this work
and<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.190> domain<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.600> all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and so really what domain is is just all

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.670 
and so really what domain is is just all
of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> X<00:00:52.620> values<00:00:58.160> values<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.210> function<00:01:02.149> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
of the X values values of a function and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.899 
of the X values values of a function and
then<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.100> easy<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> remember<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
then that was easy to remember that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
then that was easy to remember that
range<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> give<00:01:08.159> us<00:01:08.310> all

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
range then was just going to give us all

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.780 
range then was just going to give us all
of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.880> Y<00:01:09.030> values<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.400> those<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.610> things

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of the Y values and those are things

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.190 
of the Y values and those are things
boards<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> had<00:01:18.540> already<00:01:18.689> heard<00:01:18.990> before

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
boards that you had already heard before

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
boards that you had already heard before
and<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> wasn't<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.400> complicated

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and so it wasn't really that complicated

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
and so it wasn't really that complicated
for<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
for you but there are things that we

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
for you but there are things that we
learned<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.150> restricted<00:01:24.869> for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
learned about that was restricted for

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.370 
learned about that was restricted for
domain<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.330> important<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.110> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
domain so really important things that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.370 
domain so really important things that
we<00:01:28.619> talked<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.040> were<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.720> denominator

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
we talked about were the denominator

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
we talked about were the denominator
cannot<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.860> equal<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> 0<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:38.659> remember<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.840> we

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
cannot be equal to 0 I remember when we

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.069 
cannot be equal to 0 I remember when we
graph<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:41.009> rational<00:01:41.460> functions

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
graph these doing rational functions

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
graph these doing rational functions
anytime<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> denominator<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.979> equal<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> 0

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
anytime the denominator is equal to 0

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.710 
anytime the denominator is equal to 0
this<00:01:44.909> creates<00:01:45.329> vertical<00:01:45.960> asymptotes

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.590 

we'll<00:01:53.720> review<00:01:54.320> graphing<00:01:54.860> tomorrow<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:55.670> relax

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
we'll review graphing tomorrow so relax

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600 
we'll review graphing tomorrow so relax
about<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:57.920> another<00:01:58.070> thing<00:01:58.550> that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
about that and then another thing that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.830 
about that and then another thing that
was<00:01:58.820> really<00:01:58.880> important<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.510> we<00:01:59.600> talked

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
was really important that we talked

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.950 
was really important that we talked
about<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.170> square<00:02:00.470> roots<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:04.930> remember<00:02:05.930> that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
about is square roots so remember that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.980 
about is square roots so remember that
symbol<00:02:06.560> now<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.520> guys<00:02:07.850> know<00:02:08.180> that<00:02:08.210> everything

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
symbol now you guys know that everything

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.350 
symbol now you guys know that everything
inside<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.560> whatever's<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.790> on<00:02:10.910> with

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
inside here whatever's going on with

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.870 
inside here whatever's going on with
this<00:02:11.570> function<00:02:12.110> inside<00:02:12.890> there<00:02:13.190> remember<00:02:13.790> it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
this function inside there remember it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.440 
this function inside there remember it
always<00:02:14.090> has<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.510> be<00:02:15.340> something<00:02:16.340> greater<00:02:17.210> than

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
always has to be something greater than

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.900 
always has to be something greater than
or<00:02:17.840> equal<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.380> zero<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.280> know<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
or equal to zero because you know that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.190 
or equal to zero because you know that
you<00:02:20.030> can't<00:02:20.270> take<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> square<00:02:20.780> root<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
you can't take the square root of a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.880 
you can't take the square root of a
negative<00:02:21.320> number<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.150> keep<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.360> mind<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
negative number so keep that in mind and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.620 
negative number so keep that in mind and
then<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.670> last<00:02:25.820> thing<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.270> talked<00:02:26.510> about

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
then the last thing that we talked about

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.820 
then the last thing that we talked about
our<00:02:26.780> logs<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:28.900> logs<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.200> haven't<00:02:30.590> done<00:02:30.770> much

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
our logs and logs we haven't done much

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.860 
our logs and logs we haven't done much
with<00:02:31.520> until<00:02:31.880> next<00:02:32.030> semester<00:02:32.240> but<00:02:32.660> they<00:02:32.810> do

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
with until next semester but they do

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.500 
with until next semester but they do
affect<00:02:33.320> domain<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.940> needs<00:02:35.150> time<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.480> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
affect domain so it needs time to do a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.470 
affect domain so it needs time to do a
log<00:02:35.780> or<00:02:36.140> any<00:02:36.440> time<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.800> natural<00:02:37.070> log

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
log or any time you do a natural log

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.870 
log or any time you do a natural log
whatever's<00:02:38.480> inside<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.870> here<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.560> function

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
whatever's inside of here this function

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
whatever's inside of here this function
will<00:02:40.880> call<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.150> G<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.570> X<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.920> by<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.490> very

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
will call that G of X now that by a very

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.870 
will call that G of X now that by a very
good<00:02:44.030> G<00:02:44.300> okay<00:02:44.810> start<00:02:45.290> over<00:02:45.410> G<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.160> X<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.820> has

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
good G okay start over G of X that has

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.620 
good G okay start over G of X that has
to<00:02:47.270> be<00:02:47.470> greater<00:02:48.470> than<00:02:48.830> zero

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
to be greater than zero

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.390 
to be greater than zero
so<00:02:50.630> when<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:50.930> first<00:02:51.140> started<00:02:51.290> out<00:02:51.740> we<00:02:51.980> had<00:02:52.010> some

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
so when we first started out we had some

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.229 
so when we first started out we had some
problems<00:02:52.940> just<00:02:53.810> find<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.290> domain<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.770> range

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
problems just find the domain and range

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.070 
problems just find the domain and range
so<00:02:56.239> if<00:02:56.420> we<00:02:56.600> said<00:02:56.840> something<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.760> f<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:59.120> X<00:02:59.300> was

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
so if we said something like f of X was

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.020 
so if we said something like f of X was
equal<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.590> x<00:03:00.920> squared<00:03:01.340> plus<00:03:02.209> 5x<00:03:02.570> minus<00:03:03.230> 8<00:03:04.070> you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
equal to x squared plus 5x minus 8 you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.270 
equal to x squared plus 5x minus 8 you
would<00:03:05.150> think<00:03:05.390> okay<00:03:05.870> what<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.739> looking<00:03:07.070> for

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
would think okay what I'm looking for

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.979 
would think okay what I'm looking for
domain<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.970> only<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.450> check<00:03:08.630> for<00:03:08.840> these

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
domain I only have to check for these

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.949 
domain I only have to check for these
three<00:03:09.290> things<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> fraction<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.870> I

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
three things is there a fraction that I

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.790 
three things is there a fraction that I
need<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.350> concerned<00:03:12.560> about<00:03:13.810> no<00:03:14.810> check<00:03:15.769> that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
need to be concerned about no check that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.900 
need to be concerned about no check that
one<00:03:16.160> off<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.430> list

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
one off the list

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.430 
one off the list
are<00:03:17.269> there<00:03:17.540> any<00:03:17.660> square<00:03:17.989> roots<00:03:19.690> no<00:03:20.690> no<00:03:21.140> square

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
are there any square roots no no square

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.039 
are there any square roots no no square
roots<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.610> what<00:03:22.790> about<00:03:22.970> lobs<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.930> any

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
roots and what about lobs you see any

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.759 
roots and what about lobs you see any
logs<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.739> problem<00:03:25.810> nope<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.500> if<00:03:27.620> you

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
logs and this problem nope so if you

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.320 
logs and this problem nope so if you
don't<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.160> any<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.610> these<00:03:28.730> things<00:03:28.790> to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
don't have any of these things to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.630 
don't have any of these things to
restrict<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.900> domain<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.430> just

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
restrict the domain then you can just

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.680 
restrict the domain then you can just
say<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.090> domain<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.900> all<00:03:33.799> real<00:03:34.100> numbers

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.900 

and<00:03:38.690> remember<00:03:39.350> we<00:03:39.500> use<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.860> funny<00:03:40.160> capital<00:03:40.700> R

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
and remember we use that funny capital R

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.320 
and remember we use that funny capital R
with<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.360> double<00:03:41.690> bar<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.230> side<00:03:43.150> now<00:03:44.150> with

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
with the double bar on the side now with

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.759 
with the double bar on the side now with
the<00:03:44.480> range<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:45.049> was<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> little<00:03:45.500> bit<00:03:45.620> more

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
the range it was a little bit more

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.340 
the range it was a little bit more
complicated<00:03:46.190> for<00:03:46.580> these<00:03:46.880> things<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
complicated for these things so you

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.100 
complicated for these things so you
should<00:03:48.860> know<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.700> when<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.120> look<00:03:50.299> at<00:03:50.450> this

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
should know that when you look at this

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.230 
should know that when you look at this
the<00:03:51.320> graph<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.800> parabola<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:55.210> what<00:03:56.210> I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
the graph of the parabola so what I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.730 
the graph of the parabola so what I
would<00:03:56.420> expect<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.870> guys<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.110> do<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.410> get<00:03:57.620> out

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
would expect you guys to do is get out

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.280 
would expect you guys to do is get out
your<00:03:57.770> calculator<00:03:58.180> your<00:03:59.180> graphing<00:03:59.690> calculator

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
your calculator your graphing calculator

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.280 
your calculator your graphing calculator
and<00:04:00.770> when<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.310> graph<00:04:01.520> this<00:04:01.790> parabola<00:04:02.290> it's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
and when you graph this parabola it's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.520 
and when you graph this parabola it's
gonna<00:04:03.530> look<00:04:03.770> something<00:04:05.440> roughly<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.590> that

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
gonna look something roughly like that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.200 
gonna look something roughly like that
roughly<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.470> here<00:04:13.010> would<00:04:13.610> be<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.820> point<00:04:13.850> that

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
roughly so here would be the point that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.090 
roughly so here would be the point that
you<00:04:14.330> would<00:04:14.450> have<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.690> find<00:04:14.900> using<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.560> minimum

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
you would have to find using the minimum

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.190 
you would have to find using the minimum
button<00:04:16.730> on<00:04:16.850> your<00:04:16.970> calculator<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.540> then<00:04:20.959> you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
button on your calculator and then you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.060 
button on your calculator and then you
can<00:04:21.350> plug<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.680> into<00:04:21.859> your<00:04:21.950> calculator

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
can plug that into your calculator

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.940 
can plug that into your calculator
remember<00:04:22.970> find<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.690> center<00:04:24.020> here<00:04:24.320> find<00:04:24.800> what

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
remember find the center here find what

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.550 
remember find the center here find what
the<00:04:25.070> minimum<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:26.120> let's<00:04:26.570> say<00:04:26.810> I'm<00:04:27.380> making

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
the minimum is and let's say I'm making

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.080 
the minimum is and let's say I'm making
this<00:04:27.890> up<00:04:28.100> but<00:04:28.310> let's<00:04:28.520> say<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:28.910> is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
this up but let's say that this is

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.480 
this up but let's say that this is
negative<00:04:29.300> 3<00:04:29.780> negative<00:04:29.810> 10<00:04:30.470> your<00:04:30.890> calculator

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
negative 3 negative 10 your calculator

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.980 
negative 3 negative 10 your calculator
will<00:04:31.640> obviously<00:04:32.030> tell<00:04:32.420> you<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.750> correct

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
will obviously tell you the correct

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.550 
will obviously tell you the correct
number<00:04:33.410> then<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.370> would<00:04:34.490> say<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:35.030> range

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
number then you would say that the range

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.980 
number then you would say that the range
would<00:04:36.560> be<00:04:36.620> all<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.340> numbers<00:04:37.730> greater<00:04:38.180> than

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
would be all the numbers greater than

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.430 
would be all the numbers greater than
this<00:04:39.500> Y<00:04:39.740> value<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.640> Y<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.720> greater<00:04:42.050> than<00:04:42.170> or

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
this Y value so Y is greater than or

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.580 
this Y value so Y is greater than or
equal<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.830> negative<00:04:43.130> 10<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.590> that's

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
equal to negative 10 and that's

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.670 
equal to negative 10 and that's
basically<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.640> parabola<00:04:47.440> now<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:48.560> you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
basically it for a parabola now if you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.960 
basically it for a parabola now if you
have<00:04:48.800> something<00:04:49.100> that's<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.430> little<00:04:49.550> bit<00:04:49.820> more

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
have something that's a little bit more

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.700 
have something that's a little bit more
complicated<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:51.560> has<00:04:51.890> where<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:52.790> in<00:04:53.090> it

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
complicated that has where it's in it

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.570 
complicated that has where it's in it
let's<00:04:54.710> say<00:04:55.240> f<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.480> X<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:57.320> equal<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.250> square

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
let's say f of X is equal to the square

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.159 
let's say f of X is equal to the square
root<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:59.180> x<00:04:59.630> plus<00:05:00.169> step<00:05:01.180> well<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.360> let's

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
root of x plus step well I know let's

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.560 
root of x plus step well I know let's
see<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.350> have<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.620> square<00:05:04.040> root<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:04.850> everything

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
see I have a square root so everything

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.780 
see I have a square root so everything
inside<00:05:05.870> that<00:05:06.230> square<00:05:06.919> root<00:05:07.100> has<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.550> be

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
inside that square root has to be

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.200 
inside that square root has to be
greater<00:05:07.910> than<00:05:08.510> or<00:05:08.780> equal<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.200> 0<00:05:09.730> so<00:05:10.730> all<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:11.090> have

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
greater than or equal to 0 so all I have

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.940 
greater than or equal to 0 so all I have
to<00:05:11.360> do<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.600> take<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.110> other<00:05:12.290> thing<00:05:12.590> in<00:05:12.740> there

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
to do is take the other thing in there

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.380 
to do is take the other thing in there
and<00:05:13.400> say<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.960> has<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.350> be<00:05:15.760> greater<00:05:16.760> than<00:05:17.060> or

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
and say that has to be greater than or

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.750 
and say that has to be greater than or
equal<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.810> zero<00:05:18.140> which<00:05:18.980> then<00:05:19.220> gives<00:05:19.490> me<00:05:19.669> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
equal to zero which then gives me the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.440 
equal to zero which then gives me the
domain<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.570> X<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.080> greater<00:05:21.230> than<00:05:21.470> or<00:05:21.890> equal<00:05:22.070> to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
domain of X is greater than or equal to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.260 
domain of X is greater than or equal to
negative<00:05:23.450> seven<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.950> what<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.400> means<00:05:25.730> is<00:05:26.030> you

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
negative seven so what that means is you

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.780 
negative seven so what that means is you
can't<00:05:26.570> plug<00:05:26.990> any<00:05:27.290> values<00:05:27.860> in<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.669> are

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
can't plug any values in that are

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.000 
can't plug any values in that are
smaller<00:05:29.210> than<00:05:29.480> negative<00:05:29.690> seven<00:05:30.230> so<00:05:30.440> like<00:05:30.770> if<00:05:30.919> I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
smaller than negative seven so like if I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.250 
smaller than negative seven so like if I
plugged<00:05:31.280> in<00:05:31.430> negative<00:05:31.580> ten<00:05:32.060> I<00:05:32.540> would<00:05:33.020> get

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
plugged in negative ten I would get

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.110 
plugged in negative ten I would get
negative<00:05:33.440> three<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.490> can't<00:05:34.729> take<00:05:35.000> the

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
negative three and you can't take the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.960 
negative three and you can't take the
square<00:05:35.330> root<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.810> negative<00:05:35.930> number<00:05:36.970> and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
square root of a negative number and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.520 
square root of a negative number and
then<00:05:38.180> we<00:05:38.360> also<00:05:38.510> like<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.020> write<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.350> in

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
then we also like to write this in

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.950 
then we also like to write this in
interval<00:05:39.680> notation<00:05:40.510> we're<00:05:41.510> going<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.720> start

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
interval notation we're going to start

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
interval notation we're going to start
at<00:05:42.080> negative<00:05:42.110> seven<00:05:42.830> included<00:05:43.460> in<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:43.729> box

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
at negative seven included in the box

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.010 
at negative seven included in the box
and<00:05:44.300> then<00:05:44.450> go<00:05:44.630> 4

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
and then go 4

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.510 
and then go 4
ever<00:05:45.169> to<00:05:45.710> infinity<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:48.710> now<00:05:48.919> if<00:05:49.099> you<00:05:49.190> have<00:05:49.220> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
ever to infinity and now if you have the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.409 
ever to infinity and now if you have the
square<00:05:49.729> root<00:05:49.849> to<00:05:50.240> find<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.569> range<00:05:51.849> all<00:05:52.849> you

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
square root to find the range all you

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.080 
square root to find the range all you
have<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:53.720> do<00:05:53.840> is<00:05:53.960> just<00:05:54.139> plug<00:05:54.440> this<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.250> find

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
have to do is just plug this in so find

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.920 
have to do is just plug this in so find
the<00:05:56.210> f<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.629> negative<00:05:56.659> seven<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:59.180> then<00:05:59.810> you

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
the f of negative seven and then you

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.950 
the f of negative seven and then you
would<00:06:00.050> just<00:06:00.169> do<00:06:00.319> negative<00:06:00.560> seven<00:06:01.129> plus<00:06:01.400> seven

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
would just do negative seven plus seven

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.559 
would just do negative seven plus seven
that's<00:06:02.960> equal<00:06:03.319> to<00:06:03.349> the<00:06:03.680> square<00:06:03.800> root<00:06:04.009> of<00:06:04.129> zero

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
that's equal to the square root of zero

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.230 
that's equal to the square root of zero
which<00:06:05.569> you<00:06:05.720> guys<00:06:05.900> know<00:06:06.199> is<00:06:06.379> equal<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.770> zero<00:06:07.240> so

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
which you guys know is equal to zero so

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.469 
which you guys know is equal to zero so
square<00:06:08.900> root<00:06:09.310> graphs<00:06:10.310> basically<00:06:11.210> if<00:06:11.330> this

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
square root graphs basically if this

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.360 
square root graphs basically if this
one's<00:06:11.690> going<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:11.930> look<00:06:12.020> like<00:06:12.169> this<00:06:12.409> it's<00:06:13.250> going

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
one's going to look like this it's going

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.520 
one's going to look like this it's going
to<00:06:13.460> start<00:06:13.669> here<00:06:13.759> at<00:06:14.030> negative<00:06:14.389> seven<00:06:14.750> zero<00:06:15.020> and

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
to start here at negative seven zero and

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.779 
to start here at negative seven zero and
move<00:06:16.490> to<00:06:16.759> the<00:06:16.849> right<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.650> as<00:06:18.979> you<00:06:19.130> can<00:06:19.280> see<00:06:19.340> all

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
move to the right so as you can see all

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.460 
move to the right so as you can see all
the<00:06:20.060> X<00:06:20.240> values<00:06:20.389> are<00:06:20.870> bigger<00:06:21.080> than<00:06:21.289> negative

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
the X values are bigger than negative

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.890 
the X values are bigger than negative
seven<00:06:22.069> and<00:06:22.310> then<00:06:22.880> all<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.150> Y<00:06:23.300> values<00:06:23.750> are

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
seven and then all the Y values are

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.379 
seven and then all the Y values are
bigger<00:06:24.110> than<00:06:24.319> or<00:06:24.560> equal<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:25.009> zero<00:06:25.280> so<00:06:26.120> we<00:06:26.270> would

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
bigger than or equal to zero so we would

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.350 
bigger than or equal to zero so we would
say<00:06:26.569> that<00:06:26.750> the<00:06:26.900> range<00:06:27.139> is<00:06:27.729> y<00:06:28.729> is<00:06:28.789> greater<00:06:29.120> than

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
say that the range is y is greater than

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.680 
say that the range is y is greater than
or<00:06:29.599> equal<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.990> zero<00:06:30.319> or<00:06:31.190> an<00:06:31.580> interval<00:06:32.060> notation

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
or equal to zero or an interval notation

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.090 
or equal to zero or an interval notation
from<00:06:33.080> zero<00:06:33.409> to<00:06:34.090> infinity
