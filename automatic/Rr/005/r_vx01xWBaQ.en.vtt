00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
three take the time to break down a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.780 
three take the time to break down a
problem<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.930> fundamental<00:01:04.379> issue<00:01:04.790> whether

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
problem to one fundamental issue whether

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330 
problem to one fundamental issue whether
it's<00:01:06.060> breathing<00:01:06.689> whether<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.310> connecting<00:01:08.310> a

it's breathing whether it's connecting a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's breathing whether it's connecting a
shift<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> shift<00:01:09.840> between<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.350> notes<00:01:11.420> master

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
shift of shift between two notes master

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.700 
shift of shift between two notes master
that<00:01:12.810> skill<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:14.130> from<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.549> build

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
that skill and then from there build

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.570 
that skill and then from there build
number<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.570> practice<00:01:18.570> slowly<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.290> musically

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
number for practice slowly and musically

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
number for practice slowly and musically
allowing<00:01:21.180> yourself<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> hear<00:01:22.020> more<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.070> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
allowing yourself to hear more and to be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.940 
allowing yourself to hear more and to be
aware<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.610> several<00:01:24.060> things<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.720> once<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
aware of several things at once in a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670 
aware of several things at once in a
musical<00:01:26.400> context<00:01:27.230> gradually<00:01:28.230> then<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
musical context gradually then you can

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.820 
musical context gradually then you can
speed<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.160> temple<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.500> finally<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> most

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
speed up the temple and finally the most

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.990 
speed up the temple and finally the most

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
practice so the five things once again

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
practice so the five things once again
slow<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:47.630> practice<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.810> needs<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200

down<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.800> one<00:01:53.070> fundamental<00:01:53.490> issue<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.150> then

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
down to one fundamental issue and then

down to one fundamental issue and then
build<00:01:54.510> from<00:01:54.690> there<00:01:55.610> practice<00:01:56.610> slowly<00:01:57.390> and
