00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 open a secret this can be done and this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 will be more useful than any traditional 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:27.029
 the breakfast that we used to eat today 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.340
 Wore you to show 2 most recipes 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.929
 delicious breakfasts in the world you me 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 always ask salt show us 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.270
 some kind of helpful honest most 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.700
 the best recipes are those recipes that are not 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 recipe for example i love most 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 just take a huge plate of ripe 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
 mango any berries and a huge plate 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 great fruit or some kind of fruit 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 which season this tastes best to me 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 It seems tastier any recipes and this 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.949
 much better for digestion because 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.210
 Only one thing is necessary to digest them 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.910
 10 ingredients 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 but still I love to mess with my feet and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 arrange such beauty for breakfast and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 Today I wanted to share with you how 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.189
 make the same beauty and trust me 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.110
 it's very easy i think it all in 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.680
 principle can cook no matter where 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 you live the main thing that you need is a freezer 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 blender and bananas and you principle and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.619
 plate 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 and then you can make this recipe 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.060
 all you need to do is first 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 freeze ripe bananas they should be 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 ripe guys don't eat green bananas 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.890
 never it's terrible for digestion if 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.210
 it is possible in your city to buy and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 biological bananas or organic 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 they are a thousand times tastier and sweet 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.290
 and just much better because not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.570
 splashing chemistry on them wait until your 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.150
 bananas but soft and there will be spots 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 black more spots in than better and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.820
 sweeter they will be sweat when they 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.250
 will be ripe 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.619
 remove the skin and then put the bananas in 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.869
 the freezer I usually get around 7 or 8 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.060
 pieces in the freezer if this is your first time 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.799
 eating these things for breakfast I do not recommend 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 you only use one banana 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 there you sit and then after 1 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.260
 an hour you will be hungry 5 of course who would 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 not hungry 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.690
 one banana to eat 3 4 5 6 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.790
 it doesn't matter I promise you that you don't 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.070
 regret it 2 you have to fruit it is insane 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.920
 useful and afraid and just does not have 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.020
 meaning and not worth doing already afraid 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.620
 other things like alcohol and drugs they 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.110
 plans and what do i do chuv blender course 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.240
 same if you want you can just 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 make banana ice cream banana 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.140
 sorbet is insanely tasty but if you 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 want to make a fruit sorbet add 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.370
 any frozen fruit i buy 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 just understand frozen fruit no 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.310
 it's not bad guys it's just 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.290
 frozen fruit on the highway 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.030
 frozen strawberries will be added there 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.070
 ice cream on us would also be very 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.810
 tasty and mapped out house a lot 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.910
 these yaga add to taste 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.310
 berry they are just bananas with a little bit 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.920
 berries add more berries than 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.570
 bananas and this all followed you can 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.170
 add any of your favorite fruits 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.270
 top any ripe berries and a little bit 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.430
 coconut I do not advise you a lot of fat 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.680
 add because I don't know digestion 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.720
 become worse soon there will be a fig season so 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.310
 You never add his perfume I am very 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.020
 love milk is yes add 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.810
 exotic fruits can be bought in 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.820
 Russia in big cities for example the alphabet 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.830
 taste is probably the way the store is called I 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.510
 I know inexpensive to indulge all 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.730
 I think you can also add any 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.220
 dried fruits you want for example 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 the chemists and also very, very tasty if 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.690
 do you want to cut small pieces or 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.190
 even you can put a blender if you 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.170
 feel you want something a little bit 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.360
 send more energy you get 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.850
 very active add a little dates 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.590
 your blender and I did it like this 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.989
 my sorbet if someone will ask 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.330
 where did I buy this little plate 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.060
 she bought not just typed on google and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.980
 apple green bull and ordered from someone 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.110
 in my flora somewhere in tropical 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.880
 woods such things sell and second recipe 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.890
 who wanted to share this with you 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.330
 banana flakes because i'm 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.700
 I know that many sit cereal for breakfast 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.110
 but guys can and do much 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.570
 tastier and healthier 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.989
 all i did is add 4 super 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.580
 ate bananas not frozen but just 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.620
 normal banana in a blender and a little bit 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.940
 some water I added a lot of water to me 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.250
 to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.230
 because of this kulu is more like a banana 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.210
 water and tips there you want to do 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.670
 more like distemper and then add less 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.380
 here but still add the water and also 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.570
 you can sprinkle a little cinnamon and there 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.200
 after that i just bowl it all 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.600
 add 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.280
 and then throwing any dry fruit and 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.560
 which I want for example I added 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.780
 mordovets is a fruit that grows in 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.000
 Australia has all sorts of such tragic 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.800
 interesting places here I ordered them on 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.110
 their website so any such 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.020
 exotic dry fruits can be all 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.670
 order them and I know that they have them all 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.470
 sold in stores but on the internet 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.660
 I will also save us all organic 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.700
 cranberries added here would not be very 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.680
 delicious, too, add dried dates 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.710
 she just cut like that and they 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.960
 caramel just Hamitov I smell you 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.940
 I will find links to all sorts of such dried 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 fruit or cocoa can be wholesome 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.970
 order on their enemies i don't use 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.570
 cocoa because I do not like very much 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.550
 chocolate 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.040
 I cut that many have such addition 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.050
 so if you eat cocoa every day 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.570
 It seems to me that you should not rush to 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.190
 salads for breakfast right away 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.080

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.430

 no dry fruit you can some 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.750
 muesli or some flakes to add there 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800
 you can also find any thoughts in the shop I 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.960
