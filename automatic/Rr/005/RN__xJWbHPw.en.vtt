00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 first time surfing the classic form i 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.250
 try 1008 year it was in bali i 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.670
 I went there alone without knowing the language 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 knowledge of the country and I had a goal to conquer 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 exactly waves 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.920
 learn surfing I came to Russian 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 stewart school said teach me 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.560
 taught quite quickly so I started 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 progress began to travel 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.110
 began to look for new places recession and became 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 to understand the waves trying to conquer 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.300
 the biggest wave and rocks and here 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 but it is yet to come and that's well, Sri Lanka 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.710
 morocco portugal here are some of the most 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 such places where better waves 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:00.239
 Flow board is good because if you have 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 such an installation florida in the city yes then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.299
 it will give it turns out available that is not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.670
 need to go somewhere far abroad yes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.939
 where there are waves do not need to calculate 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 the seasonality of the waves like the Dominicans in the summer there 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.009
 do nothing good in winter 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.049
 waves or there a small budget can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.740
 just get the car either on the train 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.200
 either by bus get to flow ride and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.590
 flora ride is good because 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 hone technique turnaround technique 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 rack technology pumping balance and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.050
 all this in fact is not present in a safe environment 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.120
 there are no reefs 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.520
 evil locales that you will 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.090
 interfere i need to speak to someone wave 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.950
 for there you came and ride 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.020
 surfing in any form I came 2003 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.610
 year 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.070
 transvaal park to the infamous 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.300
 water parks 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.230
 i went there with classmates 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.410
 ride the roller coaster like all teenagers 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.490
 Children here and saw installation flavorayt 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.460
 bare all and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.550
 I have never seen anything like this afterwards 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.640
 instructors skated doing cool 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.980
 tricks here i'm instead of standing with 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 friends in line at 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.200
 aqua slides I stood in line for 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.530
 setting to ride the surf 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.440
 first time I spit out of there like not 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 I know how the bullet from the barrel and me it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.750
 I liked it in the end I stood in line 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.720
 namely to ride the surf 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.180
 all day long from the short bar gave it proudly and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.090
 bodibar yes I prefer languard so 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.209
 I think it 's closer to the sources. 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.430
 to the base of the surf doug polynesia and 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.570
 these are the very first boards that ever 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.030
 were essentially i love classics love 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.430
 run on the board love to move 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.550
 spinning therefore not worn he proud short 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.400
 the board I know how to ride a short board but 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.060
 I do not like because it is very large 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.550
 similarity with a snowboard and he has already become boring 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.520
 body board yes cool thing but still 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.610
 how to ride cost no more 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.680
 more interesting skills snowboarding skate and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.810
 other types of extreme sports 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.760
 they help me a lot 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.060
 as in any case is pumped 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.650
 balance 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.709
 equilibrium respond quickly to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.450
 situation snowboard escape 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.550
 it is a similar stand similar items 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.310
 turns in some cases even 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.930
 some tricks are the same here therefore 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.040
 snowboarding skater and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.400
 in general any kind of sport and 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.400
 only plus
