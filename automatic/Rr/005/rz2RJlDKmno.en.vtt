00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179 
are correct I told you that did that
would<00:01:41.880> fix<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> yeah<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.320> could<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.040> how

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
would fix it yeah you could you know how

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
would fix it yeah you could you know how
to<00:01:44.250> spark<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.119> fire<00:01:45.390> within<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.930> know<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to spark that fire within I know how to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.960 
to spark that fire within I know how to
solve<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.710> degenerate<00:01:47.130> gambler<00:01:47.159> revival

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
solve a degenerate gambler revival

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
solve a degenerate gambler revival
saying<00:01:48.270> hey<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.570> works<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.140> when

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
saying hey this works pretty well when

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100 
saying hey this works pretty well when
he<00:01:49.649> undid<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.950> against<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.720> for

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
he undid it against me I'm gonna try for

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
he undid it against me I'm gonna try for
the<00:01:52.229> early<00:01:52.530> pool<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.430> eight

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the early pool I think that was an eight

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
the early pool I think that was an eight
pool<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.000> could<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.240> mistaken<00:01:54.799> perhaps<00:01:55.799> we

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pool but I could be mistaken perhaps we

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
pool but I could be mistaken perhaps we
should<00:01:56.100> give<00:01:56.280> 1<00:01:56.460> 800<00:01:56.880> gambler<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> revival<00:01:57.899> as

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
should give 1 800 gambler to revival as

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.889 
should give 1 800 gambler to revival as
well<00:01:58.820> playing<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> deja<00:02:00.090> vu<00:02:00.270> game<00:02:00.450> over<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
well playing a deja vu game over of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.990 
well playing a deja vu game over of
course<00:02:01.079> revival<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> I've<00:02:02.130> loser<00:02:02.369> expanding

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000

on the south side of Poe tonight and you

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.230 
on the south side of Poe tonight and you
know<00:02:06.630> early<00:02:06.899> pool<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.680> player<00:02:07.890> maps

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
know early pool on to player maps

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.340 
know early pool on to player maps
is<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:10.320> extra<00:02:11.040> big<00:02:11.190> gamble<00:02:11.550> because<00:02:12.170> most<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
is an extra big gamble because most of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
is an extra big gamble because most of
the<00:02:13.470> time<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.130> players<00:02:14.250> doing<00:02:14.580> things

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the time you see players doing things

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120 
the time you see players doing things
like<00:02:15.000> 15<00:02:15.510> pool<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.020> clear<00:02:16.230> maps<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
like 15 pool on to clear maps because of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.410 
like 15 pool on to clear maps because of
how<00:02:17.250> easy<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:17.970> away<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.240> nearly

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
how easy it is to get away with nearly

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.850 
how easy it is to get away with nearly
cool<00:02:18.630> cuz<00:02:18.870> you'll<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> scalp<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.880> bo<00:02:21.240> is

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
cool cuz you'll have the scalp but bo is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.170 
cool cuz you'll have the scalp but bo is
maybe<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> real<00:02:23.430> hashtag<00:02:23.820> gambler

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
maybe this is the real hashtag gambler

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780 
maybe this is the real hashtag gambler
who<00:02:24.480> has<00:02:24.780> decided<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.980> hatch<00:02:26.190> first<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.700> the

seems to be like this ongoing threat but

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.550 
seems to be like this ongoing threat but
people<00:02:39.060> who<00:02:39.210> make<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.570> into<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> WCS<00:02:40.530> season

would<00:04:55.900> have<00:04:55.990> walked<00:04:56.230> across<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.650> map<00:04:56.800> you

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
would have walked across the map you

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.740 
would have walked across the map you
would<00:04:57.040> have<00:04:57.130> also<00:04:57.370> lost<00:04:57.490> everything<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.210> at

would have also lost everything and at

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.700 
would have also lost everything and at
least<00:04:58.870> thing<00:04:59.050> would<00:04:59.140> have<00:04:59.260> killed<00:04:59.410> everything

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
and then maybe with a number maybe you

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.870 
and then maybe with a number maybe you
