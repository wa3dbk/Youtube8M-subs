strength to keep it really thin looks
like<00:00:46.500> aluminum<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.129> maybe<00:00:47.250> Kevlar<00:00:47.730> together

over<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> circuitry<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> prevent<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.940> from

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
over the circuitry to prevent it from

over the circuitry to prevent it from
getting<00:00:54.360> wet<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> thought<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.530> pretty

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
getting wet so I thought that was pretty

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
getting wet so I thought that was pretty
neat<00:00:55.980> along<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> screen<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.780> has<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> dual

there we go

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.510 
there we go
this<00:04:26.110> should<00:04:26.289> be<00:04:26.409> really<00:04:26.590> nice<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.099> also<00:04:27.340> has<00:04:27.490> a

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
this should be really nice it also has a

content<00:06:06.159> like<00:06:06.279> you've<00:06:06.430> never<00:06:06.550> seen<00:06:06.789> it<00:06:06.849> before

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.029 
content like you've never seen it before

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:10.680 
content like you've never seen it before
so<00:06:07.479> it<00:06:07.990> does<00:06:08.139> output<00:06:08.529> 1080p<00:06:09.300> from<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.419> spec

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
so it does output 1080p from the spec

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.409 
so it does output 1080p from the spec
list<00:06:10.960> anyway<00:06:11.349> and<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:12.099> side<00:06:12.339> here<00:06:12.669> they've

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
list anyway and the side here they've

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.950 
list anyway and the side here they've
changed<00:06:13.779> the<00:06:14.080> location<00:06:14.259> of<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:15.960> HD

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
changed the location of the HD

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.490 
changed the location of the HD
connections<00:06:17.529> so<00:06:17.919> for<00:06:18.879> the<00:06:19.089> charge<00:06:19.990> port<00:06:20.229> so<00:06:20.409> we

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
connections so for the charge port so we

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.089 
connections so for the charge port so we
slide<00:06:20.800> it<00:06:20.949> in<00:06:21.069> sideways<00:06:21.339> it's<00:06:22.029> it's<00:06:22.360> like<00:06:22.419> that
