00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the goal with just just boring and what

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.570 
the goal with just just boring and what
i<00:02:05.790> say<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> reefs<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
i say that is that from the reefs and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that guess what I a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.260

down<00:02:32.430> turns<00:02:32.760> left<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.270> then<00:02:33.450> give<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320

DeMaria<00:02:34.760> obviously<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.420> sweaty<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
DeMaria obviously go and sweaty it to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.370 
DeMaria obviously go and sweaty it to
name<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.770> then<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.130> make<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.640> lead<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.380> one

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
name and then we make that lead to one

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.790 
name and then we make that lead to one
so<00:02:40.980> yeah<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.430> was<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.670> first<00:02:42.090> game<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.800> would

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so yeah that was the first game I would

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.250 
so yeah that was the first game I would
say<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.340> good<00:02:44.580> first<00:02:44.910> win<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.540> hopefully

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
say it's a good first win and hopefully

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.320 
say it's a good first win and hopefully
we<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.770> go<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.190> win<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.700> our<00:02:47.820> next<00:02:48.090> few

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
we can go and get a win in our next few

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.150 
we can go and get a win in our next few
matches<00:02:48.480> maybe<00:02:48.870> even<00:02:49.110> win<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> term<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.100> that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
matches maybe even win the term and that

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.860 
matches maybe even win the term and that
would<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.610> absolutely<00:02:51.090> ridiculous<00:02:51.720> if

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
would just be absolutely ridiculous if

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.790 
would just be absolutely ridiculous if
we<00:02:51.990> could<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.070> yeah<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.020> we<00:02:55.170> move<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.500> our

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
we could so yeah so we move into our

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.680 
we could so yeah so we move into our
next<00:02:56.370> game<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:56.820> come<00:02:57.000> across<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.450> team

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
this is I didn't think it would be this

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.490 
this is I didn't think it would be this
easy<00:05:56.430> in<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.760> cup<00:05:57.090> but<00:05:57.750> he<00:05:57.870> managed<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.290> get

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
easy in this cup but he managed to get

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.180 
easy in this cup but he managed to get
another<00:05:58.980> console<00:05:59.550> a<00:05:59.640> consolation<00:06:00.390> goal<00:06:00.800> so<00:06:01.800> it

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
another console a consolation goal so it

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.040 
another console a consolation goal so it
was<00:06:02.640> 21<00:06:03.030> in<00:06:03.390> the<00:06:03.540> end<00:06:03.720> but<00:06:04.790> this<00:06:05.790> means<00:06:06.050> we

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
was 21 in the end but this means we

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.580 
was 21 in the end but this means we
managed<00:06:07.410> to<00:06:07.470> get<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:07.890> we<00:06:08.550> managed<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.880> win<00:06:09.590> the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
managed to get and we managed to win the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.730 
managed to get and we managed to win the
whole<00:06:11.160> cup<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:12.120> I'm<00:06:12.510> just<00:06:12.810> astounded<00:06:13.020> how<00:06:13.680> we

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
whole cup and I'm just astounded how we

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.290 
whole cup and I'm just astounded how we
hadn't<00:06:14.070> actually<00:06:14.220> managed<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:14.940> do<00:06:15.270> that

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
hadn't actually managed to do that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.580 
hadn't actually managed to do that
because<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.680> it<00:06:17.520> normally<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.540> try<00:06:19.110> and<00:06:19.350> plan

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
because is it normally I try and plan

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.290 
because is it normally I try and plan
some<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.919> cups<00:06:20.130> like<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.520> know<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.850> Irish<00:06:21.090> Cup

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
some the cups like I know the Irish Cup

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.570 
some the cups like I know the Irish Cup
was<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.510> little<00:06:21.750> bit<00:06:21.840> harder<00:06:22.169> because<00:06:22.580> there

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
was a little bit harder because there

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.980 
was a little bit harder because there
weren't<00:06:23.730> but<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.060> had<00:06:24.330> to<00:06:24.360> have<00:06:24.570> Irish

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
weren't but you had to have Irish

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.510 
weren't but you had to have Irish
players<00:06:25.230> but<00:06:25.590> to<00:06:25.770> be<00:06:25.890> honest<00:06:26.160> i<00:06:26.280> didn't<00:06:26.490> think

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
players but to be honest i didn't think

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.909 
players but to be honest i didn't think
i'd<00:06:26.730> be<00:06:26.880> this<00:06:26.910> easy<00:06:27.300> first<00:06:27.660> time<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.260> wasn't
