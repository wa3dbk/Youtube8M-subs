00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
cart well Liverpool are on you know

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.560 
cart well Liverpool are on you know
they're<00:02:16.430> talking<00:02:16.850> themselves<00:02:16.970> into<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
they're talking themselves into a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.210 
they're talking themselves into a
championship<00:02:18.140> contenders<00:02:18.650> at<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> moment

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
championship contenders at the moment

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.770 
championship contenders at the moment
they've<00:02:19.340> now<00:02:19.610> got<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> better<00:02:20.120> team<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.600> better

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
they've now got a better team a better

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
they've now got a better team a better
balanced<00:02:21.260> team<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.730> manager

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
balanced team I think the manager

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.270 
balanced team I think the manager
has<00:02:24.140> someone<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.320> had<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> serious<00:02:25.860> word<00:02:26.100> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
has someone has had a serious word and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.950 
has someone has had a serious word and
we've<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.700> rotation<00:02:27.420> thing<00:02:27.600> because<00:02:27.930> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
we've got this rotation thing because it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.010 
we've got this rotation thing because it
seems<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:30.020> structured

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
seems to be a much more structured

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.410 
seems to be a much more structured
approach<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.770> how<00:02:31.920> human<00:02:32.340> has<00:02:32.490> set<00:02:33.090> houses

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
approach to how human has set houses

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.720 
approach to how human has set houses
team<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.190> going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> walk

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
team and so it's not going to be a walk

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
team and so it's not going to be a walk
off<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.330> exciting<00:02:36.840> game<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.050> course<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
off with very exciting game of course I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.280 
off with very exciting game of course I
think<00:02:37.800> Chelsea<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.690> know<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> come<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
think Chelsea and you know to come to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.530 
think Chelsea and you know to come to
Stanford<00:02:40.500> reason<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.250> hope<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.460> win<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
Stanford reason to hope to win there is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
Stanford reason to hope to win there is
a<00:02:42.600> bit<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.990> dream<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.400> thought<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.910> big

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
a bit of a dream and I thought the big

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.540 
a bit of a dream and I thought the big
key<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:46.050> me<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.500> Chelsea<00:02:47.310> against

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
key thing for me was Chelsea against

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.970 
key thing for me was Chelsea against
Aston<00:02:47.970> Villa<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.570> lot<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.140> people<00:02:49.410> gave<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.950> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
Aston Villa a lot of people gave you a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.090 
Aston Villa a lot of people gave you a
real<00:02:50.400> chance<00:02:50.870> upsetting<00:02:51.870> Chelsea<00:02:52.800> at<00:02:52.890> home

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
real chance upsetting Chelsea at home

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.980 
real chance upsetting Chelsea at home
and<00:02:53.460> really<00:02:53.910> everybody<00:02:54.510> who's<00:02:54.720> ever<00:02:54.870> played

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
and really everybody who's ever played

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.960 
and really everybody who's ever played
I've<00:02:55.470> never<00:02:55.650> seen<00:02:55.770> chances<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.550> good<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:56.940> that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I've never seen chances so good in that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.400 
I've never seen chances so good in that
first<00:02:57.330> half<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:57.780> were<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.290> different

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
first half they were just in a different

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.740 
first half they were just in a different
planet<00:02:58.860> if<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.730> replicate<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.270> type

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
planet if they can replicate that type

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.040 
planet if they can replicate that type
of<00:03:00.780> performance<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.940> shows<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.870> get

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
of performance I think it shows we get

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.130 
of performance I think it shows we get
them<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.290> run<00:03:04.410> around<00:03:05.570> no<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.690> wants<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.959> see

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
them to run around no one wants to see

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.620 
them to run around no one wants to see
one<00:03:08.040> side<00:03:08.250> again<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.850> certainly<00:03:09.180> won't<00:03:09.450> be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
one side again and it certainly won't be

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.420 
one side again and it certainly won't be
a<00:03:09.660> one-sided<00:03:10.050> game<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.830> Liverpool<00:03:11.280> have

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
a one-sided game because Liverpool have

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.330 
a one-sided game because Liverpool have
a<00:03:11.459> lot<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> passion<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:13.050> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.190> the

a bit of a lunatic because I like losing
money<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.730> bed<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.269> seem<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.660> do<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.930> with<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
money on bed so I seem to do it with a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.729 
money on bed so I seem to do it with a
great<00:03:37.680> lot<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.890> frequency<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
great lot of frequency and I think and

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.120 
great lot of frequency and I think and
it<00:03:40.890> totally<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.550> bad<00:03:42.140> if<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.380> was<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> draw<00:03:43.800> no

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
it totally not bad if it was a draw no

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.060 
it totally not bad if it was a draw no
bet<00:03:44.160> I'd<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> feel<00:03:45.540> good

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.260 
bet I'd have a feel good
not<00:03:47.070> because<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.430> don't<00:03:47.490> like<00:03:47.760> Manchester

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.050 
beat Newcastle I think Newcastle rose to
the<00:04:34.410> occasion<00:04:34.440> against<00:04:35.190> men<00:04:35.460> city<00:04:35.730> but<00:04:36.030> a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
the occasion against men city but a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.730 
the occasion against men city but a
little<00:04:36.390> bit<00:04:36.510> fortunate<00:04:36.750> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.170> week<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.530> think

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.260 
little bit fortunate in the week I think
men<00:04:37.860> city<00:04:38.100> definitely<00:04:38.730> took<00:04:38.880> their<00:04:39.090> foot<00:04:39.210> off

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
like what went wrong against Chelsea

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.750
