Resnick confidently and with the state
at<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.189> time<00:01:52.689> let<00:01:53.689> me<00:01:53.719> start<00:01:54.049> with<00:01:54.110> some<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.409> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
at a time let me start with some of the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.490 
at a time let me start with some of the
letters<00:01:55.759> like<00:01:56.149> G<00:01:57.039> H<00:01:58.570> anyway<00:01:59.570> when<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:00.319> writing

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
letters like G H anyway when I'm writing

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.450 
letters like G H anyway when I'm writing
it<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:01.250> say<00:02:01.429> this<00:02:01.579> that<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.750> can<00:02:03.409> just<00:02:03.649> make

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it just say this that I can just make

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.209 
it just say this that I can just make
this<00:02:05.210> edge<00:02:05.539> like<00:02:05.929> this<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.469> it<00:02:06.710> looked<00:02:07.039> me

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
this edge like this and it looked me

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.180 
this edge like this and it looked me
like<00:02:07.460> eight<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.050> serial<00:02:09.349> number<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.590> H<00:02:09.830> is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
like eight so the serial number of H is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.890 
like eight so the serial number of H is
eight<00:02:10.989> now<00:02:11.989> I<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:14.390> write

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
eight now I we write

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.170 
eight now I we write
I<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.590> also<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.610> basically<00:02:16.970> means

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I like this also this basically means

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.589 
I like this also this basically means
the<00:02:17.630> serial<00:02:17.959> number<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:20.560> 9j<00:02:22.000> I'm<00:02:23.000> bothering<00:02:23.299> K

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
the serial number is 9j I'm bothering K

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.860 
the serial number is 9j I'm bothering K
now<00:02:23.890> okay<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.549> think<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.120> her<00:02:26.569> name

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
now okay you can just think of her name

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.000 
now okay you can just think of her name
like<00:02:27.110> kings<00:02:27.440> xi<00:02:28.099> if<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:29.150> are<00:02:29.720> over<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> Baikal

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
like kings xi if you are over a Baikal

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.729 
like kings xi if you are over a Baikal
term<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.400> India<00:02:31.730> then<00:02:32.060> King<00:02:32.329> Solomon<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.500> must

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
term of India then King Solomon you must

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.470 
term of India then King Solomon you must
have<00:02:33.890> heard<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.239> K<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.829> 11<00:02:38.140> now<00:02:39.140> L<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:41.239> of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
have heard of so K is 11 now L think of

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.220 
have heard of so K is 11 now L think of
L<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.230> can<00:02:42.319> just<00:02:42.739> write<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.880> also<00:02:44.230> you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
L you can just write like this also you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.699 
L you can just write like this also you
know<00:02:45.880> it'll<00:02:46.880> look<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.239> -<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.470> serial

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
know it'll look like - so it's serial

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.960 
know it'll look like - so it's serial
number<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.160> terms<00:02:51.430> think<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.579> em<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:55.459> Pfister

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
number is terms think of em just Pfister

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.259 
number is terms think of em just Pfister
em<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.389> this<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.100> look<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.340> this

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
em like this and it will look like this

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.610 
em like this and it will look like this
which<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.630> nothing<00:02:59.780> but<00:03:00.069> 3m<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.519> certain<00:03:02.620> for

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
which is nothing but 3m is certain for

who think of a number like 150 oh is 15

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.220 
who think of a number like 150 oh is 15
now

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
now

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.369 
now
if<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.440> will<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:15.580> make<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:16.150> line<00:03:16.629> over<00:03:16.840> here<00:03:17.170> and

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
if I will just make a line over here and

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.649 
if I will just make a line over here and
I<00:03:17.680> will<00:03:17.799> try<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.040> manipulate<00:03:18.280> up<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:19.060> design<00:03:19.629> a

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
I will try to manipulate up it design a

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.690 
I will try to manipulate up it design a
bit<00:03:19.959> it'll<00:03:20.200> look<00:03:20.409> more<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.920> eight<00:03:21.129> so

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
bit it'll look more like eight so

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.860 
bit it'll look more like eight so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.190 

and<00:03:26.220> things<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.459> just<00:03:27.879> try<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> make<00:03:29.170> a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
and things like that just try to make a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.740 
and things like that just try to make a
line<00:03:29.560> over<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.250> try<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.209> make<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.420> figure

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
line over here and try to make a figure

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.399 
line over here and try to make a figure
it'll<00:03:31.900> look<00:03:32.080> like<00:03:32.319> mine<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.099> it'll<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.400> Nitin<00:03:33.790> I

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
it'll look like mine so it'll be Nitin I

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.360 
it'll look like mine so it'll be Nitin I
believe<00:03:35.409> you<00:03:35.500> understand<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.099> these<00:03:36.220> are

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
not rules these are techniques you might

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.949 
not rules these are techniques you might
have<00:03:38.920> your<00:03:39.099> own<00:03:39.340> innovations<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.900> are

getting a better way please let me know

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.080 
getting a better way please let me know
now<00:03:44.370> 40<00:03:45.690> think<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.069> 2020<00:03:48.069> Kem<00:03:48.250> what<00:03:48.730> we<00:03:48.909> say

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
now 40 think of the 2020 Kem what we say

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.369 
now 40 think of the 2020 Kem what we say
these<00:03:49.299> days<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.780> t20<00:03:50.379> games

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
these days as t20 games

00:03:52.379 --> 00:04:01.000 
these days as t20 games
t20<00:03:53.379> cricket<00:03:54.090> twenty20<00:03:55.090> cricket

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:12.210 

so<00:04:01.879> T<00:04:02.420> is<00:04:02.720> 20

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:25.450 

No

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.310 

okay<00:04:26.460> now<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.539> can<00:04:30.720> just<00:04:30.930> think<00:04:31.139> of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
okay now for you you can just think of

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.070 
okay now for you you can just think of
something<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.160> term<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:32.850> take<00:04:33.080> new

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
something like you term that we take new

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.110 
something like you term that we take new
tongue<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.680> don't<00:04:35.490> know<00:04:35.880> how<00:04:36.509> but<00:04:36.900> he<00:04:38.120> listens

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
tongue I don't know how but he listens

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.939 
tongue I don't know how but he listens
to<00:04:39.180> me<00:04:39.419> Ivan<00:04:39.750> hears<00:04:40.110> sounds<00:04:40.800> me<00:04:40.949> like<00:04:41.130> 21v<00:04:45.949> the

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
to me Ivan hears sounds me like 21v the

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.090 
to me Ivan hears sounds me like 21v the
ncb<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.580> having<00:04:47.880> two<00:04:48.060> parts<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.680> will<00:04:49.919> say

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
ncb is having two parts so I will say

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.670 
ncb is having two parts so I will say
this<00:04:50.250> as<00:04:52.220> 22w<00:04:54.080> again<00:04:55.080> inverter<00:04:55.680> w<00:04:56.070> like<00:04:56.250> this

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
this as 22w again inverter w like this

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.320 
this as 22w again inverter w like this
something<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.070> it'll<00:04:59.550> look<00:04:59.820> like<00:05:00.060> this

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
something like that it'll look like this

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.810 
something like that it'll look like this
again<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.320> looking<00:05:01.530> like<00:05:01.800> three<00:05:02.099> so<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.669> is

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
again it's looking like three so this is

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.089 
again it's looking like three so this is
23<00:05:04.220> then<00:05:05.220> for<00:05:05.460> example<00:05:05.550> X<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.660> mean<00:05:06.690> X<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.949> can

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
23 then for example X I mean X you can

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.300 
23 then for example X I mean X you can
border<00:05:08.430> X<00:05:08.699> is<00:05:08.880> having<00:05:09.150> 1<00:05:09.389> 2<00:05:09.630> 3<00:05:10.110> &amp;<00:05:10.440> 4<00:05:10.500> there<00:05:11.220> are<00:05:11.250> 4

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
border X is having 1 2 3 &amp; 4 there are 4

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.990 
border X is having 1 2 3 &amp; 4 there are 4
parts

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
parts

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.790 
parts
so<00:05:12.810> X<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.310> 24<00:05:15.560> I'm<00:05:16.560> left<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:18.320> J<00:05:20.210> now<00:05:21.800> for

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
so X is 24 I'm left with this J now for

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.730 
so X is 24 I'm left with this J now for
day<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.860> can<00:05:26.039> just<00:05:26.250> remember<00:05:26.669> our<00:05:27.409> name<00:05:28.409> like

name of one of the film stars or you can

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.010 
name of one of the film stars or you can
just<00:05:38.280> borrow<00:05:38.550> some<00:05:38.760> some<00:05:39.389> of<00:05:39.510> your<00:05:39.659> friends

just borrow some some of your friends
name<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.409> something<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.099> this<00:05:41.520> term<00:05:42.000> this

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
name and something so this term this

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.820 
name and something so this term this
this<00:05:42.840> t10<00:05:43.229> does<00:05:43.440> 10<00:05:43.710> J<00:05:44.669> it's<00:05:45.030> 10

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
this t10 does 10 J it's 10

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.629 
this t10 does 10 J it's 10
similarly<00:05:46.830> for<00:05:47.130> P<00:05:48.169> you<00:05:49.169> can<00:05:49.409> build<00:05:50.159> some

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
similarly for P you can build some

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.610 
similarly for P you can build some
inverse<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.210> P<00:05:51.539> that<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:52.050> are<00:05:52.139> making<00:05:52.380> it

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
inverse on a P that you are making it

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.909 
inverse on a P that you are making it
like<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:52.949> or<00:05:53.250> something<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:55.560> will<00:05:55.710> first

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
like that or something and it will first

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.100 
like that or something and it will first
become<00:05:56.280> like<00:05:56.460> this<00:05:56.639> then<00:05:57.479> turn<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.050> that

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
become like this then turn it like that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.290 
become like this then turn it like that
something<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:58.830> do<00:05:58.949> from<00:05:59.610> your<00:05:59.639> site<00:06:00.000> so<00:06:00.270> that

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
something you do from your site so that

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.820 
something you do from your site so that
it<00:06:00.570> look<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.990> like<00:06:01.169> 16<00:06:02.030> you<00:06:03.030> know<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.599> is<00:06:03.870> B

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
it look you like 16 you know this is B

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.700 
it look you like 16 you know this is B
and<00:06:05.099> this<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.759> P<00:06:06.030> kind<00:06:06.419> of<00:06:06.570> thing<00:06:06.750> this<00:06:07.110> B<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.560> P
