00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.190
 This is an aluminum keyboard gamer and this is an aluminum keyboard healthy 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.120
 a person is wireless and 3 times cheaper than a brine e60 720 and with what brine is good so 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.790
 it is with a design all neatly thin and without extra details the keyboard is small 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.630
 light and thin which distinguishes it from the hefty keyboards that we all 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.309
 accustomed to the aluminum substrate everything else is of matte plastic which 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.600
 pleasant to the touch and does not allow fingers to slide off due to the fact that such words 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.219
 thin she bends a little but not critical shorter appearance of materials and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 assembly I liked the keyboard works on bluetooth and only on 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
 bluetooth it hints at the fact that it is designed for tablets, moreover 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 Mostly for tablets, novelties, this is indicated by the fact that there is a button 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.120
 windows give the touchpad supports all Hungarian movements for example with you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 three fingers to go backward to browsers or slide two fingers to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.470
 up and down movement however it does not interfere with use 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 keyboard not only with devices on Windows but also on other operating systems to that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 You can use it not only with tablets, but with all devices where there is bluetooth 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.509
 You can even connect the bluetooth adapter to the TV 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.860
 and for tes it is very convenient 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
 the grass needs to be said that the keyboard is not suitable for typing large texts 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 for compactness, the buttons are shifted from the usual positions and blind dialing is doomed 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 to failure as well as not blind especially in the first 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 a couple of days until you get used to that right shift passed for arrows 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 enter is small and due to the huge caps lock and the left shift two rows of buttons 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 confused rights in the other side to communicate in social networks and work with the browser 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.909
 in the TV and this is a great option buttons though small but fall on 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.390
 they are not difficult responsiveness they have excellent 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.979
 the distance between the keys will not allow you to press two buttons at the same time and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.509
 having a touchpad makes it easy to work alone can confuse the rubber 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.890
 the legs are only on the sides and not in the center so when you type on the table 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.850
 then the keyboard flexes but to be honest is much nicer and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 more convenient to use it when she is on her knees 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.170
 It works the whole thing from the battery that charges an hour and keeps the charge 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 at least a week with normal use for those who do not like white 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 color or for people with a more practical approach klava is in the black light 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.489
 so lazy as I find it difficult to get out of bed make it quieter or 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.260
 rewind the movie and designed this keyboard if you need a wireless 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.970
 keyboard for tablet or telephones for social networking or surfing in 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.859
 On the Internet, look at the crab, especially since it is in any interior 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.670
