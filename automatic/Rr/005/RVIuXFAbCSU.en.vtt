00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello to everyone today i will show you a review 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:16.049
 sneaker jordan 11 retro 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 coloring play-off or as now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.170
 it is customary to talk about nonsense that is 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.849
 reduced 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 black &amp; red red-black black and red 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:36.770
 this is the 2001 edition of the first reprint 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 that is, 1 retro 11 sneakers and here they are 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.360
 must up to today of course 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 they are already tired 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.610
 I sing zones but still pretty good 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610
 look 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.329
 I also wanted to report this pattern 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.519
 some differences fake from the original 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.859
 which can be and very often 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.740
 when people buy babes think that 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:11.240
 This is the original but a general view of sneakers. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.970
 principle started the hour from following 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.479
 reissued in 2008 2012 earlier 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:25.179
 in my review it is already there 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.179
 retro dance 2012 reissue 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.539
 the contrast of 2001 2012 will be with 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 these these reptiles compare what 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:41.530
 the quality is much here much 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.289
 I emphasize many times better 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.990
 subsequent reprint will specifically be in 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:53.420
 2012 2008 I will not harry so they do not 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:58.840
 it was 2012 will be very soft very 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 soft patent leather is the same 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.500
 here on the backdrop 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.719
 the author here is the principle exactly the same 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.660
 number 23 also podpis and same thing 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.099
 the ball in this gap looks 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.239
 It is on because it will not be noticeable but as 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.680
 2001 , the sole is sissoko red 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:36.480
 it is a little bit darker than re-release 2012 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:49.799
 the gate is slightly lighter than the carbon 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:53.670
 plate us here such a view like this i 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:58.880
 lined up in advance to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:05.989
 show the inner world here such laces 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.989
 thick in all shipments they are identical 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:20.150
 the inside is made of wool 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.620
 compacted and subsequent cry searches there 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.470
 no longer 6 there is another material more 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.940
 soft how to say it is softer and suddenly 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.830
 material in general is another material 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:44.300
 wool self understand and much 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:52.580
 better standing want to say so 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.690
 This is about the stacks of the insole. 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.950
 was 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.680
 perezalit thousands of the first year that's taken into account 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.200
 peeled off 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.080
 also the material is much better and much 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.860
 better than what it is doing now too 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.860
 read and fingers and 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:26.050
 such material no longer do about 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:28.060
 differences by the way there is no point which 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.650
 there are other models in all 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:37.630
 giorno models 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:40.090
 but exactly here is the hole so 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 I want to say the difference between water fake and 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.560
 of the original 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.280
 number 23 should be just that 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.390
 not narrow ball should 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.150
 looks to be at the level of the gap 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.550
 between two and three the center should 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.200
 be a patient that is this here 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:06.450
 elevation even be exactly centered 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:16.200
 equal name jump and jordan 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:16.200
 must be at level 3 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.650
 resident Shitova materials grandparent 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.120
 possibly sexual in the third compartment 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:33.669
 should be this inscription go to x on 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.669
 right for 4 though do and rub so and 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.020
 the most basic is carbon in fake 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:51.620
 carbon fiber no ruled out just rubber 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.190
 decked out there other material 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.940
 fakes 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:01.190
 in the original there is even such a hole 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:06.550
 hole and stamp the license stamp than 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.550
 show that this diagram will be seen 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.169
 funny camera can't 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:29.740
 what 2001 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:34.300
 but people 23 10 1 year from ending just 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:38.460
 super mega bomb you never spend on 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.040
 don't lose your fashion 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.750
 Unisex can be said to mark as 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.930
 girls and guys that principle is not 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.710
 do eat and female building such 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.710
 running shoes 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:59.940
 very good beauty teaches and what they 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.870
 the original 2000 1996 were released 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.620
