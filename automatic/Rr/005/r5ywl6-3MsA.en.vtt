in<00:00:04.770> Minecraft<00:00:05.279> we're<00:00:05.970> still<00:00:06.210> working<00:00:06.390> towards

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
in Minecraft we're still working towards

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.900 
in Minecraft we're still working towards
building<00:00:07.230> our<00:00:07.500> solar<00:00:07.740> panels<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.790> that

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
building our solar panels and for that

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.790 
building our solar panels and for that
we're<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.510> need<00:00:09.750> another<00:00:10.260> Greg<00:00:10.530> tech

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
we're going to need another Greg tech

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.830 
we're going to need another Greg tech
machine<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.910> machine<00:00:11.940> we're<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> need

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
machine the machine we're going to need

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.499 
machine the machine we're going to need
is<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.650> industrial<00:00:14.219> blast<00:00:14.429> furnace<00:00:14.880> now

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is this the industrial blast furnace now

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.480 
is this the industrial blast furnace now
this<00:00:15.750> does<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.170> several<00:00:16.440> uses<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> Greg<00:00:17.220> tech

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this does have several uses in Greg tech

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
this does have several uses in Greg tech
but<00:00:17.820> specifically<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.810> wanted<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
but specifically what we wanted for is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.160 
but specifically what we wanted for is
turning<00:00:20.310> our<00:00:20.400> silicon<00:00:20.850> cells<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.750> silicon

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
turning our silicon cells into silicon

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
turning our silicon cells into silicon
plates<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.220> make<00:00:23.340> our<00:00:23.490> solar<00:00:23.760> panels

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
plates so we can make our solar panels

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.779 
plates so we can make our solar panels
don't<00:00:24.930> let<00:00:25.109> its<00:00:25.289> small<00:00:25.619> size<00:00:25.890> fool<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
don't let its small size fool you this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.269 
don't let its small size fool you this
is<00:00:26.970> only<00:00:27.119> part<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> machine<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.680> let's<00:00:29.099> go

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
is only part of the machine so let's go

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880

get<00:01:01.649> nickel<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:03.199> macerating<00:01:04.199> ferrous<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
get nickel by macerating ferrous or so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
get nickel by macerating ferrous or so
you'll<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.150> mining<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.780> some<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you'll have to go mining to get some of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
you'll have to go mining to get some of
that<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.830> they're<00:01:08.070> quite<00:01:08.369> easy<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:08.939> once

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that but they're quite easy to make once

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.910 
that but they're quite easy to make once
you<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> ingredients<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.740> put

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you have the ingredients and we put

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
you have the ingredients and we put
those<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> remaining<00:01:11.610> slots<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.659> have

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
those in the remaining slots and we have

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
those in the remaining slots and we have
ourselves<00:01:12.990> an<00:01:13.470> industry<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.130> blast<00:01:14.340> furnace

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
ourselves an industry or blast furnace

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
ourselves an industry or blast furnace
which<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> medium<00:01:16.380> voltage

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
which as you can see is a medium voltage

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.060 
which as you can see is a medium voltage
machine<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.920> what<00:01:19.920> you're

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
machine so let's take that what you're

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
machine so let's take that what you're
also<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> need<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:21.320> 34<00:01:22.320> standard

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
also going to need are 34 standard

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640 
also going to need are 34 standard
machine<00:01:23.369> casings<00:01:24.119> again<00:01:24.600> quite<00:01:24.930> easy<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.470> make

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

with<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> machines<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
with the machines that we have at the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600 
with the machines that we have at the
moment<00:01:27.560> you're<00:01:28.560> also<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
moment you're also going to need for

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
moment you're also going to need for
this<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.880> well<00:01:30.049> two<00:01:31.049> buckets<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.560> lava<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.189> make

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this as well two buckets of lava so make

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
this as well two buckets of lava so make
sure<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.790> find<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.180> before<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> start

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
sure you find those before you start

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.420 
sure you find those before you start
let's<00:01:34.920> head<00:01:35.100> outside

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
let's head outside

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.120 
let's head outside
okay<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.840> reason<00:01:37.990> I've<00:01:38.230> come<00:01:38.410> out<00:01:38.560> here<00:01:38.860> is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
okay so the reason I've come out here is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.010 
okay so the reason I've come out here is
the<00:01:39.340> industrial<00:01:39.730> blast<00:01:39.970> furnace<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.660> actually

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
the industrial blast furnace is actually

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.900 
the industrial blast furnace is actually
a<00:01:41.050> larger<00:01:41.470> machine<00:01:41.830> than<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.220> single<00:01:42.520> block

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
a larger machine than a single block

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.510 
a larger machine than a single block
it's<00:01:43.510> one<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.930> multi-block<00:01:44.410> machines<00:01:44.830> so

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
it's one of the multi-block machines so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.980 
it's one of the multi-block machines so
I'm<00:01:45.820> going<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.060> build<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.330> outside<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.720> this

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
I'm going to build it outside in this

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.590 
I'm going to build it outside in this
clearing<00:01:47.260> as<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:48.190> can<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.520> here<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.970> have<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
clearing as you can see here I have a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.040 
clearing as you can see here I have a
fully<00:01:50.200> charged<00:01:50.650> MFE<00:01:51.190> running<00:01:52.000> on<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.390> bank<00:01:52.840> of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
fully charged MFE running on a bank of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.950 
fully charged MFE running on a bank of
six<00:01:53.830> generators<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.970> will<00:01:55.120> explain<00:01:55.540> why

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
six generators and I will explain why

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.280 
six generators and I will explain why
later<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.160> let's<00:01:57.640> build<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.450> basis<00:01:59.170> for

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
later on so let's build the basis for

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.840 
later on so let's build the basis for
the<00:01:59.410> industrial<00:01:59.770> blast<00:01:59.979> furnace<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.610> begin

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the industrial blast furnace to begin

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.480 
the industrial blast furnace to begin
with<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.720> need<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.990> take<00:02:02.140> our<00:02:02.410> standard<00:02:03.280> blast

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
with we need to take our standard blast

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.390 
with we need to take our standard blast
casing<00:02:03.940> on<00:02:04.119> machine<00:02:04.900> casing<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:06.070> need<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
casing on machine casing and we need to

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.310 
casing on machine casing and we need to
lay<00:02:06.550> out<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.150> ground<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:08.280> 3<00:02:09.280> by<00:02:09.459> 3<00:02:10.020> block<00:02:11.020> and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
lay out on the ground a 3 by 3 block and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.440 
lay out on the ground a 3 by 3 block and
make<00:02:11.890> sure<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> middle<00:02:12.550> one<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.910> filled

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
make sure that the middle one is filled

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.320 
make sure that the middle one is filled
in<00:02:13.630> as<00:02:13.750> well<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.459> size<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.060> our

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
in as well so that is the size that our

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.180 
in as well so that is the size that our
industrial<00:02:17.140> blast<00:02:17.350> furnace<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.770> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.070> be

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
industrial blast furnace is going to be

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.940 
industrial blast furnace is going to be
and<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.850> needs<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.239> be<00:02:19.330> four<00:02:19.660> high<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
and this needs to be four high now the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.360 
and this needs to be four high now the
middle<00:02:21.220> two<00:02:21.400> blocks<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:23.350> second<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
middle two blocks on the second and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.570 
middle two blocks on the second and
third<00:02:24.430> rows<00:02:24.970> need<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.989> be<00:02:26.170> empty<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.370> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
third rows need to be empty for this to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.440 
third rows need to be empty for this to
work<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.130> leave<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.550> block<00:02:30.820> empty<00:02:31.270> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
work so if we leave this block empty and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.820 
work so if we leave this block empty and
then<00:02:31.600> build<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> next<00:02:32.350> level<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.650> leave

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
then build up the next level and leave

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
then build up the next level and leave
that<00:02:33.010> empty<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.910> will<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.300> absolutely<00:02:34.810> fine

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that empty it will be absolutely fine

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.650 
that empty it will be absolutely fine
but<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:35.980> are<00:02:36.010> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.489> do<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.940> we're

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
but what we are going to do is we're

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.150 
but what we are going to do is we're
going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.930> take<00:02:37.989> our<00:02:38.170> two<00:02:38.470> buckets<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.950> lava

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
going to take our two buckets of lava

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.430 
going to take our two buckets of lava
and<00:02:39.459> we're<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.390> fill<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.989> middle

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and we're going to fill that middle

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.380 
and we're going to fill that middle
space<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> bucket<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.580> lava<00:02:42.820> I'll<00:02:43.180> explain

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
space with a bucket of lava I'll explain

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.690 
space with a bucket of lava I'll explain
why<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.989> moment<00:02:44.140> let's<00:02:45.040> build<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> second

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
why in a moment let's build the second

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.580 
why in a moment let's build the second
level<00:02:45.820> be<00:02:46.780> careful<00:02:47.170> when<00:02:47.320> you're<00:02:47.410> building

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
level be careful when you're building

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.030 
level be careful when you're building
this<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.250> fall<00:02:48.430> into<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.850> lava<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.890> is

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
this not to fall into the lava it is

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.130 
this not to fall into the lava it is
easily<00:02:51.280> done<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.910> have<00:02:52.030> done<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.269> myself<00:02:52.360> so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
easily done and I have done it myself so

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.680 
easily done and I have done it myself so
there<00:02:53.500> we<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.680> let's<00:02:54.190> fill<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:55.420> with

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
there we go let's fill that one in with

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.420 
there we go let's fill that one in with
a<00:02:55.720> lava<00:02:55.959> block<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.350> well<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.739> then<00:02:57.280> we're

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
a lava block as well and then we're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.930 
a lava block as well and then we're
going<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.670> take<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.180> remaining<00:02:58.540> nine<00:02:59.940> machine

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
going to take the remaining nine machine

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.460 
going to take the remaining nine machine
case<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.330> blocks<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.430> fill<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.670> spaces<00:03:04.470> so

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
case in blocks and fill in the spaces so

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.780 
case in blocks and fill in the spaces so
like<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.739> said<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:06.070> leave<00:03:06.400> those<00:03:06.549> middle

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
like I said you can leave those middle

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.009 
like I said you can leave those middle
blocks<00:03:06.970> empty<00:03:07.299> but<00:03:07.420> I'm<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.630> explain

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
blocks empty but I'm going to explain

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.710 
blocks empty but I'm going to explain
why<00:03:08.380> we've<00:03:08.590> put<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.890> larvae<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.310> there<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.180> we

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
why we've put the larvae in there so we

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360 
why we've put the larvae in there so we
now<00:03:10.870> take<00:03:10.930> home<00:03:11.290> industrial<00:03:11.709> glass<00:03:11.890> furnace

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
now take home industrial glass furnace

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.970 
now take home industrial glass furnace
and<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:13.180> rules<00:03:13.750> for<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.080> I'll<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.530> must<00:03:14.799> go

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
and the rules for this I'll it must go

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.820 
and the rules for this I'll it must go
along<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> bottom<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.810> must<00:03:17.110> go<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
along the bottom it must go in the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.190 
along the bottom it must go in the
middle<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:19.150> front<00:03:19.420> must<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.959> facing

middle and the front must be facing
outwards<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:20.980> providing<00:03:21.549> we're<00:03:21.730> facing<00:03:22.180> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
outwards so providing we're facing the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.199 
outwards so providing we're facing the
blast<00:03:22.900> furnace<00:03:23.079> if<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.590> drop<00:03:23.799> it<00:03:23.980> down<00:03:24.220> there

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
blast furnace if we drop it down there

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.360 
blast furnace if we drop it down there
it's<00:03:25.720> facing<00:03:26.200> us<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.950> right<00:03:27.070> place

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
it's facing us it's in the right place

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.910 
it's facing us it's in the right place
I'm<00:03:28.360> going<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.930> quickly<00:03:29.380> get<00:03:29.590> rid<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.799> those

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
metals as well but it'll do for what we

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
supply of power is what you really need

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.560 
supply of power is what you really need
here<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.610> if<00:04:45.669> we<00:04:45.760> go<00:04:45.880> into<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.180> interface

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
here so if we go into the interface

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.020 
here so if we go into the interface
we've<00:04:47.140> got<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.410> input<00:04:48.190> slots<00:04:48.490> because<00:04:48.669> some

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
we've got to input slots because some

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.750 
we've got to input slots because some
recipes<00:04:49.479> do<00:04:49.870> require<00:04:50.410> multiple<00:04:51.370> ingredients

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760

but<00:04:52.270> all<00:04:52.419> we<00:04:52.570> want<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.840> do<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.260> take<00:04:53.830> our

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
but all we want to do is take our

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.920 
but all we want to do is take our
silicon<00:04:54.430> cells<00:04:54.729> which<00:04:54.940> we<00:04:55.090> made<00:04:55.240> last<00:04:55.419> episode

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
silicon cells which we made last episode

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.740 
silicon cells which we made last episode
and<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:57.130> requires<00:04:57.490> two<00:04:57.760> at<00:04:57.880> a<00:04:57.970> time<00:04:58.000> if<00:04:58.419> we<00:04:58.539> pop

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
and it requires two at a time if we pop

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.630 
and it requires two at a time if we pop
two<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.680> see<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.919> starting<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.340> work

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
two in you can see it starting to work

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.260 
two in you can see it starting to work
let's<00:05:01.419> give<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> few<00:05:01.990> seconds<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:03.270> there

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
let's give that a few seconds and there

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.940 
let's give that a few seconds and there
you<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.600> as<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.930> result<00:05:05.410> we<00:05:05.650> have<00:05:05.680> our

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
you have it as a result we have our

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.950 
you have it as a result we have our
silicon<00:05:06.370> plate<00:05:06.640> which<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.180> can<00:05:07.419> use<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.690> make

our solar panels it also returns to

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.510 
our solar panels it also returns to
empty<00:05:11.020> cells<00:05:11.260> which<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.919> put<00:05:12.100> back<00:05:12.310> into

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
empty cells which we can put back into

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.700 
empty cells which we can put back into
our<00:05:12.789> industrial<00:05:13.360> centrifuge<00:05:13.690> with<00:05:14.380> some
