at<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.279> dermatologists<00:00:30.939> office<00:00:31.029> we<00:00:31.960> have

at a dermatologists office we have

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.389 
at a dermatologists office we have
figured<00:00:32.259> out<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.739> hard<00:00:32.950> science<00:00:33.280> we<00:00:33.370> have

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
figured out the hard science we have

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.549 
figured out the hard science we have
broken<00:00:33.640> through<00:00:33.880> is<00:00:34.180> that<00:00:34.239> they<00:00:35.079> figured<00:00:35.440> out

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
broken through is that they figured out

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.610 
broken through is that they figured out
how<00:00:35.860> visible<00:00:36.370> light<00:00:36.730> can<00:00:37.480> be<00:00:37.510> used<00:00:37.900> to<00:00:38.170> look

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
how visible light can be used to look

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.590 
how visible light can be used to look
underneath<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.220> surface<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.730> skin<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.450> we

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
underneath the surface of the skin so we

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.480 
underneath the surface of the skin so we
can<00:00:40.750> see<00:00:40.960> things<00:00:41.170> like<00:00:41.320> oil<00:00:41.680> glands<00:00:41.980> activity

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
can see things like oil glands activity

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.220 
can see things like oil glands activity
levels<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:42.910> oil<00:00:43.060> glands<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.510> can<00:00:43.840> tell<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.080> how

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
levels and oil glands I can tell you how

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.740 
levels and oil glands I can tell you how
