zig-zag stitch now the difference in

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.910 
zig-zag stitch now the difference in
free<00:02:13.040> motion<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.880> regular<00:02:14.890> zig-zag<00:02:15.890> stitch

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
free motion and regular zig-zag stitch

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.539 
free motion and regular zig-zag stitch
is<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.480> charge<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:18.110> how<00:02:18.620> long<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.310> stitch

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
is I'm in charge of how long the stitch

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.240 
is I'm in charge of how long the stitch
is<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.209> move<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.600> fabric<00:02:20.810> quickly<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.709> will

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
is if I move the fabric quickly I will

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.449 
is if I move the fabric quickly I will
get<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.549> zigzag<00:02:23.060> if<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.510> move<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.870> slowly<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:25.040> will

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
get a zigzag if I move it slowly I will

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.720 
get a zigzag if I move it slowly I will
get<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> satin<00:02:26.239> stitch<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:28.070> I'm<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.400> up

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
get a satin stitch and when I'm going up

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.640 
get a satin stitch and when I'm going up
and<00:02:28.970> down

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and down

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.199 
and down
I<00:02:30.709> would<00:02:31.340> get<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> thick<00:02:31.849> stitch

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
I would get a thick stitch

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.380 
I would get a thick stitch
however<00:02:34.989> if<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.590> move<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.920> side<00:02:36.189> to<00:02:36.219> side<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:37.090> get

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
however if I move it side to side I get

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.680 
however if I move it side to side I get
a<00:02:37.420> thin<00:02:37.750> stitch

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.510 

so<00:02:41.690> essentially<00:02:42.110> what<00:02:42.380> I've<00:02:42.530> done<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:43.130> turn

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
so essentially what I've done is turn

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.320 
so essentially what I've done is turn
this<00:02:43.910> needle<00:02:44.360> into<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.750> chisel<00:02:45.200> point<00:02:45.470> marker

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
this needle into a chisel point marker

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.910 
this needle into a chisel point marker
you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.780> very<00:02:48.140> smooth<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
you can do this very smooth and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190 
you can do this very smooth and
regulated<00:02:49.490> or<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.880> can<00:02:50.030> go<00:02:50.210> crazy<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
regulated or you can go crazy with it I

stabilized I have two layers of stable

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.130 
stabilized I have two layers of stable
stuff<00:03:07.610> under<00:03:07.940> here<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.420> now<00:03:09.230> when<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.470> go<00:03:09.709> up

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
stuff under here and now when I go up

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.830 
stuff under here and now when I go up
this<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.620> going<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.430> as<00:03:13.880> smooth<00:03:14.450> as

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
this is going to be as smooth as

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.559 
this is going to be as smooth as
possible

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.940 

and<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.799> always<00:03:20.040> come<00:03:20.670> back<00:03:20.939> down<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.950> think

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
and I can always come back down I think

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.490 
and I can always come back down I think
it<00:03:23.040> needs<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.519> filled<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.000> more<00:03:24.359> I'm<00:03:25.109> moving

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500

it needs to be filled in more I'm moving
it<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:25.859> slowly<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.900> here's<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.319> difference

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
it very slowly but here's the difference

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.530 
it very slowly but here's the difference
I'm<00:03:28.950> going<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:29.189> go<00:03:29.310> side<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.609> side<00:03:29.819> for<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
I'm going to go side to side for the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.880 
I'm going to go side to side for the
bottom<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.049> beam<00:03:31.459> I'm<00:03:32.459> going<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> come<00:03:32.939> up

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.520 

when<00:03:39.400> I'm<00:03:39.490> going<00:03:39.700> side<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.000> side<00:03:40.210> it's<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:41.050> up

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
when I'm going side to side it's then up

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.559 
when I'm going side to side it's then up
and<00:03:42.400> down<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.790> thick

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569

leaf I have done a program satin stitch

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.459 
leaf I have done a program satin stitch
and<00:04:50.069> I've<00:04:50.219> left<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.759> stitch<00:04:51.060> width<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.199> same

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
and I've left the stitch width the same

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.100 
and I've left the stitch width the same
I've<00:04:53.430> also<00:04:53.759> done<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> satin<00:04:54.629> stitch<00:04:54.659> where<00:04:55.080> I

I've also done a satin stitch where I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.499 
I've also done a satin stitch where I
varied<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.830> width<00:04:56.069> while<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.759> sewing<00:04:57.000> and

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
varied the width while I was sewing and

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.670 
varied the width while I was sewing and
then<00:04:58.229> this<00:04:58.710> gives<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.159> a<00:04:59.189> very<00:04:59.460> defined<00:05:00.120> edge

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
then this gives you a very defined edge

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.980 
then this gives you a very defined edge
however<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:02.069> the<00:05:02.280> background<00:05:02.849> cross<00:05:03.330> here<00:05:03.810> I
