00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.390
 today 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.370
 That day 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.459
 she wishes welcome to this training of the top beach application 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 under the evening system 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.479
 the victims always have goals of this application 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.740
 then little by little to his concrete we proceeded then some points 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.179
 particulars about pedagogical choices they ended up winding up a conclusion 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.189
 workforce 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.070
 its simple is to better know the solar system 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 eventually understand it because they are constantly 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 the agent makes it possible to make applications after imprisonment 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.280
 legault 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 interactive 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.530
 it must be pointed out that one can not represent eight planets of the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.340
 solar system and the sun 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.830
 respecting the scales is a photo montage that does not correspond with 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.350
 reality 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.340
 whatever it may be 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 unable to appear prefers same entity 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.490
 nor by flying over the different instances 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 we can retain different information 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.230
 some notes 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.920
 rice results 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 the diameter 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.440
 in kilometers 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.930
 the distance to the sun in millions of kilometers 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.740
 damascus relatively jupiter with 318 times more massive than the earth 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.260
 speed generates average at 13 kilometers per second compared to 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.350
 other children of the earth 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.420
 rotation around the sun 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330
 rotation on itself 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 intensity and average surface temperature 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.250
 so the purpose of this app is to understand the law of gravity 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800
 stated by newton 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.630
 and its consequences 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.180
 I was very good about relationships different sizes such as 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 the absence of sun the maserati 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 and the speed that is born on average 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.189
 to conclude and if you wanted to send me your suggestions 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.819
 you can click on the icon at the bottom right to open your 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.899
 messaging software 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.019
 I thank you for listening and good navigation
