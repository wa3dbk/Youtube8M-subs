00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.690
 abnormal heat and smoke forced mintrans 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.889
 tighten the requirements for 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.500
 airlines to work in difficult 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.089
 weather conditions Minister of Transport 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.220
 Igor Levitin stated that now everything 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 aircraft will need to have 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.349
 navigation equipment 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.559
 allowing you to fly even 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 at zero visibility besides the minister 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.009
 qualifying pilots 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.050
 some airlines due 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.339
 This many flights had to enter with 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.679
 Moscow to alternate airfields on the other 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.960
 the country is gaining momentum scandal 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 inflamed after the pilots 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.639
 service instructors 

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.840
 the staff of the largest companies in the open 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 called the state of the Russian 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 civil aviation close to full 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.600
 collapse of the security situation 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.630
 air traffic and therefore quality 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.420
 aircraft on which we are offered 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.899
 think 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.210
 understood Oleg Kokhan 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.240
 Elena Smirnova always dreamed a lot 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.010
 travels but after this summer 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 Visited Bulgaria Girl simply fears 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.130
 to fly 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.890
 The fact is that back to Moscow I had to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.670
 coming back on a very old plane 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.590
 imported which 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.410
 belonged to a russian company 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.950
 according to Lena, the liner was ready to fall apart 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.080
 in the air was shaking a lot during 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.830
 flight 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.610
 and also turned off the lights several times 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 so further when we 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.920
 Moscow interfered with the aircraft several times 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 circle 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.750
 everyone was scared of my life I think 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.030
 not a timid girlfriend 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.290
 but next year decided no longer fly and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.720
 won't choose Russian 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.409
 carrier of such stories more and more for 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.130
 few minutes on the internet you can 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.720
 find here as well 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.090
 the question is why are people 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.990
 posting your emotions on the internet is not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 complain 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.530
 for example the prosecutor's offices themselves airlines 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.200
 the answer is obvious 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630
 because in airlines they are not 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.280
 hear 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.189
 is amazing 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.100
 can not only ordinary passengers 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 and hear even 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 pilots sitting at the helm of these 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 airplanes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020
 many have such an attitude 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.600
 microsoft but the manual no longer stand and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.090
 do it yourself to the journalists 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.190
 Hero of Russia Test Pilot Anatoly 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.920
 Knyshov mastered fifty different 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.030
 aircraft from what technique today 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 about a colleague take the air come in 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.500
 horror if 10 years old plane 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.060
 operated abroad right 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.530
 prohibits exploit 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 in the Americas so why 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.000
 we give court according to Konyshev 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.110
 many imported aircraft sometimes fly 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.370
 twenty so-called failures 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.750
 easier to say with breakdowns all because 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.730
 what is simple leased liners 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.009
 threatens the carrier with millions of losses 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.799
 photo raise commander machine 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.799
 air risking life property 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.369
 who is smarter so far only flies 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.579
 she flies unprepared 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.769
 people in the early nineties country 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.349
 there were 35 thousand pilots now and 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.389
 fifteen 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.259
 500 600 people retire every year 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.539
 only one Kuryanovskaya prepare the shift 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.539
 college all graduation there eighty raw 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.969
 not knowing how to fly boys from 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.219
 for the shortage of flight personnel, many pilots 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.029
 forced to recycle 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.949
 more air laid 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.539
 every fourth liner commander 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.979
 what kind of security is there 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.979
 the state left without preparation 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.489
 civil aviation market did not come there 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.140
 but what especially scares 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780
 so is the indifference of some of ours 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.769
 fellow citizens 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.909
 those who have not yet encountered, and even those 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.109
 who faced problems in the attack 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.149
 don't want to fight for their rights and 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.149
 continue to fly with a claim to life 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.539
 I don't think anyone is afraid 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.669
 so abroad the fact that he is an old plane 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.479
 must know 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.099
 yes old planes really are and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.979
 abroad 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.069
 in africa in india in the poorest countries 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.979
 America is where it happens more 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.159
 total disasters 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.930
 now in this series firmly established and 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.359
 Russia
