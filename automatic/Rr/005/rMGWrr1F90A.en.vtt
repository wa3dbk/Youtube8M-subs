way here you should be careful though

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
way here you should be careful though
this<00:01:55.770> area<00:01:55.950> has<00:01:56.219> many<00:01:56.399> unsolved<00:01:56.909> mysteries

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
this area has many unsolved mysteries

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.300 
this area has many unsolved mysteries
about<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:58.020> example<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.560> found<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
about it for example I found out that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
about it for example I found out that
everything<00:01:59.610> seems<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.240> slowed<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.680> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
everything seems to be slowed down it is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
everything seems to be slowed down it is
really<00:02:02.070> quite<00:02:02.280> odd<00:02:02.460> almost<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.119> visit<00:02:03.509> almost

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
really quite odd almost a visit almost

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.069 
really quite odd almost a visit almost
as<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.560> itself<00:02:04.950> has<00:02:05.159> crawled<00:02:05.840> has<00:02:06.840> been

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
as if time itself has crawled has been

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.190 
as if time itself has crawled has been
crawling<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.649> crawling<00:02:08.220> along<00:02:08.310> slower<00:02:09.200> but

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
crawling is crawling along slower but

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.650 
crawling is crawling along slower but
that<00:02:10.410> can't<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.739> possible<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.280> no<00:02:12.060> magic

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that can't be possible right no magic

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.700 
that can't be possible right no magic
isn't<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.020> strong

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
isn't that strong

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.520 
isn't that strong
sorry<00:02:14.610> look<00:02:15.300> I've<00:02:15.510> gone<00:02:15.660> off<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.410> my

them they need to be purified and clean
okay<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.940> let's<00:02:24.570> go<00:02:24.720> ahead<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.020> run<00:02:25.460> straight

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
okay so let's go ahead and run straight

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.090 
okay so let's go ahead and run straight
out<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:28.580> believe<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:31.320> over

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
out this way I believe it is right over

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
out this way I believe it is right over
here<00:02:33.500> yeah<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.070> over<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.340> way<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
here yeah I think it's over this way you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.810 
here yeah I think it's over this way you
said<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.960> cave<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.130> mountain<00:02:42.410> so

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
said it in a cave in the mountain so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.460 
said it in a cave in the mountain so
well<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.940> looks<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.450> could<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.660> well<00:02:46.200> no

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
well that looks like it could be well no

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.900 
well that looks like it could be well no
that<00:02:46.710> doesn't<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.310> looks<00:02:47.490> like<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.760> could

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that doesn't that it looks like it could

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.060 
that doesn't that it looks like it could
be<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:49.490> trail<00:02:50.490> leading<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> though<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
be a trail leading to it though is it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.890 
be a trail leading to it though is it
let's<00:02:53.820> see<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:56.510> don't<00:02:57.510> know

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
let's see I don't know

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:08.360 
let's see I don't know
it's<00:02:58.290> possibility<00:02:59.090> not<00:03:00.090> too<00:03:00.360> sure

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.770 

now<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.450> doesn't<00:03:09.780> look<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.780> let's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
now this doesn't look like it so let's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.860 
now this doesn't look like it so let's
just<00:03:13.050> keep<00:03:13.379> on<00:03:14.030> running<00:03:15.030> alongside<00:03:15.480> this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
just keep on running alongside this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.540 
just keep on running alongside this
mountain<00:03:16.319> though<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.680> thinking<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
mountain though I'm thinking this is the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.070 
mountain though I'm thinking this is the
mountain<00:03:17.879> that<00:03:17.940> he<00:03:18.180> was<00:03:18.300> talking<00:03:18.629> about<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
mountain that he was talking about I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.020 
mountain that he was talking about I
mean<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.800> just<00:03:19.950> seems<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.550> has<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.849> be<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
mean it just seems like it has to be a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.320 
mean it just seems like it has to be a
ceiling<00:03:21.780> mountain<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.319> area<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:23.180> let's<00:03:24.180> go

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
ceiling mountain in the area so let's go

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.740 
ceiling mountain in the area so let's go
ahead<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.540> run<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:27.180> way<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:29.420> see<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.599> can

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
ahead and run this way and see if we can

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.619 
ahead and run this way and see if we can
come<00:03:30.900> across<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.700> along<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.910> mountain<00:03:33.239> face

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
come across it along this mountain face

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.800 
come across it along this mountain face
here<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:37.290> see<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.590> yet<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:38.540> looks<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.750> a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
here we see it yet that looks like a

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.289 
here we see it yet that looks like a
good<00:03:40.049> sign<00:03:40.319> you<00:03:40.650> said<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.610> was<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:41.910> overall

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
good sign you said it was really overall

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.199 
good sign you said it was really overall
this<00:03:42.630> has<00:03:42.840> got<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.319> it

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
this has got to be it

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.150 
this has got to be it
okay<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:45.269> let's<00:03:45.599> see<00:03:45.750> if<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.769> find<00:03:46.890> any<00:03:47.099> of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
okay so let's see if we can find any of

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.229 
okay so let's see if we can find any of
those<00:03:47.250> flowers<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.880> here

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
right mmm that looks like a good sign in

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.150 
right mmm that looks like a good sign in
