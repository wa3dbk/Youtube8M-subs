00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
half way across the map and it's easily

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.530 
half way across the map and it's easily
one<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> best<00:02:11.520> assault<00:02:11.940> rifles<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.420> the

one of the best assault rifles in the
game

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
game

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
game
actually<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.410> could<00:02:13.590> say<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
actually I could say it's one of the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.040 
actually I could say it's one of the
best<00:02:14.220> guns<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.210> what<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.570> run<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.930> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
best guns so what I like to run on this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.570 
best guns so what I like to run on this
weapon<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.070> DNA<00:02:17.370> bombs

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
weapon if I'm going for DNA bombs

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
weapon if I'm going for DNA bombs
obviously<00:02:18.360> I'm<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.690> running<00:02:18.870> UAV

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
obviously I'm going to be running UAV

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.290 
obviously I'm going to be running UAV
and<00:02:19.320> system<00:02:19.740> act<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.820> means<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.240> be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and system act and that means I can be

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.610 
and system act and that means I can be
running<00:02:21.570> primary<00:02:21.960> gunfighter<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.500> this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
running primary gunfighter on this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.830 
running primary gunfighter on this
weapon<00:02:22.800> which<00:02:23.100> would<00:02:23.250> probably<00:02:23.400> mean<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.090> stock

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
weapon which would probably mean a stock

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.140 
weapon which would probably mean a stock
as<00:02:25.080> usual<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.740> run<00:02:25.890> stock<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.280> every<00:02:26.490> AR<00:02:26.820> like<00:02:27.030> i

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
as usual I run stock on every AR like i

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.730 
as usual I run stock on every AR like i
said<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.140> i'm<00:02:28.320> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.560> running

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
said but i'm going to be running

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.550 
said but i'm going to be running
silencer<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.310> extended<00:02:29.850> mags<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.210> well

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
silencer and extended mags as well

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.600 
silencer and extended mags as well
silence<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.650> obviously<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.160> keep<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.400> off<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
silence are obviously to keep me off the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.860 
silence are obviously to keep me off the
mini-map<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.120> i<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.300> try<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> stay<00:02:33.780> alive

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
mini-map so i can try to stay alive

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840 
mini-map so i can try to stay alive
longer<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.280> guys<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.790> this

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
longer but as you guys can see in this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.520 
longer but as you guys can see in this
gameplay<00:02:36.090> i<00:02:36.270> was<00:02:36.450> running<00:02:36.570> assault<00:02:37.200> shrieks

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
gameplay i was running assault shrieks

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.610 
gameplay i was running assault shrieks
and<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:39.060> i'm<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:39.990> for<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.470> an

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
and if i'm going to be going for like an

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.650 
and if i'm going to be going for like an
assault<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.310> high<00:02:41.610> kill<00:02:41.880> gameplay<00:02:42.120> i'm

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
assault or a high kill gameplay i'm

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540 
assault or a high kill gameplay i'm
probably<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.530> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> run<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> silencer

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
probably not going to run a silencer

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.890 
probably not going to run a silencer
just<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:44.910> i<00:02:44.970> don't<00:02:45.000> have<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.300> run<00:02:45.510> primary

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
just so i don't have to run primary

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.060 
just so i don't have to run primary
gunfighter<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.710> run<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
gunfighter just so I can run the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.980 
gunfighter just so I can run the
streaker<00:02:47.520> options<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.330> run<00:02:48.570> forward<00:02:48.870> kill

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
streaker options I can run forward kill

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.900 
streaker options I can run forward kill
streaks<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.740> in<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.160> case<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.670> probably

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
streaks so in that case I'm probably

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.580 
streaks so in that case I'm probably
just<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.480> run<00:02:51.660> stock<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.170> extended

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
just going to run stock and extended

should have ran stock extended mags but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.170 
should have ran stock extended mags but
it<00:02:58.890> all<00:02:58.980> depends<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.370> map<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.850> your<00:03:00.000> play

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it all depends on the map and your play

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.430 
it all depends on the map and your play
style<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.720> guys<00:03:00.840> got<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.200> make<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
style and you guys got to make the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.890 
style and you guys got to make the
decision<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.240> works<00:03:03.390> best<00:03:03.660> for

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
decision on you know what works best for

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.120 
decision on you know what works best for
you<00:03:04.020> because<00:03:04.290> some<00:03:04.410> people<00:03:04.650> prefer<00:03:04.770> like

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you because some people prefer like

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.470 
you because some people prefer like
things<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.550> quick-draw<00:03:05.970> grip<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.360> stuff

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
things like a quick-draw grip and stuff

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.060 
things like a quick-draw grip and stuff
like<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.990> feel<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.320> it's<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.560> necessary

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
like that I feel like it's not necessary

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.980 
like that I feel like it's not necessary
but<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.270> like<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.600> said<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.900> all

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
but you know like I said it's all

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.720 
but you know like I said it's all
personal<00:03:10.200> preference<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:10.920> when<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.640> are

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
personal preference but when you are

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.310 
personal preference but when you are
using<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.120> weapon<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.840> want<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.110> play<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
using this weapon you do want to play a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.470 
using this weapon you do want to play a
little<00:03:13.530> bit<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:13.950> passive<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.940> mean<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.270> can

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
little bit more passive I mean you can

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.850 
little bit more passive I mean you can
rush<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.140> weapon<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.680> is

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
rush with this weapon because it is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.070 
rush with this weapon because it is
about<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.300> same<00:03:18.510> time<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.959> don't

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
about but at the same time you don't
