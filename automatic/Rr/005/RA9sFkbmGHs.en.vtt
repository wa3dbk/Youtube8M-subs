00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that you'd be number one overall pick

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.230 
that you'd be number one overall pick
and<00:00:53.220> how<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:53.970> all<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.560> had<00:00:55.740> a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
and how did that all go I think I had a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.420 
and how did that all go I think I had a
good<00:00:57.240> relationship<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:58.160> their<00:00:59.160> general

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
good relationship with their general

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000 
good relationship with their general
manager<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.020> got<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.140> opportunity<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.620> be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
manager and got an opportunity to be

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
manager and got an opportunity to be
looked<00:01:02.220> at<00:01:02.370> their<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:03.199> potentially<00:01:04.199> their

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
looked at their it potentially their

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
looked at their it potentially their
draft<00:01:05.370> pick<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.730> obviously<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> didn't<00:01:06.690> go

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
draft pick and obviously it didn't go

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
draft pick and obviously it didn't go
that<00:01:06.870> way<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:07.980> happy

about<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.540> coming<00:01:10.230> from<00:01:10.350> Texas

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
about that but for me coming from Texas

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
about that but for me coming from Texas
having<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.070> Texas<00:01:11.430> roots<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
having those Texas roots and one of the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
having those Texas roots and one of the
two<00:01:12.270> teams<00:01:12.480> that<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.780> Texas<00:01:13.110> having<00:01:13.440> that

two teams that are in Texas having that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
two teams that are in Texas having that
possibility<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.640> potentially<00:01:15.630> may<00:01:15.720> be

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
possibility of potentially may be

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
possibility of potentially may be
needing<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> quarterback<00:01:16.560> having<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> first

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
needing a quarterback having the first

pick<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:17.760> draft<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.240> obviously

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
pick in the draft it was obviously

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.719 
pick in the draft it was obviously
something<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.980> intriguing<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> me<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
something that was intriguing to me and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
something that was intriguing to me and
stuck<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.410> time<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
stuck out to me and at the same time I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.680 
stuck out to me and at the same time I
never<00:01:22.890> had<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.190> heart<00:01:23.490> set<00:01:23.760> on<00:01:23.820> any<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.360> team

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
never had my heart set on any one team

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.910 
never had my heart set on any one team
or<00:01:26.600> really<00:01:27.600> felt<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> wanted<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.830> go
