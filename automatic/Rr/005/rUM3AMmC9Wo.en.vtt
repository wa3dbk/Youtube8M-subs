right<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> stability<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> reload

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
right here the stability and the reload

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.030 
right here the stability and the reload
then<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.540> hip<00:01:46.079> fire<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> Spokane<00:01:46.860> has

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
then we have a hip fire the Spokane has

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
then we have a hip fire the Spokane has
bought<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> second<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:47.909> fired<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bought a second see when fired from the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
bought a second see when fired from the
hip<00:01:48.560> increase<00:01:49.560> attack<00:01:49.890> power<00:01:50.159> allows<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
hip increase attack power allows you to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
hip increase attack power allows you to
open<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.329> cosmic<00:01:51.689> damage<00:01:51.930> basically<00:01:52.320> damage

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
open a cosmic damage basically damage

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
open a cosmic damage basically damage
this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> coolest<00:01:53.579> things<00:01:53.939> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
this is one of the coolest things that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
this is one of the coolest things that
it<00:01:54.210> has<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.630> has<00:01:54.899> explosive<00:01:55.619> rounds<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it has it has explosive rounds so it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.780 
it has it has explosive rounds so it
makes<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> very<00:01:56.579> very<00:01:56.820> well<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.579> an

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
makes it very very well one you have an

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.609 
makes it very very well one you have an
impact<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> potential<00:02:00.840> weapon<00:02:01.259> area<00:02:01.469> so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
impact of the potential weapon area so

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
impact of the potential weapon area so
it<00:02:01.710> does<00:02:01.890> give<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.340> explosive<00:02:02.880> round

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it does give you that explosive round

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330 
it does give you that explosive round
very<00:02:03.659> very<00:02:03.899> cool<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> very<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:05.100> has

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
very very cool and very well also has

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.950 
very very cool and very well also has
quick<00:02:05.670> draw<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.420> where<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> drawn

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
quick draw this is where I can be drawn

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600 
quick draw this is where I can be drawn
unbelievably<00:02:07.409> fast<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.310> much<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
unbelievably fast not really too much of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
unbelievably fast not really too much of
a<00:02:08.670> perk<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.869> reckoned<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
a perk to be you know reckoned with you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.900 
a perk to be you know reckoned with you
might<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.129> go<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> explosive

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
might as well go with the explosive

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.790 
might as well go with the explosive
rounds<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.480> you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
rounds and then you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.990 
rounds and then you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.140 
an over line of what you're supposed to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
have and then we have the last but a lot

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.630 
have and then we have the last but a lot
not<00:04:11.660> least<00:04:11.959> one<00:04:12.200> down<00:04:12.410> on<00:04:12.709> this<00:04:12.860> one<00:04:13.100> we're

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
not least one down on this one we're

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.580 
not least one down on this one we're
going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.850> lose<00:04:14.030> stability<00:04:14.450> but<00:04:15.320> we're<00:04:15.500> going

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
going to lose stability but we're going

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.170 
going to lose stability but we're going
to<00:04:15.680> increase<00:04:15.980> our<00:04:16.220> reloaded<00:04:16.730> will<00:04:16.850> see<00:04:17.030> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
to increase our reloaded will see the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.550 
to increase our reloaded will see the
increase<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.600> lethal<00:04:17.959> but<00:04:18.080> we<00:04:18.169> don't<00:04:18.350> see<00:04:18.440> that

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
increase of lethal but we don't see that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.310 
increase of lethal but we don't see that
much<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.549> difference<00:04:19.580> here<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.419> let's<00:04:21.140> go

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
much of a difference here so let's go

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.810 
much of a difference here so let's go
ahead<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.530> reload<00:04:21.830> this<00:04:22.160> one<00:04:22.340> supposedly

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
ahead and reload this one supposedly

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.310 
ahead and reload this one supposedly
this<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.150> going<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> increase<00:04:23.570> her<00:04:23.780> reload<00:04:24.140> and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
this is going to increase her reload and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.870 
this is going to increase her reload and
we'll<00:04:25.130> count<00:04:25.400> down

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
we'll count down

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.940 
we'll count down
we<00:04:26.000> go<00:04:26.120> here<00:04:26.270> we<00:04:26.330> go<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:27.470> two<00:04:28.310> three<00:04:29.300> four<00:04:30.170> all

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
we go here we go one two three four all

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.260 
we go here we go one two three four all
right<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.220> basically<00:04:31.340> like<00:04:31.730> about<00:04:31.970> four

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
right so basically like about four

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.090 
right so basically like about four
seconds<00:04:32.780> let's<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:33.470> ahead<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.860> switch<00:04:34.070> it

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
seconds let's go ahead and switch it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.510 
seconds let's go ahead and switch it
over<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:35.830> tradition<00:04:36.830> right<00:04:36.950> here<00:04:37.190> where

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
over to the tradition right here where

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.280 
over to the tradition right here where
we'll<00:04:37.850> probably<00:04:38.480> a<00:04:38.600> let's<00:04:38.810> switch<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:38.990> over<00:04:39.140> to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
we'll probably a let's switch it over to

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.960 
we'll probably a let's switch it over to
this<00:04:39.380> one<00:04:39.560> will<00:04:39.770> drop<00:04:40.160> our<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.490> love<00:04:40.670> quite

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
this one will drop our we love quite

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.010 
this one will drop our we love quite
often<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.300> let's<00:04:42.110> go<00:04:42.460> then<00:04:43.460> here<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:43.670> go<00:04:44.020> one

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
often so let's go then here we go one

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.940 
often so let's go then here we go one
two<00:04:46.000> three<00:04:47.000> four<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.200> pretty<00:04:48.380> much<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.740> same

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950
