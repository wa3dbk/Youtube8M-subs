00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
they establish that the reason why the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.220 
they establish that the reason why the
chainsaw<00:05:10.370> bayonet<00:05:10.520> was<00:05:10.850> even<00:05:11.270> even<00:05:11.960> thought

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
chainsaw bayonet was even even thought

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.260 
chainsaw bayonet was even even thought
of<00:05:12.410> was<00:05:12.590> because<00:05:12.920> there's<00:05:13.040> a<00:05:13.130> part<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.640> said

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
of was because there's a part I said

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.490 
of was because there's a part I said
this<00:05:14.390> earlier<00:05:14.510> in<00:05:14.780> another<00:05:14.990> video<00:05:15.230> but<00:05:15.380> I'll

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
this earlier in another video but I'll

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.140 
this earlier in another video but I'll
just<00:05:15.680> reestablished<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.370> again<00:05:16.550> there's<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
just reestablished it again there's a

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.020 
just reestablished it again there's a
part<00:05:17.450> where<00:05:17.510> him<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.050> Marcus<00:05:18.380> are<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:19.160> store

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
part where him and Marcus are in a store

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.210 
part where him and Marcus are in a store
like<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.480> normal<00:05:20.960> department<00:05:21.410> store<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.860> they

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
like a normal department store and they

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.920 
like a normal department store and they
get<00:05:22.400> attacked<00:05:22.670> by<00:05:22.910> locusts<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.510> Marcus<00:05:23.810> is

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
get attacked by locusts and Marcus is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.790 
get attacked by locusts and Marcus is
kind<00:05:24.170> of<00:05:24.260> in<00:05:24.380> trouble

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
kind of in trouble

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.920 
kind of in trouble
so<00:05:25.310> what<00:05:25.490> taya<00:05:25.670> does<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.240> he<00:05:26.390> finds<00:05:26.600> like<00:05:26.780> this

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
so what taya does is he finds like this

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.240 
so what taya does is he finds like this
random<00:05:27.110> bustle<00:05:27.650> that's<00:05:27.830> sitting<00:05:28.070> on<00:05:28.130> the

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
random bustle that's sitting on the

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.010 
random bustle that's sitting on the
shelf<00:05:28.490> in<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.670> store<00:05:28.970> turns<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.750> shit<00:05:29.990> on

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
shelf in the store turns that shit on

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.050 
shelf in the store turns that shit on
and<00:05:30.350> completely<00:05:30.740> change<00:05:30.980> all<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.280> locusts<00:05:31.940> in

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
and completely change all the locusts in

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.720 
and completely change all the locusts in
half<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.990> he<00:05:33.230> got<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.800> idea<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.490> chainsaw

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
half so he got that idea of the chainsaw

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.000 
half so he got that idea of the chainsaw
from<00:05:35.270> doing<00:05:35.720> that<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.260> then<00:05:36.470> they<00:05:36.620> gave<00:05:36.830> that

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
from doing that and then they gave that

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.820 
from doing that and then they gave that
idea<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.520> Adam<00:05:37.940> Fenix<00:05:38.150> which<00:05:38.570> later<00:05:38.900> added<00:05:39.740> on

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
idea to Adam Fenix which later added on

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.980 
idea to Adam Fenix which later added on
to<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.130> Lancer<00:05:40.580> so<00:05:41.150> he<00:05:41.390> was<00:05:41.540> actually<00:05:41.900> the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
to the Lancer so he was actually the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.900 
to the Lancer so he was actually the
reason<00:05:42.140> why<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.470> chainsaw<00:05:43.070> bayonet<00:05:43.250> was<00:05:43.580> even

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
reason why the chainsaw bayonet was even

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.730 
reason why the chainsaw bayonet was even
created<00:05:44.360> because<00:05:44.660> he<00:05:44.900> got<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.230> idea<00:05:45.350> hey

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
created because he got that idea hey

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.920 
created because he got that idea hey
let's<00:05:46.100> use<00:05:46.310> like<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.550> bustle<00:05:47.090> that<00:05:47.270> chainsaw

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
let's use like a bustle that chainsaw

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.409 
let's use like a bustle that chainsaw
this<00:05:48.080> locust<00:05:48.410> in<00:05:48.530> half<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.919> let's<00:05:49.760> you<00:05:50.300> know

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
this locust in half and let's you know

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.270 
this locust in half and let's you know
Marcus<00:05:50.810> saw<00:05:51.260> it<00:05:51.320> as<00:05:51.470> a<00:05:51.530> great<00:05:51.680> idea<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.190> he

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
Marcus saw it as a great idea and he

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.800 
Marcus saw it as a great idea and he
gave<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.700> idea<00:05:52.820> to<00:05:53.090> Adam<00:05:53.300> Phoenix<00:05:53.630> and

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
gave the idea to Adam Phoenix and

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.750 
gave the idea to Adam Phoenix and
decided<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.680> add<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:54.980> on<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.280> their<00:05:55.430> weaponry

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
decided to add it on to their weaponry

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.820 
decided to add it on to their weaponry
so<00:05:56.210> he's<00:05:56.480> actually<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:56.900> main<00:05:57.290> reason<00:05:57.320> why<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
so he's actually the main reason why the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.770 
so he's actually the main reason why the
chainsaw<00:05:58.400> was<00:05:58.520> even<00:05:58.790> existed<00:05:59.240> in<00:05:59.360> their<00:05:59.480> world

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
chainsaw was even existed in their world

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.380 
chainsaw was even existed in their world
the<00:06:00.320> chainsaw<00:06:00.680> bayonet<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:01.100> mean<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.550> then

the chainsaw bayonet I mean and then

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.880 
the chainsaw bayonet I mean and then
eventually<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:02.960> know<00:06:03.169> we<00:06:03.320> saw<00:06:03.470> what<00:06:03.620> happened

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
eventually you know we saw what happened

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.560
