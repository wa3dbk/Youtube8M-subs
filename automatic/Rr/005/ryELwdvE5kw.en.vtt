00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
now I like the figure it's a really nice
figure<00:00:12.809> really<00:00:13.170> sleek<00:00:13.910> but<00:00:15.350> his<00:00:16.350> dinosaur

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
figure really sleek but his dinosaur

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.859 
figure really sleek but his dinosaur
mode<00:00:17.670> he<00:00:17.910> doesn't<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.449> pull<00:00:18.690> off<00:00:18.840> that

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
mode he doesn't really pull off that

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.599 
mode he doesn't really pull off that
well<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:21.769> if<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.980> stand<00:00:23.279> him<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:25.609> he

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.620 
well because if you stand him up he
looks<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> prehistoric<00:00:27.439> turtle<00:00:29.630> even

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
looks like a prehistoric turtle even

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
looks like a prehistoric turtle even
though<00:00:30.720> he's<00:00:30.840> got<00:00:30.960> no<00:00:31.170> thing<00:00:31.650> underneath<00:00:32.040> his

though he's got no thing underneath his
thing<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:34.309> yeah<00:00:37.010> he's<00:00:38.010> okay<00:00:38.370> he<00:00:38.910> he<00:00:39.239> does<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
thing but yeah he's okay he he does have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
thing but yeah he's okay he he does have
a<00:00:40.520> good<00:00:41.520> amount<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.969> articulation<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
a good amount of articulation in this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
a good amount of articulation in this
mode<00:00:48.320> really<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.800> robot<00:00:50.250> mode

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
mode really it's more like robot mode

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.170 
mode really it's more like robot mode
and<00:00:50.789> they've<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.410> stuck<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:53.180> dinosaur

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and they've just stuck a dinosaur

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.410 
and they've just stuck a dinosaur
prehistoric<00:00:54.960> dinosaur<00:00:55.559> head<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.579> face

prehistoric dinosaur head on the face
itself<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:59.449> made<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> arms<00:01:00.960> attach<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
itself and just made the arms attach the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.060 
itself and just made the arms attach the
wings<00:01:05.990> his<00:01:06.990> dinosaur<00:01:07.470> mode<00:01:07.619> could<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.920> better

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
wings his dinosaur mode could be better

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.179 
wings his dinosaur mode could be better
but<00:01:09.260> robot<00:01:10.260> mode<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.439> definitely<00:01:10.920> definitely

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
but robot mode is definitely definitely

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.480 
but robot mode is definitely definitely

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
swoops feet and you just get this little

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
swoops feet and you just get this little
bit<00:01:52.560> dangling<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.280> end<00:01:55.250> if<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.430> was<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
bit dangling on the end if there was a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.719 
bit dangling on the end if there was a
hole<00:01:56.850> where<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.590> could<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.710> pegged<00:01:59.310> onto<00:01:59.610> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
hole where I could have pegged onto this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.870 
hole where I could have pegged onto this
it<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.090> been<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> lot<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.570> better

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it would have been a lot more better

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.590 
it would have been a lot more better
because<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.540> little

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
because then you just get this little

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
because then you just get this little
dangly<00:02:04.200> piece<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.390> yeah<00:02:07.610> let's<00:02:08.610> move<00:02:08.819> there

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
dangly piece but yeah let's move there

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.710 
dangly piece but yeah let's move there
and<00:02:09.179> away

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
and away

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.950 
and away
let's<00:02:11.720> get<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.170> robot<00:02:12.560> mode<00:02:13.240> now<00:02:14.240> all<00:02:14.780> you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
let's get on to robot mode now all you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.990 
let's get on to robot mode now all you
have<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.620> rotate<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.580> feet<00:02:16.700> around

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.070 

detach<00:02:23.000> these<00:02:23.600> pieces<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.900> move<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
detach these pieces like that move the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.010 
detach these pieces like that move the
wings<00:02:27.260> back<00:02:31.840> separate<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.290> from<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.190> area

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
wings back separate that from this area

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.060 
wings back separate that from this area
if<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:39.160> move<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.400> head<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.790> like<00:02:41.000> that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
if I can move the head up like that

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.390 
if I can move the head up like that
split<00:02:43.070> these<00:02:43.220> pieces<00:02:43.580> apart<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.960> that<00:02:45.400> fold

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
split these pieces apart like that fold

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:55.090 
split these pieces apart like that fold
this<00:02:46.580> piece<00:02:46.820> here<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:53.950> connect<00:02:54.950> those

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
this piece here like that connect those

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.990 
this piece here like that connect those
pieces<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.610> that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
pieces like that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.650 
pieces like that
and<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:56.300> holding<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:58.550> tab<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
and then holding this just tab on the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.020 
and then holding this just tab on the
wings<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> back<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.310> will<00:03:01.520> hold<00:03:01.730> all

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
wings to the back and that will hold all

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.720 
wings to the back and that will hold all
those<00:03:02.240> pieces<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.930> place<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.680> don't<00:03:04.400> forget

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
those pieces in place and don't forget

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.630 
those pieces in place and don't forget
to<00:03:05.650> twist<00:03:06.650> round<00:03:07.340> waist<00:03:09.070> now<00:03:10.070> he<00:03:10.130> may<00:03:10.370> look

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to twist round waist now he may look

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
to twist round waist now he may look
