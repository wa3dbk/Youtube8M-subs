00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
another swing you might be good at just

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
another swing you might be good at just
like<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.790> swings<00:00:36.210> here's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> few<00:00:37.260> other

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like the two swings here's a few other

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.830 
like the two swings here's a few other
examples<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> swing<00:00:38.399> here's<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.629> goes

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
examples of swing here's one that goes

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.970 
examples of swing here's one that goes
like<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.469> swing

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
like this and this one is one swing

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
like this and this one is one swing
because<00:00:44.550> generally<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> Roper<00:00:46.440> kind

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
because generally I think the Roper kind

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
because generally I think the Roper kind
of<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.160> pretty<00:00:47.489> close<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> animal

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
of has to be pretty close to the animal

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
of has to be pretty close to the animal
in<00:00:48.780> order<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> make<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.469> swing<00:00:49.950> work<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.520> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
in order to make one swing work so then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.600 
in order to make one swing work so then
you<00:00:51.270> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> pull<00:00:52.260> back<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.620> slack<00:00:52.920> then

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you kind of pull back your slack then

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
you kind of pull back your slack then
you<00:00:53.730> jerk<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> air<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you jerk it up in the air like that the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
you jerk it up in the air like that the
hope<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> loop<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> tight<00:00:56.399> around

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
hope the loop is going to tight around

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
hope the loop is going to tight around
the<00:00:56.699> neck<00:00:57.109> then<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.649> you've<00:00:58.829> seen<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the neck then so you've seen one out of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.209 
the neck then so you've seen one out of
two<00:00:59.730> swings<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.469> swing<00:01:01.859> then

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
two swings so you see one swing then

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
two swings so you see one swing then
you've<00:01:02.370> seen<00:01:02.550> two<00:01:02.789> swings<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.690> here's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you've seen two swings and here's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.190 
you've seen two swings and here's
another<00:01:03.989> example<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.339> done

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
another example of how it's really done

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.539
