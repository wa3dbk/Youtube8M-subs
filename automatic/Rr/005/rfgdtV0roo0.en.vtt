right here that is a single-speed Costa
brain<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.720> bring<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> bikes<00:01:28.289> to<00:01:28.560> let

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
brain as we bring the bikes to let

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.070

everybody ride them in fact there are

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.050 
everybody ride them in fact there are
all<00:01:31.320> single<00:01:31.560> speeds<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.190> spaces<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
all single speeds make spaces that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
all single speeds make spaces that
everyone's<00:01:33.509> having<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> level<00:01:35.220> plane
