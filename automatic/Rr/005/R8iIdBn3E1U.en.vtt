00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.170
 where does the journey for the DAX go by the end of the year? 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.510
 Many investors can consult one of the mental data or even the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.330
 Chartanalyse but today want the leading index times in relation to the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.510
 For astrology I speak now with the pale astrologer Henning 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.390
 Shepherd by Cosmo Trend 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 Mr. Schäfer at our last meeting they said that on the DAX in the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.759
 Autumn turbulent times are coming to see them still today so yes me 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:28.269
 have Opel 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.189
 ever 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 Affected will stand for consolidation in the fall of this can clarify 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.270
 and I think that we are still in critical character heads on the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.460
 Banner probably 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 about the word Offenburg and Mannheim often drives the agony 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
 They named as important date the twentieth of September after it for 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.500
 the lead index should go down to 15 percent a week later 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.720
 the DAX was just below the mark of 6300 points 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.910
 where is the journey now in the coming weeks 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.679
 and he got interrogators like he did on a plan 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.839
 in% September a high at 6340 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.690
 Like fabric bags, the DAX is below this mark at 6,000 square meters 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.750
 In other words, we will certainly still find ourselves in conflict resolution 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.630
 Karl Rauber was 5100 30 points stronger than expected 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.570
 I would say that one should nevertheless continue the petty one there already 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 have mentioned 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 I still think of the straight way from Prague I became here 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 Investigators are holding 5 5 percent of this I am 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.000
 I would wish that in Oberberg company minimum wage the 5600 5800 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.800
 Points should stand 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.650
 that is even better for Varela Bertha von Gaudí then just one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.070
 vigorous rally start Ethan area 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.850
 many buy in the scoring of the knee-op 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.070
 Republic a year on 2 2 2 2 1 I wanted to compare the Fiat when I'm in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580
 October to form a Thibaut 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.970
 here, of course, always with no distinctive deep and therefore I am 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.960
 and I still wanted "Who wants progress 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.130
 the mark of 5400 points they have just addressed is already very 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 Low from today's perspective No would be the possible 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.690
 So then I'll be calculating in the corners percent 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.619
 four weeks past four five weeks 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.439
 Wendelstein no job consolidations 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.459
 Yes, that's what happened I was there I try no tailwind 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.309
 the account assignment outlasted my rounds faster on top again 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.629
 but as I said 5,000 Becquerel 5008 would have me for a long time but already 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.469
 satisfied with and then meant and then rises 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.889
 What do you think with the DAX then stand by the end of the year 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.249
 At the end of the year 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.499
 King we introduce the same day of data company election the account assignment Alb 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.589
 going 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:44.039
 but I am neither comparing year in the same day when running away 410 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.069
 What do you advise investors about the leading index? 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.220
 and for the moment honest who would WADA because important brand 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.839
 Bogner will because because of course he would have strong 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.540
 resistance 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.009
 already in the range of 6300 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.099
 5 FakeFactory 400 since we already have three here will help toppers trained 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.659
 officially managed to rise above it should break the mark upwards 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.759
 will definitely jump on the program when it comes to consumption 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.469
 then many will be at 6400 6800 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.939
 so stuck again the platform moment will not be annoyed 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.079
 will definitely continue Bogota 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.379
 if the DAX was able to do the final runs chunks for animals 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.530
 then you should be alone in the range of 5600 5800 of Werder daughters 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.230
 pay attention to technical purchase signals and then you can get in the medium term 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.219
 Let's talk to Goldsmith for the price of the precious metal 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.309
 For about two months exclusively abroad, how do they rate the price of gold? 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.339
 from an astrological point of view 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.029
 so smelt for gold percent or even ITK squad for the last quarter 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.449
 agree with her negatively 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.210
 I think for yesterday percent double error in gold 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.719
 so we will die 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.599
 in the high a topic found reached 1000 264 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.279
 Hornbach but very weakly closed at 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.239
 Percent 300 Alba Afterburner watched 30 points 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.489
 and of course he's the director who came out yesterday and has the cultural council 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.699
 On the eighth 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.789
 Friedland whether so indicated 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.900
 a crime scene is not easy anymore 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.150
 very well 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.780
 I think of the wallpaper comments we pass aging 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.580
 and Stenger happy end of September maybe in January February Courier of 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.300
 the surfaces will not stand a thousand and a half 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.219
 but with higher courses 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.349
 that means the malaise is just finished with the gold 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.889
 Third my forecast but I would also be a few percent episode 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.800
 can be proposed 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.330
 over and drive 64 but wanted to get off 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.490
 then you just wanted to consider whether dry head and Thurgau 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.140
 speak 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.490
 but I actually think that over 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.150
 What does the cosmos now say pay for the future of the gold price? 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.099
 Now right down or Buster go up again 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.389
 All buyer Stadler of gold I have him Alcohol ban Danger of gold 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.159
 Prettier 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.259
 the dough finds all the files finds programs field find where I am there 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.599
 Cargill would still give grades to build through weekly 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.020
 In week attention the bonus for end-of-life cars is affirmed 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.939
 and there is my Rollo with beginning of September 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.110
 maybe we can miss good double top at the Golf 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.969
 and then the guy with the sharp downturn sets that passwords 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.229
 You can not expect it either 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.090
 Henning Schäfer from Cosmo Trends best thanks for the interview
