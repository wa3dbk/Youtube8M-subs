00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.420
 12,000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer every year in our country 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.420
 45 rounds of those deaths are unnecessary, according to lockhorn doctors in hoogezand 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.769
 if you are up on time then it is one of the best 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.480
 why build and cure a cancer 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.780
 as a precaution, every patient over the age of 45 receives a free pass 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.980
 colon cancer test offered 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 Patients can soon pick up the tests and perform at home Christ wants 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.869
 I did not expect and with a limitation the French self-test 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 the people expected explanation from our assistants this test is the work goes on 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.070
 and they also get explanations about what to do 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.440
 if at a given moment that feeling is emerging 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 and people also have to come back if the test is positive, and then it will follow 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.030
 an investigation by me maybe on a neighborhood investigation and people are not 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 Just referred to the hospital for free and with that the knife cuts 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.340
 two sides 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.620
 kars hair of going hot doctors in the umcg applauds the hay sander initiative 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.739
 show it is a disease that originates as a car in the colon 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.140
 and those police have been around for years and the front wall will be cancer 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.950
 You don't have the chance to find yourself at an early stage as a pro league 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.170
 once colon cancer our little tumor 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.780
 and that probably makes sense if they do so systematically 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.200
 that will probably be the number of other deaths from anp colon cancer 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.649
 doctors have been pushing for years for a grand set up 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.579
 population screening for colon cancer 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.139
 because early detection leads to a greater chance of cure 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 but for the time being, the screening program will not be screened 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.020
 research for colorectal cancer kept certified 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.540
 our government actually offers the possibility in the netherlands 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.910
 because for all sorts of reasons but the biggest reason is actually still 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.420
 too little 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.890
 to be the gastrointestinal liver doctor who then search and do and I find him 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.870
 gives them a nice initiative 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.400
 he gives publicity and measures and I think it is something that should live 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 in public opinion that is very limited with colon cancer 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.430
 and maybe that's a bit of money
