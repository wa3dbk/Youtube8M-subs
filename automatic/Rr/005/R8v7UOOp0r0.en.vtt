version of this game in fact I know

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.869 
version of this game in fact I know
Galaga<00:01:02.930> has<00:01:03.050> recently<00:01:03.470> made<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.280> Xbox

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
Galaga has recently made it to the Xbox

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.290 
Galaga has recently made it to the Xbox
360<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.320> Xbox<00:01:06.440> Live<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:07.610> actually<00:01:08.030> prefer

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
360 and Xbox Live and I actually prefer

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
360 and Xbox Live and I actually prefer
the<00:01:08.740> Atari<00:01:09.740> 7800<00:01:10.340> version<00:01:10.940> I<00:01:11.150> think<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.990> speed

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
the Atari 7800 version I think the speed

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.920 
the Atari 7800 version I think the speed
of<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.500> game<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.040> just<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.640> bit<00:01:13.820> slower<00:01:14.180> and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
of the game is it just a bit slower and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.200 
of the game is it just a bit slower and
that<00:01:14.990> makes<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.410> games<00:01:15.619> last<00:01:15.920> longer<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.729> I

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
that makes the games last longer and I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.370 
that makes the games last longer and I
think<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.600> makes<00:01:17.780> them<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> bit<00:01:18.229> more

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
think that makes them a bit more

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.889 
think that makes them a bit more
challenging<00:01:18.649> and<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> bit<00:01:19.310> more<00:01:19.490> fun<00:01:25.570> every<00:01:26.570> now

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
challenging and a bit more fun every now

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.630 
challenging and a bit more fun every now
and<00:01:27.080> then<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.619> aliens<00:01:28.070> comes<00:01:28.399> down

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
and then one of the aliens comes down

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.960 
and then one of the aliens comes down
with<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.850> tractor<00:01:29.390> beam<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:29.930> can<00:01:30.800> let<00:01:31.759> them

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
with a tractor beam and you can let them

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.120 
with a tractor beam and you can let them
capture<00:01:32.240> your<00:01:32.539> spaceship<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.320> then<00:01:33.979> you

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
capture your spaceship and then you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.160 
capture your spaceship and then you
shoot<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.759> shoot<00:01:34.970> them<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.690> then<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.990> get

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
shoot it you shoot them and then you get

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.840 
shoot it you shoot them and then you get
your<00:01:36.320> spaceship<00:01:36.740> back<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
your spaceship back and then you have a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.980 
your spaceship back and then you have a
double<00:01:38.300> spaceship<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.990> really

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
double spaceship which you can really

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.820 
double spaceship which you can really
wreak<00:01:42.259> havoc<00:01:42.710> upon<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.130> enemy<00:01:43.490> fleet<00:01:43.729> with

two laser blasts is as we all know much
better<00:01:54.650> than<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.040> one<00:01:55.159> laser<00:01:55.640> blast<00:01:57.610> then

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610
