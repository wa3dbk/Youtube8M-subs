ridiculously ridiculously quick they

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770 
ridiculously ridiculously quick they
have<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.680> pace<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.280> their<00:01:47.430> Locker<00:01:47.780> they

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
look how easy is for mural to get away

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
look how easy is for mural to get away
now<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> can't<00:01:54.270> imagine<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:55.200> deadly<00:01:55.560> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
now I can't imagine what how deadly it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
now I can't imagine what how deadly it
would<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.460> partner<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.240> together

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
would be to partner these two together

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
would be to partner these two together
so<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.290> both<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.500> their<00:01:58.860> own<00:01:58.920> like

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so they both have their own like

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
so they both have their own like
specific<00:01:59.790> attributes<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.659> well<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.960> both<00:02:01.170> been

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
specific attributes as well as both been

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.480 
specific attributes as well as both been
ridiculously<00:02:02.280> Pacey<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.329> also<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.490> bit

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
ridiculously Pacey they also have a bit

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240 
ridiculously Pacey they also have a bit
of<00:02:05.520> individuality<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.079> Muriel<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
of individuality with them so Muriel is

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
of individuality with them so Muriel is

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
dribble past do some little skills get

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.160 
dribble past do some little skills get
past<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> players<00:02:18.450> easily<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.019> that

past the players easily with that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.990 
past the players easily with that
whereas<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.620> barbeau<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.459> doesn't<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.970> the

whereas if barbeau it doesn't have the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.759 
whereas if barbeau it doesn't have the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
dribbling but he has the head in you see

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.300 
dribbling but he has the head in you see
there<00:02:25.019> he<00:02:25.319> scores<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.739> header<00:02:25.950> from<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.280> corner

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
there he scores a header from a corner

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
there he scores a header from a corner
he<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.480> much<00:02:27.599> height<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:28.140> much

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
he has so much height and so much

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.140 
he has so much height and so much
strength<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:28.860> much<00:02:28.980> presence<00:02:29.459> that's<00:02:29.909> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
strength of so much presence that's the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.729 
strength of so much presence that's the
main<00:02:30.299> difference<00:02:30.329> between<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.170> mural<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.709> a

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
main difference between the mural is a

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.100 
main difference between the mural is a
more<00:02:31.980> agile<00:02:32.190> smaller<00:02:32.879> better<00:02:33.510> balanced

more agile smaller better balanced

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.960 
more agile smaller better balanced
better<00:02:34.319> dribbling<00:02:34.920> player<00:02:35.159> whereas<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> bar

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
better dribbling player whereas a bar

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.759 
better dribbling player whereas a bar
bow<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.299> all<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> power<00:02:37.079> all<00:02:37.409> about<00:02:37.650> the

strength I don't know what I was doing

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.089 
strength I don't know what I was doing
there<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.299> almost<00:02:39.659> wasted<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.170> goal<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:40.859> a

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
there I almost wasted a goal but a

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.890

to<00:03:13.650> pick<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:15.120> guess<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.569> kind<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.139> have<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.470> say

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
to pick so I guess I kind of have to say

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.379 
to pick so I guess I kind of have to say
a<00:03:16.709> winner<00:03:17.010> now<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.639> gonna<00:03:17.730> be<00:03:17.909> quite<00:03:18.120> tricky

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
a winner now it's gonna be quite tricky

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.869 
a winner now it's gonna be quite tricky
because<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.870> found<00:03:19.199> it<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.799> close<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.819> think

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
because I found it so close but I think

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.199 
because I found it so close but I think
I'm<00:03:21.269> gonna<00:03:21.449> have<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> go<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.669> Muriel<00:03:23.669> on<00:03:24.000> this

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
I'm gonna have to go for Muriel on this

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.390 
I'm gonna have to go for Muriel on this
one<00:03:24.389> purely<00:03:24.810> because<00:03:25.109> he's<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:25.829> much<00:03:26.010> cheaper

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
one purely because he's so much cheaper

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.129 
one purely because he's so much cheaper
and<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.790> four-star<00:03:27.239> skills<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:27.930> both

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
and the four-star skills I think both

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.349
