on as far as like you know you space the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.040 
on as far as like you know you space the
gameplay<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:55.880> based<00:02:56.150> around<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.510> competitive

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
gameplay is based around the competitive

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.720 
gameplay is based around the competitive
aspect<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.590> people<00:02:57.860> fighting<00:02:58.190> each<00:02:58.250> other<00:02:58.430> so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
aspect but people fighting each other so

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.790 
aspect but people fighting each other so
like<00:02:58.880> what<00:02:59.090> are<00:02:59.209> some<00:02:59.450> typical<00:03:00.050> scenarios

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
like what are some typical scenarios

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.170 
like what are some typical scenarios
that<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.160> put<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> players<00:03:01.819> in<00:03:02.000> where

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that you put the players in where

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.250 
that you put the players in where
they're<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.450> fighting<00:03:02.780> against<00:03:02.959> each<00:03:03.050> other

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
they're like fighting against each other

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.290 
they're like fighting against each other
sure<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.400> map<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.730> play<00:03:04.910> today<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
sure so the map that you play today is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.970 
sure so the map that you play today is
called<00:03:05.450> summoners<00:03:05.959> rift<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.530> goal<00:03:06.830> with

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
called summoners rift in the goal with

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.530 
called summoners rift in the goal with
this<00:03:07.010> map<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.730> destroy<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.180> enemy<00:03:08.390> base

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
this map is to destroy the enemy base

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.770 
this map is to destroy the enemy base
and<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:09.709> teams<00:03:10.010> five-on-five<00:03:10.880> PvP

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
and so it's two teams five-on-five PvP

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.840 
and so it's two teams five-on-five PvP
action<00:03:12.200> where<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.860> champions<00:03:13.310> are<00:03:13.430> leveling

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
action where the champions are leveling

how to destroy the enemy's base and so

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.819 
how to destroy the enemy's base and so
you're<00:03:23.660> killing<00:03:23.959> their<00:03:24.079> turrets<00:03:24.410> are<00:03:24.590> killing

their towers you're killing enemy units

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.690 
their towers you're killing enemy units

my<00:03:32.690> experience<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.500> guys<00:03:33.650> seem<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.010> manage<00:03:34.700> to

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
my experience you guys seem to manage to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.140 
my experience you guys seem to manage to
somehow<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.630> cram<00:03:36.100> aspects<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:38.030> know

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
somehow like cram aspects of you know

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.720 
somehow like cram aspects of you know
RTS<00:03:38.900> or<00:03:39.170> RPG<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.860> will<00:03:40.010> normally<00:03:40.370> last<00:03:40.579> few

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
RTS or RPG that will normally last few

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.490 
RTS or RPG that will normally last few
hours<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.480> know<00:03:41.600> level<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.049> stattrak

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
hours like you know level and stattrak

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.930 
hours like you know level and stattrak
and<00:03:42.680> all<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:42.980> I'll<00:03:43.160> seema<00:03:43.459> crammed<00:03:43.730> it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
and all that but I'll seema crammed it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.599 
and all that but I'll seema crammed it
into<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.450> short<00:03:44.750> gameplay<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.769> mean<00:03:46.250> what

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
into this short gameplay so I mean what

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.610 
into this short gameplay so I mean what
was<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.880> challenge<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.420> doing<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.810> that's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
was the challenge and doing it that's

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.259 
was the challenge and doing it that's
that's<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:49.340> pretty<00:03:49.519> big<00:03:49.700> challenge<00:03:49.760> because

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
that's a pretty big challenge because

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.840 
that's a pretty big challenge because
MMOs<00:03:50.989> are<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.500> RPGs<00:03:52.010> historically<00:03:52.670> are

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
MMOs are and RPGs historically are

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.699 
MMOs are and RPGs historically are
really<00:03:53.090> fun<00:03:53.299> because<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.930> know<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.290> kind<00:03:54.650> of

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
really fun because you know you kind of

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.870 
really fun because you know you kind of
represent<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.250> character<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.820> play

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
represent that character that you play

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.430 
represent that character that you play
represents<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.350> know

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
represents you and you you know

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.630 
represents you and you you know
associate<00:03:57.859> your<00:03:57.920> identity<00:03:58.280> with<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.430> guy<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
associate your identity with a guy and

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.039 
associate your identity with a guy and
you<00:03:58.850> level<00:03:59.120> up<00:03:59.209> over<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> long<00:03:59.660> period<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.989> time

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
you level up over a long period of time

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.539 
you level up over a long period of time
and<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.680> we're<00:04:00.920> trying<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.130> figure<00:04:01.220> out<00:04:01.370> you

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
and so we're trying to figure out you

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.040 
and so we're trying to figure out you
know<00:04:01.579> how<00:04:01.790> do

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
know how do

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.410 
know how do
you<00:04:02.110> match<00:04:02.710> that<00:04:02.740> experience<00:04:03.610> where<00:04:03.820> you<00:04:04.150> know

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
you match that experience where you know

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you match that experience where you know
you're<00:04:04.570> leveling<00:04:04.930> up<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.200> they're<00:04:05.290> doing

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
you're leveling up and they're doing

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.050 
you're leveling up and they're doing
these<00:04:05.500> sorts<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.770> things<00:04:05.830> with<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> session

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
these sorts of things with a session

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
these sorts of things with a session
based<00:04:07.150> game<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.170> some<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.560> solutions

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
based game and so some of the solutions

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.010 
based game and so some of the solutions
we<00:04:09.100> had<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.490> one<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.970> create<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.720> same

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
we had is one to create that same

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.840 
we had is one to create that same
experience<00:04:11.290> at<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.740> account<00:04:11.980> level<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.700> it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
experience at the account level that it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.580 
experience at the account level that it
is<00:04:12.970> persistent<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.780> does<00:04:13.960> grow<00:04:14.230> up<00:04:14.350> over<00:04:14.560> a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
is persistent and it does grow up over a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.590 
is persistent and it does grow up over a
long<00:04:14.740> period<00:04:14.770> of<00:04:15.010> time<00:04:15.070> but<00:04:15.670> then<00:04:15.820> also<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.420> the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
long period of time but then also in the

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.720 
long period of time but then also in the
actual<00:04:17.049> game<00:04:17.080> session<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:18.310> saying<00:04:18.549> hey
