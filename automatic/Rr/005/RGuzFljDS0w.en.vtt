00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
could be a short video this week so I'm

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.220 
could be a short video this week so I'm
just<00:03:19.489> going<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:19.670> show<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.900> bit<00:03:21.019> of

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
just going to show you a little bit of

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.069 
just going to show you a little bit of
the<00:03:21.350> progress<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.040> plants<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.810> that

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
the progress on the plants and and that

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.050 
the progress on the plants and and that
will<00:03:24.320> make<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.220> short<00:03:25.400> video<00:03:25.609> this<00:03:25.760> week<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
will make it a short video this week I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.740 
will make it a short video this week I
think<00:03:26.090> short<00:03:26.630> videos<00:03:26.959> are<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:27.380> as

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
think short videos are just as

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.599 
think short videos are just as
educational<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.100> they're<00:03:31.100> just<00:03:31.250> as<00:03:31.400> powerful

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
educational and they're just as powerful

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.370 
educational and they're just as powerful
so<00:03:32.380> we'll<00:03:33.380> see<00:03:33.500> how<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.859> goes<00:03:35.109> okay<00:03:36.109> into

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
so we'll see how this one goes okay into

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.340 
so we'll see how this one goes okay into
the<00:03:36.470> fish<00:03:36.739> tank<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:38.329> goldfish<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.989> put<00:03:39.260> in
