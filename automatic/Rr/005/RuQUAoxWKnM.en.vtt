that there are all sorts of issues that

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.750 
that there are all sorts of issues that
spirals<00:03:51.230> moves<00:03:51.590> which<00:03:51.920> there's<00:03:52.519> one

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
spirals moves which there's one

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
character left to release and hopefully

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.930 
character left to release and hopefully
there<00:03:54.680> aren't<00:03:54.769> as<00:03:54.860> many<00:03:54.890> glitches<00:03:55.489> with<00:03:55.670> that

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
there aren't as many glitches with that

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.449 
there aren't as many glitches with that
character<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.620> lots<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.070> things<00:03:58.340> that

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
character but just lots of things that

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.820

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
weird now no one knows if these are

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.000 
weird now no one knows if these are
components<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.430> our<00:04:23.610> lens<00:04:24.090> based<00:04:24.480> any

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
components that our lens based any

components that our lens based any
components<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.130> really<00:04:26.370> can't<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.060> made<00:04:27.330> out

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
components that really can't be made out

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.900 
components that really can't be made out
of<00:04:27.510> plastic<00:04:27.630> right<00:04:28.560> because<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.580> that's<00:04:29.700> the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
of plastic right because if that's the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.610 
of plastic right because if that's the
case<00:04:30.060> then<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.389> can<00:04:30.540> just<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.050> give
