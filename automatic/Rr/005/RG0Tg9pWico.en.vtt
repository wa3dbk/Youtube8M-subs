00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello i 'm felipe carvalho the first 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 frown of Brazil 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 This is a guide to buying the latest 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.210
 restyling ford fiesta this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.039
 generation I'm here with the 2012 model 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.359
 fly version with 1.6 engine the fiesta is a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.970
 Small hatch released in 1976 by Ford 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.920
 but it only took the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 here in 95 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 this generation was presented in 2002 already 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 with model 2003 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 From there to here were two achievements one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 in the 2008 model and that of the 2011 model 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.239
 I particularly like design 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.329
 original but can not deny that the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.969
 interior improved a lot in 2008 model 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.640
 the car itself has nice design with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.070
 good proportions but this front 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 rounded does not match the lines 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.670
 straight from the car 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 are two concepts of different styles 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.299
 newedge and kynetic in any way 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.030
 maintained headlamps with double reflectors that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.490
 according to Ford are more efficient because 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.360
 offer 50 percent more light volume 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 and 24% more in reach of high beam 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 in practice they are indeed very good 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.240
 already the repeaters too bad 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.720
 as the car does not have on the sides them 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.579
 should stay at the ends of the headlights are 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.460
 two finishing versions 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.939
 this is the input called fly you 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.490
 recognizes by mirrors and door handles 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.090
 without paint and with headlamps with a mask 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.149
 black 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.729
 already the pulse version these items are 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.369
 painted in the color of the car has 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.430
 fog and the headlights are chrome 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.290
 all of them can receive seven 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.719
 options ranging from 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.640
 indispensable air conditioning and steering 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:09.050
 hydraulic up to air bags and abs brakes 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.230
 two engines were offered 1.0 and 1.6 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 all of the zetec family rocam 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.629
 are good, robust and economical engines 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.629
 but the performance is very different 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.110
 while 1.0 suffers to move the thousand and 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.690
 84 pounds of hatch 1.6 does the same 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.239
 task with one foot on the back 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.989
 regardless of how you drive. 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.780
 by me and preferably by the 1.6 engine 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.260
 want to see how both go watch the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 videos of test drive I did as 1.0 and 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.140
 with this 1.6 the suspension hit is 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.299
 something that I always praise in the fiesta one 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.760
 very stable car both at high 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.069
 velocities while in curves and 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.040
 little transmits irregularities 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.250
 ground for perfect occupants 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.769
 the brake is in accordance with the car but 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.680
 who will not give up the abs will have to 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.650
 look for the safety kit item 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.079
 series at every party get alarmed with 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.829
 control of locks on key chain 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.980
 the internal space is a differential above 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.859
 of the category average on this fly version 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.799
 the panel is all black as well as the 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.519
 fabric from the side of the door to the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.130
 driver has height adjustment 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.470
 the glove compartment has lighting and has 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.590
 mirror one of two for actions 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.950
 the pulse version is a bit more refined 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.139
 with silver details in the central part 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.810
 air diffusers door knobs and handle 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.500
 fabrics of the doors equal to those of the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.690
 banks and the uncle on-board computer with 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.970
 exception of this last item I open hand 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.120
 these silver details because they 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.889
 reflected here on the side windows and 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.799
 disrupt visibility 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:01.639
 this feast here he also has 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.200
 power steering 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.359
 air conditioning 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.889
 now the sound system if you bought the 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.190
 which does not come with original sound system 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.139
 and it's okay, the party is that he 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.310
 has this wanted radio size that the 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.169
 floor of 2d 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.880
 you can install any one 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.790
 of these modern multimedia centers 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.750
 look here behind there is space also for 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.420
 the passengers 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.350
 legs do not come or cost much 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.750
 result for my single head position 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.270
 only that comfort and safety only 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.430
 the passengers that go in the tips 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.220
 the passenger here with him and point with a 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 head seat belt support is 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
 abdominal central crop up that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.440
 it 's too loud, it bothers you 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.520
 good internal opening of the trunk or 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.080
 in the key 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:57.310
 the space here is good for a hatch 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.600
 small are 305 liters coated here 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.850
 on the sides but it is unforgivable not to have 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.380
 coating in this part here 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.360
 can see that he is full of risk is 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.360
 unavoidable that this happens 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.100
 Fiesta is a car that I really like and 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.070
 I'm always saying that it's one of the 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.430
 best benefits category benefits 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.550
 prioritize the 1.6 engine most suitable for 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.890
 weight of the car and only buy 1.0 if your 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.320
 does not allow investment in the 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.020
 engine for several reasons. 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.180
 that Ford has done a lot of the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.160
 The faithful have the four most 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.530
 orders air conditioning direction 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.590
 hydraulic windows and electric locks 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.490
 therefore avoid bare-metal versions with 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.050
 relation to other costs such as maintenance 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.630
 to consume safe and 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.000
 depreciation the party is within 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.680
 average of the category and do not give a scare 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.840
 in the owners pocket 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.450
 and to finalize if you need 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.760
 help to buy your car hire 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:01.950
