00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
n64 so I've just mapped this this best

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.380 
n64 so I've just mapped this this best
as<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> comes<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.230> sony<00:00:34.530> pub<00:00:35.390> obviously

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
as it comes on a sony pub obviously

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
as it comes on a sony pub obviously
they're<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> completely<00:00:37.050> different<00:00:37.350> shape<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
they're a completely different shape but

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
they're a completely different shape but
will<00:00:38.460> i'll<00:00:38.969> show<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> how<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> works<00:00:39.570> anyway
