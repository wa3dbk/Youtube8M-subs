00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 you are gone the sun is going to be winning 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.660
 terrain and the high temperatures are going 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.719
 to notice from today in any place of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.120
 Spain until then are 7 and 34 of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.849
 the morning one hour less in the Canary Islands and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 we have about 14 degrees of temperature in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.660
 castile and lion 'and about 20 a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.029
 shores of the Mediterranean and in both 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.550
 archipelagos awakening from low clouds 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 in the interior of Galicia even in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 areas of the Andalusian coasts are going to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.090
 lift and they will lead a pretty day 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.439
 sunny clouds daytime evolution the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 late in mountain areas and not 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.219
 we discard some occasional shower towards 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 the east of pyrenees and the cornice 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.510
 Cantabrian temperatures in the hours 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.960
 Central of the day are going to go up from 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 today we registered yesterday in the southwest 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.160
 temperatures or maximums around 30 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 today the 30 degrees are expected locally 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 on the northern plateau and in the valley of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.210
 ebro del guadiana and the guadalquivir 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 thermometers will exceed 35 and tomorrow 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 we will continue adding and we will spend 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 watch much more heat 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.439
 we will spend much heat because 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.049
 storms are gone the sun is going to go 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.670
 gaining ground and high temperatures 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.820
 will be noticed from today in any 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 place of spain yesterday for example 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.320
 we registered in the southwest about 30 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 maximum degrees today the 30 are expected 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.979
 locally in points of the northern plateau 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 but both in the valley of the guadalquivir 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.210
 and Guadiana as the ebro 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.360
 guadiana and the guadalquivir we are going to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 surpass even the 35 and tomorrow we're going 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
 to spend a lot more heat heat that goes to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 be suffocating also in the north in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 lion for example 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 we expect maximum Monday around 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.179
 the 35 degrees but in Madrid it's also going 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 to raise the temperature in the center that 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.030
 heat is going to notice with 40 of maximum the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.039
 Monday and in Cordoba will not be less 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 because there we are going to overcome even the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.039
 41 and 42 nights are also going to be 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.440
 hot around the 23 or 22 degrees 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.569
 but until then Thursday we have 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.909
 awoke with something more than low clouds 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.129
 both in Galicia and on the coasts 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.880
 Andalusians the sun will be what goes to 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.280
 to learn 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 throughout the country the high temperatures 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.140
 will cause those clouds of evolution in 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.569
 mountain areas of the east and north and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.430
 do not rule out occasional showers 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.880
 in the Iberian turolense in the east of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.099
 Pyrenees and on the Cantabrian coast 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.140
 tomorrow the day will be pretty similar with 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.569
 a lot of sun something more cloudy perhaps 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.430
 retained before the Cantabrian cornice the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.410
 clouds of evolution will remain and the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.080
 sun will be what we have so we 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.849
 they wait for days of skies cleared of 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.019
 a lot of heat that remind us that 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.510
 we have to be especially careful 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.430
 with solar radiation and high the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.430
 fire risk enjoyment
