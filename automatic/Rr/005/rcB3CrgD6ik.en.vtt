Bombardier puller
it<00:00:54.090> should<00:00:54.300> work<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:55.579> now<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.699> I've

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it should work for that now this I've

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
it should work for that now this I've
already<00:00:57.059> loosened<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> careful<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
already loosened to be careful with this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.750 
already loosened to be careful with this
is<00:00:59.039> that<00:01:00.559> it's<00:01:01.559> spring-loaded<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.609> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
is that it's spring-loaded so as you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.450 
is that it's spring-loaded so as you're
back<00:01:02.940> sometimes<00:01:03.449> they'll<00:01:03.660> stick<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:04.140> place

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
back sometimes they'll stick into place

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.859 
back sometimes they'll stick into place
like<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.880> didn't<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.270> tap<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> with

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
like this one didn't I just tap it with

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
like this one didn't I just tap it with
a<00:01:06.930> rubber<00:01:07.200> mallet<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.799> it'll<00:01:08.100> pop<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a rubber mallet and it'll pop up just

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.800 
a rubber mallet and it'll pop up just
keep<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.000> hand<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> doesn't

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
keep your hand there so it doesn't

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.859 
keep your hand there so it doesn't
spring<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.320> fall<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.630> keep<00:01:12.810> your

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
spring out fall down and just keep your

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
spring out fall down and just keep your
hand<00:01:13.290> hold<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> clutch<00:01:14.220> together<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
hand hold the clutch together because it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
hand hold the clutch together because it
will<00:01:15.150> slide<00:01:15.420> apart<00:01:15.689> pretty<00:01:15.990> easily<00:01:16.580> then

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
will slide apart pretty easily then

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
will slide apart pretty easily then
you'll<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:17.909> spring<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.200> which

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you'll have your spring in there which

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
you'll have your spring in there which
comes<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:22.220> easy<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.770> bowl<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.390> your

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
comes out easy also a bowl and your

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
comes out easy also a bowl and your
spring<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> factory

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
spring will just this is just a factory

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
spring will just this is just a factory
spring<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.600> stock<00:01:30.990> its

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
spring in this one it's all stock its

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.660 
spring in this one it's all stock its
first<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> clutch<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.310> makes<00:01:32.460> been

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
first time this clutch it makes been

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.890 
first time this clutch it makes been
touched<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> one

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.300 

now<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> reason<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.100> taking<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> off

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
now the reason I'm taking this one off

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
now the reason I'm taking this one off
is<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.570> inspected<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.900> it's<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.220> pucks

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
is I inspected and it's got the pucks

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.140 
is I inspected and it's got the pucks
are<00:01:44.700> worn<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.580> was<00:01:47.640> making<00:01:48.000> quite

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
are worn out on it so I was making quite

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.730 
are worn out on it so I was making quite
a<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.510> noise<00:01:48.630> writing<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
a bit of noise writing it so when I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
a bit of noise writing it so when I
wrote<00:01:49.920> her<00:01:50.040> those<00:01:50.190> parts<00:01:50.550> up<00:01:50.730> someplace<00:01:51.300> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
wrote her those parts up someplace that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.800 
wrote her those parts up someplace that
everything<00:01:52.080> else<00:01:52.200> looks<00:01:52.440> pretty<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
everything else looks pretty good on it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.120 
everything else looks pretty good on it
next<00:01:54.810> part<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.050> shouldn't<00:01:55.320> spike<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.010> other

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
next part you shouldn't spike the other

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
next part you shouldn't spike the other
thing<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.550> these<00:01:56.730> two<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.120> can<00:01:57.300> leave<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
thing with these two you can leave the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.280 
thing with these two you can leave the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
I just use a bolt the right thread it's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.359 
I just use a bolt the right thread it's
got<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.690> long<00:02:06.900> enough<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.250> your

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
got to be long enough and one of your

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.510 
got to be long enough and one of your
holes<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.990> threaded<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:11.250> thread

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
holes here will be threaded to thread

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.850 
holes here will be threaded to thread
that<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.820> it'll<00:02:12.120> expand<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.720> secondary<00:02:13.260> die

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860

just your belt will slide right off but
like<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.770> said<00:02:16.830> these<00:02:17.220> run<00:02:17.460> on<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.090> I've

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
like I said these run on this one I've

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.140 
like I said these run on this one I've
already<00:02:18.300> had<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> part<00:02:19.020> once<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.070> check<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
already had a part once and I check the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
already had a part once and I check the
bearings<00:02:21.540> there's<00:02:21.870> two<00:02:22.020> little<00:02:22.230> seal

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
bearings there's two little seal

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.290 
bearings there's two little seal
bearings<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:24.950> ride<00:02:25.950> dime<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.060> just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
bearings this ride dime and this is just

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.980 
bearings this ride dime and this is just
you're<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.560> seal<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.990> sounds

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
you're just a seal on there sounds

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
you're just a seal on there sounds
pretty<00:02:31.200> simple<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> lid<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.760> said

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
pretty simple it's a lid but like I said

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.250 
pretty simple it's a lid but like I said
it's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> lot<00:02:33.300> different<00:02:33.450> than<00:02:33.690> snow<00:02:34.020> real

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it's a lot different than snow real

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.190 
it's a lot different than snow real
punch<00:02:34.530> how<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.610> comes<00:02:35.790> apart<00:02:36.200> because

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
punch how it comes apart because

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.840 
punch how it comes apart because
basically<00:02:37.410> how<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.890> works<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> same<00:02:38.610> idea

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.220 

now<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.700> said<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.330> here<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
now like I said this one here is just I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.660 
now like I said this one here is just I
don't<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:46.980> if<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.340> hear<00:02:47.520> that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
don't know if you can hear that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.830 
don't know if you can hear that
committee<00:02:48.060> abut<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:51.360> picture<00:02:51.690> die

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
committee abut it's just picture die

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.290 
committee abut it's just picture die
when<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.230> running<00:02:52.770> makes<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.670> lot<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:53.850> plays

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
when it's running makes a lot more plays

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.960 
when it's running makes a lot more plays
than<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.709> that's<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.980> reason<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.400> pulling

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
than that so that's the reason I pulling

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.729 
than that so that's the reason I pulling
this<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.239> apart<00:02:57.480> I'm<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:58.050> sure<00:02:58.290> how<00:02:58.440> much<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
this one apart I'm not sure how much the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.000 
this one apart I'm not sure how much the
parts<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.100> haven't<00:02:59.310> priced<00:02:59.459> them<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.790> yet<00:03:01.010> but

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
parts I haven't priced them out yet but

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.280 
parts I haven't priced them out yet but
yeah<00:03:02.489> that's<00:03:02.790> basically<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.630> then<00:03:04.080> when<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
yeah that's basically and then when you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.090 
yeah that's basically and then when you
just<00:03:04.470> quote<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:06.320> okay<00:03:07.320> one<00:03:07.500> more<00:03:07.650> thing<00:03:07.709> on

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
just quote it okay one more thing on

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.440 
just quote it okay one more thing on
this<00:03:08.340> clutch<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.150> are<00:03:09.300> gonna
