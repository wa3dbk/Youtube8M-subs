top of the knot and then you find out
where<00:02:18.890> your<00:02:19.010> ends<00:02:19.280> wind<00:02:19.579> up<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.599> can<00:02:20.750> see

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
where your ends wind up so you can see

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.509 
where your ends wind up so you can see
I've<00:02:21.319> got<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.709> ends<00:02:25.010> coming<00:02:25.189> out<00:02:25.400> in

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
I've got the ends coming out in

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.490 
I've got the ends coming out in
different<00:02:25.730> parts<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.359> that<00:02:26.689> last<00:02:26.900> loop<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.470> I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
different parts of that last loop and I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.319 
different parts of that last loop and I
want<00:02:27.680> both<00:02:27.950> ends<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.310> come<00:02:28.549> out<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.060> same

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
want both ends to come out in the same

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.690 
want both ends to come out in the same
part<00:02:29.689> of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.810> loop<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.310> have<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.489> take

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
part of the loop so I just have to take

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.509 
part of the loop so I just have to take
a<00:02:31.760> look<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.439> can<00:02:33.620> see<00:02:33.859> what<00:02:34.400> i<00:02:34.430> can

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
a look at this and I can see what i can

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.709 
a look at this and I can see what i can
do<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.980> pull<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.549> back<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.299> little<00:02:38.540> bit

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
do is pull this one back a little bit

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.099 
do is pull this one back a little bit
and<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.650> want<00:02:39.829> it<00:02:39.889> to<00:02:39.920> follow<00:02:40.370> its<00:02:41.269> mate

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
and I just want it to follow its mate

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.399 
and I just want it to follow its mate
there<00:02:42.439> so<00:02:42.799> I'm<00:02:43.069> gonna<00:02:43.900> put<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.019> back<00:02:45.139> through

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
there so I'm gonna put it back through

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.420 
there so I'm gonna put it back through
and<00:02:45.970> then<00:02:46.970> that'll<00:02:47.450> dress<00:02:47.629> down<00:02:48.400> snug<00:02:49.400> down

not barrel knots an attractive not and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.160 
not barrel knots an attractive not and
what<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.819> does<00:03:20.909> is<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.150> provides<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.930> nice<00:03:24.170> tight

owned I'm going to use this as a wrist
carry<00:03:38.549> option<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.629> if<00:03:39.750> I'm<00:03:39.900> working<00:03:40.319> with<00:03:40.500> the

bar I can have it hanging from my wrist

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.030 
bar I can have it hanging from my wrist
and<00:03:42.810> if<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.019> don't<00:03:43.079> have<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.379> little<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.739> here

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
and if I don't have this little not here

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.839 
and if I don't have this little not here
that<00:03:44.790> leaves<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.209> bar<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> little<00:03:46.560> too

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
that leaves the bar on just a little too

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.110 
that leaves the bar on just a little too
close<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:47.879> my<00:03:48.480> underside<00:03:49.409> of<00:03:49.439> my<00:03:49.560> arm<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.220> I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
close to my underside of my arm and I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
close to my underside of my arm and I
don't<00:03:51.599> want<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.810> banging<00:03:51.989> into<00:03:52.349> me<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:53.069> it's

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
don't want it banging into me if it's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.649 
don't want it banging into me if it's
dangling<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.819> swinging<00:03:54.090> about<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.510> and

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
dangling and swinging about there and

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.970 
dangling and swinging about there and
that<00:03:54.989> not<00:03:55.169> will<00:03:55.379> actually<00:03:55.590> give<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> little<00:03:55.859> bit

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
that not will actually give a little bit

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.729 
that not will actually give a little bit
of<00:03:56.040> standoff<00:03:56.459> protection<00:03:57.030> it'll<00:03:57.989> it'll

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
of standoff protection it'll it'll

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.899 
of standoff protection it'll it'll
provide<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.189> bit<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.400> buffer<00:03:59.730> zone

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
provide a little bit of buffer zone

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.020 
provide a little bit of buffer zone
there<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:01.129> that's<00:04:02.129> why<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.730> barrel

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there so that's why I like that barrel

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.309 
there so that's why I like that barrel
not<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:04.099> okay<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:05.629> now<00:04:06.629> we're<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.109> do

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
not there okay so now we're going to do

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.190 
not there okay so now we're going to do
a<00:04:07.939> second<00:04:08.939> barrel<00:04:09.180> not<00:04:09.359> now<00:04:09.689> you<00:04:09.750> see<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:09.959> our

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
a second barrel not now you see that our

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440 
a second barrel not now you see that our
ends<00:04:10.439> are<00:04:10.530> much<00:04:10.739> more<00:04:11.010> closely<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.239> same

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
ends are much more closely the same

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.030 
ends are much more closely the same
length<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.349> I'm<00:04:13.439> still<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.799> take<00:04:13.919> my

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
length so I'm still going to take my

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.360 
length so I'm still going to take my
longer<00:04:14.430> end<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.470> want<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.739> eyeball

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
longer end and I just want to eyeball

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.699 
longer end and I just want to eyeball
how<00:04:18.150> much<00:04:18.389> space<00:04:18.659> I<00:04:18.870> need<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.139> there<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.470> got

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
how much space I need in there I got

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.050 
how much space I need in there I got
gloves<00:04:19.949> I<00:04:20.190> went<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.370> little<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.669> extra<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:21.030> case

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
with that one I'm sorry if I fell out a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.339 
with that one I'm sorry if I fell out a
frame<00:05:03.380> there<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.680> didn't<00:05:04.870> paint<00:05:05.870> close<00:05:06.110> enough

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
frame there it didn't paint close enough

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:14.580 
frame there it didn't paint close enough
attention<00:05:09.370> that's<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.460> real<00:05:10.699> small<00:05:11.000> barrel<00:05:11.360> not

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:24.629 

but<00:05:15.590> it'll<00:05:15.860> do

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.180 

ok<00:05:25.639> so<00:05:25.970> I<00:05:26.360> really<00:05:26.870> needed<00:05:27.050> one<00:05:27.260> more<00:05:27.290> turn<00:05:27.889> I

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
ok so I really needed one more turn I

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.400 
ok so I really needed one more turn I
might<00:05:29.000> go<00:05:29.120> back<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.419> redo<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.200> you<00:05:30.320> get

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
might go back and redo that but you get

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.220 
might go back and redo that but you get
the<00:05:30.470> idea<00:05:31.780> yep<00:05:32.780> I<00:05:34.750> mean<00:05:35.750> that'll<00:05:35.930> do<00:05:36.020> for<00:05:36.169> now

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
the idea yep I mean that'll do for now

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.450 
the idea yep I mean that'll do for now
and<00:05:36.830> there<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:37.850> have<00:05:38.169> enough<00:05:39.169> links<00:05:39.770> for<00:05:39.980> a

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
and there I have enough links for a

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.860 
and there I have enough links for a
wrist<00:05:41.210> carry<00:05:41.480> even<00:05:41.750> if<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:41.900> have<00:05:42.050> gloves<00:05:42.260> on<00:05:42.470> and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
wrist carry even if I have gloves on and

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.909 
wrist carry even if I have gloves on and
I've<00:05:44.870> got<00:05:45.020> still<00:05:45.230> a<00:05:45.260> little<00:05:45.380> bit<00:05:45.560> extra<00:05:45.680> left

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
I've got still a little bit extra left

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.340 
I've got still a little bit extra left
so<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.250> think<00:05:46.460> if<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.610> can<00:05:46.700> go<00:05:46.790> back<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.350> probably

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
so I think if I can go back and probably

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.740 
so I think if I can go back and probably
retie<00:05:48.830> that<00:05:49.070> not<00:05:49.250> get<00:05:49.940> one<00:05:50.090> more<00:05:50.210> turn<00:05:50.450> out<00:05:50.660> of

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
retie that not get one more turn out of

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.840 
retie that not get one more turn out of
that<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.860> will<00:05:51.980> give<00:05:52.070> me<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.220> better<00:05:52.430> barrel

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
that that will give me a better barrel

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.820 
that that will give me a better barrel
not<00:05:53.000> on<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.389> end<00:05:53.630> eat<00:05:54.290> up<00:05:54.410> a<00:05:54.500> little<00:05:54.680> bit<00:05:54.770> of

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
not on this end eat up a little bit of

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.379 
not on this end eat up a little bit of
this<00:05:54.889> cordage<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:55.490> then<00:05:55.970> what<00:05:56.060> I'll<00:05:56.150> do<00:05:56.270> is

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
this cordage and then what I'll do is

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.390 
this cordage and then what I'll do is
I'll<00:05:56.450> just<00:05:56.660> use<00:05:56.960> this<00:05:56.990> for<00:05:57.410> a<00:05:57.440> while<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:57.979> see

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
I'll just use this for a while and see

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.629 
I'll just use this for a while and see
how<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.850> like<00:05:59.180> this<00:06:00.110> lanyard<00:06:00.530> finish<00:06:01.010> and<00:06:01.250> if

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
once I've decided that you know this is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.500 
once I've decided that you know this is
what<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.710> want<00:06:04.190> to<00:06:04.250> keep<00:06:04.430> then<00:06:05.000> I'll<00:06:05.090> finish<00:06:05.240> off

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.360 
what I want to keep then I'll finish off
these<00:06:05.660> ends<00:06:05.990> I'll<00:06:06.080> clip<00:06:06.350> them<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.740> just<00:06:07.130> melt

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
these ends I'll clip them and just melt

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.030 
these ends I'll clip them and just melt
the<00:06:07.520> ends<00:06:07.790> on<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.930> earlier<00:06:09.500> wrap<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.830> I<00:06:09.889> had

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
the ends on the earlier wrap that I had

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.090 
the ends on the earlier wrap that I had
done<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.220> had<00:06:10.460> put<00:06:10.669> the<00:06:10.790> little<00:06:10.970> plastic

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
done I had put the little plastic

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.390 
done I had put the little plastic
paracord<00:06:13.100> end<00:06:13.490> tags<00:06:14.389> on<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.500> end<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:16.010> figure

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
paracord end tags on the end I figure

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.469 
paracord end tags on the end I figure
out<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.580> columns<00:06:16.850> little<00:06:17.120> things<00:06:17.240> that<00:06:17.360> look

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
out the columns little things that look

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.969 
out the columns little things that look
like<00:06:17.510> this<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:19.580> what<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:20.389> found<00:06:20.540> was<00:06:20.770> dug<00:06:21.770> on<00:06:21.950> it

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
like this and what I found was dug on it

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.850 
like this and what I found was dug on it
it<00:06:22.340> was<00:06:22.460> hard<00:06:22.639> to<00:06:22.669> get<00:06:22.790> off<00:06:22.940> and<00:06:23.830> with<00:06:24.830> a

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
paracord wrap on a tool like this you

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.260 
paracord wrap on a tool like this you
might<00:06:27.590> actually<00:06:27.800> need<00:06:28.280> to<00:06:28.340> use<00:06:28.460> the<00:06:28.640> paracord

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
might actually need to use the paracord

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.560 
might actually need to use the paracord
itself<00:06:30.430> in<00:06:31.430> a<00:06:31.550> particular<00:06:31.850> situation<00:06:32.180> you

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
itself in a particular situation you

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.029 
itself in a particular situation you
might<00:06:32.690> get<00:06:32.900> in<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:33.289> that's<00:06:33.770> one<00:06:33.919> of<00:06:33.950> the

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
might get in and that's one of the

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.740 
might get in and that's one of the
advantages<00:06:34.160> for<00:06:34.729> doing<00:06:34.940> a<00:06:35.000> paracord<00:06:35.360> handle

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
advantages for doing a paracord handle

advantages for doing a paracord handle
wrap<00:06:35.870> as<00:06:36.050> you<00:06:36.169> have<00:06:36.289> that<00:06:36.440> power<00:06:36.590> cord
