00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
very easy now what I've done first is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.529 
very easy now what I've done first is
there<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:01.640> your<00:01:02.640> air<00:01:02.789> filter<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> your

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there is your your air filter and your

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
there is your your air filter and your
air<00:01:03.660> filter<00:01:03.930> housing<00:01:04.080> sits<00:01:04.589> right<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
air filter housing sits right here that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
air filter housing sits right here that
pops<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> problem<00:01:06.869> I'm<00:01:07.530> taking

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
pops right off not a problem I'm taking

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
pops right off not a problem I'm taking
the<00:01:07.920> battery<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.520> sets<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.970> there's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the battery out that sets here there's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
the battery out that sets here there's
also<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.020> tray<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> goes<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> holds

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
also the tray that goes here that holds

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
also the tray that goes here that holds
the<00:01:11.400> battery<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.720> four<00:01:12.900> or

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the battery I think it's like four or

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
the battery I think it's like four or
five<00:01:13.020> screws<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> comes<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
five screws it comes right out

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.359 
five screws it comes right out
everything's<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.509> easy<00:01:15.979> as<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.159> see

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
everything's very easy as you can see

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.210 
everything's very easy as you can see
here<00:01:17.790> I've<00:01:17.970> disconnected<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> hose<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
here I've disconnected the hose here

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
here I've disconnected the hose here
that<00:01:20.400> goes<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> radiator<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.470> warn

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that goes to the radiator I will warn

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.630 
that goes to the radiator I will warn
you<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> prepared<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> rag<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:25.009> here<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you be prepared to put a rag in here you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.649 
you be prepared to put a rag in here you
will<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.740> drip<00:01:28.740> edge<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
will get a little bit of a drip edge and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.380 
will get a little bit of a drip edge and
so<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.270> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
so now there is a as you can see here we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
so now there is a as you can see here we
have<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:35.360> little<00:01:36.360> outer<00:01:36.570> edge<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
have the little little outer edge of the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
have the little little outer edge of the
car<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> piece<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> sits<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.479> it's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
car there is a piece that sits here it's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
car there is a piece that sits here it's
I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.009> four<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.549> screws<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I think it's like four little screws it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
I think it's like four little screws it
comes<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.920> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
comes right off and then you have this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.710 
comes right off and then you have this
piece<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> sits<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.270> top<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
piece here that sits on top of the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.490 
piece here that sits on top of the
radiator<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.600> things<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.990> really

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
radiator so I know things are really

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
radiator so I know things are really
kind<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> close<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.909> I'll<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
kind of close here I'll put that back in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
kind of close here I'll put that back in
