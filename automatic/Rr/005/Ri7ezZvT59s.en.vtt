00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello very good to all welcome to the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.500
 channel of home experiments today we're going 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 to make a home projector for the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.770
 laptop 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.490
 the new girl who gives in and has asked us 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.100
 that we make this invention so here's what 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.890
 you have and for this we need tape 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.800
 wide adhesive a marker a box 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 large cardboard a cutter and a lens 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.619
 learn what you can find by 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.810
 internet easily on sites like ebay 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.160
 at a very simple price before you start 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 we have to check that the box 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 Carton is big enough to 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.369
 that fits the laptop screen 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.560
 as you see the screen of our 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
 Portable fits perfectly the first 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.350
 step is to cut on the opposite side 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.390
 where will the screen of our 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 computer a rectangle the size of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 our fresnel lens we place the lens 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.030
 and we make some points with the marker in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.989
 the four corners 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 and the mimes 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 next we have to cut the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.699
 box rectangle as always have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.699
 beware of the cutter 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.219
 we have to line the edge with the tape 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219
 wide 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 Now we have to place the lens 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.030
 snail in the gap that we have left 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.980
 the scraping part has to be 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.520
 looking in and we hit it with 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.520
 more painted 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.400
 once ready we have to cut back on the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 opposite side a rectangle of size 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.340
 from the screen of our computer 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 we make some marks in the corners 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.189
 but you have to do it a little bit more 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.189
 small 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.509
 and cut it with the cutter 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.510
 to finish we have to put more 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.550
 tape in the gap that we have left for 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.780
 the laptop screen and cover all 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.780
 the holes where light can enter 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.850
 and it is ready as you see 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.610
 we put the brightness to the maximum and what 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.280
 We put it inside out 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.170
 now let's try it you have to do 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.000
 carlos or push it to the wall until 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.000
 find the optimal point of focus 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.780
 we can see that the areas of a species 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.220
 of clients we will control that for 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.220
 I understand what it consists 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.010
 Y
