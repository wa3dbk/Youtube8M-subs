my<00:01:08.970> Manny<00:01:09.600> said<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> toughest<00:01:10.680> fight

my Manny said it was the toughest fight

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
my Manny said it was the toughest fight
he<00:01:11.040> ever<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:13.580> was<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> true

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
he ever had and was that the true

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
he ever had and was that the true
statement<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.009> because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
statement I think so it's because

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
statement I think so it's because
margarito<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.360> only<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> keep<00:01:19.049> coming

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
doubt in my mind mm-hmm now that during

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.690 
doubt in my mind mm-hmm now that during
the<00:02:11.069> fight<00:02:11.340> margarito<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:12.390> weighing<00:02:12.599> 165

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
yeah but by the time he got in the ring

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.920 
yeah but by the time he got in the ring
he<00:02:16.769> was<00:02:16.890> waiting<00:02:17.099> what<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.849> was<00:02:18.030> 17<00:02:18.569> pounds

margarita<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:23.849> 165<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.959> keep<00:02:25.650> wondering<00:02:25.950> why

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
margarita was 165 I keep wondering why

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.300 
margarita was 165 I keep wondering why
the<00:02:27.510> referee<00:02:27.720> does<00:02:28.140> not<00:02:28.319> stop<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> fight<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the referee does not stop the fight just

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.580 
the referee does not stop the fight just
because<00:02:29.640> he<00:02:29.790> could<00:02:29.940> count<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.569> or<00:02:30.840> two<00:02:31.079> uno

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
because he could count one or two uno

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.589 
because he could count one or two uno
dos<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.579> ok<00:02:32.879> but<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.239> about<00:02:33.450> the
