 Hello dear site visitors 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.080
 terroro dot com in this video tutorial I 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 I would like to tell you about cleaning 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 drives drives is internal memory 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 our computer local drives 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.449
 another is called the hard drive he is more often 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.039
 just broken into two parts on disk c and on 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.660
 drive d and they regularly get clogged up 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.050
 clean them of unnecessary information and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 unnecessary files and so how to do it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 go to my computer let's start first 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.780
 clean the disk c everything is done it is very 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 just right click on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 drive c select the item properties here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 choose an item 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.010
 disk cleaning here are all files 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.039
 users on this computer too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.559
 choose an item 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 lead ask a few questions a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.739
 xp and in others if I'm not mistaken not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.559
 is set but if set click 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 continue yes and so on like that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 Click in general here now the program 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.840
 cleaning evaluates the amount of space when 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.790
 a lot of unnecessary files it can 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.510
 take but it says it can 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.510
 take a few minutes 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.649
 Here I really estimated a few 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.509
 minutes because a lot of files 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.640
 only a week did not clean from a lot 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.470
 plucked my advice somewhere and clean 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.960
 once a week so as not to pollute your 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.520
 drive's everywhere stand to stand here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.860
 ticks if you are not worth something 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.600
 put down that is now let's say empty 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.299
 click left cell here 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.970
 the mouse is the volume of the release 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.200
 space 419 gigabytes that's fine 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.720
 a lot is enough and press ok is set 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.789
 question and confirm delete files 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 now there is a disk cleaning it is by the way 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:05.860
 may also take a few minutes if 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.720
 much too clean but more often if 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 once a week you will not clean 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.989
 will be badly hammered so do 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.989
 it's regular 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.690
 so here comes the cleaning process for everyone not for him 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.550
 all cleared click ok and also do and 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.480
 disk d 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:37.480
 right -click properties 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 disc cleaning files of all users 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.630
 Continue now again will be evaluation 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.950
 but my assessment went quickly only 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the basket click ok delete occurs 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.280
 the removal process here is strictly speaking and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.550
 everything turned out so small simple 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.090
 lesson 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.850
 click ok nothing complicated here 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.930
 do it regularly and trouble you on 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.910
 computer will be less 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.360
 thank you for your attention and see you in
