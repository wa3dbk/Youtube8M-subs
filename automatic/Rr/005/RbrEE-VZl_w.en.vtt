do I like to go on this map when I spawn
on<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.310> side<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.840> usually<00:00:27.930> cut

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on that side because you can usually cut

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
on that side because you can usually cut
some<00:00:28.890> people<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.340> who<00:00:29.869> come<00:00:30.869> from<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> other

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
some people off who come from the other

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.040 
some people off who come from the other
side<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> building<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.050> this

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
side up in that building and this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
side up in that building and this
building<00:00:34.110> seems<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> very<00:00:35.460> hot<00:00:35.969> spot<00:00:36.300> on

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
building seems to be a very hot spot on

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.229 
building seems to be a very hot spot on
the<00:00:36.600> map<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.309> pretty<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.460> area<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> hang<00:00:39.090> out

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the map so pretty good area to hang out

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
the map so pretty good area to hang out
if<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.530> high<00:00:40.649> killstreaks

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
if you're going for high killstreaks

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.139 
if you're going for high killstreaks
because<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.520> usually<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.760> high

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
because it is usually a very high

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.440 
because it is usually a very high
traffic<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.370> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.700> stay<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.180> toes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
traffic so if you can stay on your toes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.049 
traffic so if you can stay on your toes
and<00:00:48.870> keep<00:00:49.620> her<00:00:49.770> calm<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.789> quite<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and keep her calm you can get quite a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.319 
and keep her calm you can get quite a
few<00:00:51.120> kills<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> yeah<00:00:53.190> anyway<00:00:53.730> using<00:00:54.210> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.570 
but um yeah pick up this sounds AK and I
was<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.170> using<00:02:46.440> sounds<00:02:46.890> weapons<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.400> game

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
was just using sounds weapons this game

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.380 
was just using sounds weapons this game
and<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.349> helped<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.739> while<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:51.120> for

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and think that helped me while going for

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.259 
and think that helped me while going for
this<00:02:51.480> MIB<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.349> people<00:02:52.920> were<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.400> flocking

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
this MIB get a people were just flocking

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.280 
this MIB get a people were just flocking
to<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.720> dots<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> radar<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:57.260> bees<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to the dots on the radar like bees to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.420 
to the dots on the radar like bees to
honey<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.370> game<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:01.099> using<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.159> sounds

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
honey in this game so using a sounds

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.089 
honey in this game so using a sounds
weapon<00:03:02.760> definitely<00:03:03.209> helps<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.989> stay<00:03:04.800> off<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
weapon definitely helps you stay off the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.290 
weapon definitely helps you stay off the
radar<00:03:05.280> was<00:03:06.269> using<00:03:06.569> our<00:03:06.810> line<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.400> mean<00:03:08.400> ideally

that<00:04:26.670> are<00:04:26.850> thinking<00:04:27.480> realistic<00:04:28.140> for<00:04:28.320> me<00:04:28.440> to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
that are thinking realistic for me to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.980 
that are thinking realistic for me to
