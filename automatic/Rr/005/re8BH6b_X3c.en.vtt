00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.250
 10 feature films that is also a whole 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.559
 an event in previous years we had 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.929
 had an average of 6 to 8 adaptations 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.140
 from comic to feature film to movies 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.360
 fiction cinema and good this 2014 is going 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.399
 to uncover with 10 adaptations per 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.869
 Of course they are all blockbuster and 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:26.180
 Of course all of them are 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.529
 especially expected the turtles 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.329
 ninja for me that are a classic of the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.099
 childhood will surely be a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.809
 classic that everyone is going to 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.730
 like it because not only are you 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.649
 childhood but of several generations and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.960
 we are seeing the images of what 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.630
 will be this adaptation of the turtles 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.340
 ninja I the truth I think I wish them 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.670
 go pretty well I think that's why 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.500
 that is a classic is something that is a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.010
 traditional movie somehow 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.630
 images that we already know will be 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.460
 complicated but surely they will have a 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.739
 captive audience people will go see them 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.210
 who knows if they like it or not but what 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.890
 that yes they are going to be there you know what 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.950
 has happened with the ninja turtles there 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.680
 to mention that it's a comic that came up 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.240
 practically a coincidence of two 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.670
 cartoonists 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.049
 a very curious moment that they had some 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.820
 turtles and how are we going to convert 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.780
 some turtles in superheroes what 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 they got 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.320
 they made a comic that was very famous and 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030
 then exactly the images that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 we are seeing at this moment the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710
 adaptation the first animated adaptation 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 of the ninja turtles in the decade 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.960
 the 90s as you remember they have the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.000
 names of four painters artists 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.979
 Italians that rafael miguel angel or 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.340
 donatello and wants to miss for girls 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.619
 the student 4 and good this adaptation 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.619
 has had different versions as 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.360
 over the years and well now it has 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.420
 this version that is like much more 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.799
 digital subsequently has gone as 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.259
 renewing the genre and well that has 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.060
 allowed to have the spectators 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.369
 very captive calls a lot of attention 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 savior that you're this kind of 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.110
 movies this type of characters then 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.119
 they go from generation to generation and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.159
 really the kids are going from another 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.630
 way entering the phenomenon that 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.429
 you lived in your childhood that you no longer 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.870
 you know him first he's not already 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.870
 spent a little bit of years
