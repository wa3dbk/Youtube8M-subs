00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello speaks to them saw bringing the second 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.850
 part of this quick guide for rogues 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.889
 let's talk about macro rotations 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.530
 Useful tips to improve your style of 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.419
 game and those recommended without further 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.780
 say we start with this second part 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.780
 of fall 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.710
 there is no fixed type of rotation 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.110
 everything depends on how the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 combat but when we have the combat 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.550
 controlled that is to say the target is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.440
 turning in the case of the rogue can be 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.660
 follow a rotation to achieve a good 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.660
 dps let's see the following example 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.160
 this is a clear example of a combat 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.570
 controlled we started with a low blow 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.570
 followed mutilated fingers to put together 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 hit points on the kidneys 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 a poke to point in doses of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 poisons a way of life ar 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 and another less than 2 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.680
 with that since we went down quite a bit 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.280
 of the goal and we can continue with a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 blindness of smoking that necessary layer of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.509
 the shadow 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 it instantly removes all 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.820
 negative effects of spells with what 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.450
 which I do not 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.630
 l'hospitalet and we can go back to the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.630
 rotation 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 and soldier 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 and we finished 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 with the other 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.890
 there are lots of macro 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.619
 with the guiding target line what it does is 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.630
 eliminate the one that we currently have with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.010
 the girl target enemy player 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.900
 what it does is to contest the enemy 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.900
 and with the bar rank 4 what it does is 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.610
 punish the popu 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.610
 the bang of rank 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.979
 let's see how this macro works 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.150
 previously 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.550
 we see that I have the same cut 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.160
 the prices in the macro 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.610
 He takes me out of little and looks for what he gave more 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:29.180
 close we do not have 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.950
 I focus three times and I run for 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 I do not notice that very 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.170
 I will not go into this in depth 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.040
 macros because they seem totally to me 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.140
 you can use more macros than 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.610
 at least with the end also always 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.070
 stretch of the game you can find 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.050
 infinity of macros help buildings 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.050
 from europe but for me 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.870
 the first thing we're going to talk about in this 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.830
 section of you that seems to me the most 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.900
 important is how to start a fight 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.680
 against people that stop you from tallies 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.060
 so much more than a death horse 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.140
 for a hunter 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.270
 we can use by objective we have 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.310
 degrees and it will not use any area 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.050
 to be able to approach and do the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290
 rotation in controlled combat 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.989
 also in quantity for reason to be 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.780
 sure that we can throw the field of 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.780
 the shadow that makes us immune 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.720
 against people who do not use any 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.470
 type of area we can open directly 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.550
 with hitting stuning it for four 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.870
 seconds commenting the rotation too 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.870
 we can use embroidery 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.700
 with strakes but we can use 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.790
 any of the previous two but it 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.370
 recommends deleting them and instead of striking 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.319
 under using this rice and what it does 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.500
 is to rotate the enemy without turning on or 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.290
 for three seconds including two thousand 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.620
 818 year points last 18 seconds 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.620
 increased by attack can always 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 to vary 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.350
 what does this 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.750
 silence the objective you want to say 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.430
 they can not throw away areas in freezing 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.250
 in the case of standard 2 interest 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.319
 transport and throw fear and so on 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.789
 etc. Personally, I prefer 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.789
 use club hire 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.650
 equipment tips 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.089
 achieve faster application of the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.099
 poisons I recommend using one more dagger 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:00.689
 quick the of fun in the apple that is 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:04.620
 use a dagger with the right hand 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.960
 increased and slow damage 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.990
 and in the left hand a given with damage 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.510
 reduced but faster let's remember that 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 forget about things and poison 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.990
 It depends 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.000
 on Saturdays that I use and recommend are 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.970
 the following Sundays for a 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.510
 total customization of the bar 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.420
 power is also be and software for 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.850
 improve the bar of castelló avvac acb 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.070
 and I also use this senator 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.930
 interesting because it shows us in the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.170
 center the important data screen 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.350
 as our hp and dell of the objective 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:50.010
 our energy and energy the objective 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.900
 of the mana etcétera and castella or not 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.950
 create an extras bar showing the 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.080
 punishment time among other things I 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.289
 I find it quite useful for the 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.689
 chopped 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.180
 well with this we end this 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.550
 second part of this quick guide for 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.680
 thank refine jury for taking part 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.479
 as a training doll until soon 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.479
 see you in another video
