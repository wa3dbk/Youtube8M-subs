00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.650
 hey my dear 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.080
 I do make a cage clean today 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.750
 no idea how to call that 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
 and yes, that's why I'm feeling right now 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.480
 on this cardboard 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.629
 I have my mice on the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.830
 top floor shipped so I just 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.199
 this plate can stand out with it 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.970
 I come to the aquarium and with it 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.860
 I just can not sit out here somewhere 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.559
 yes already a bit failed 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.019
 I'll say that in a minute and now 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.320
 first these floors will be vacated empty 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.629
 and then we'll meet again like that 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.799
 I have everything from the second floor 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:06.100
 cleared to the top and the races 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:10.600
 now around here and yes let's see how 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.369
 long now I need this and so on 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.539
 Looks like this is all up here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.399
 and here is just the whole thing 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.909
 puzzle and they have up here now 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.909
 your fun 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:49.010
 yes and you have to first the level here 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.500
 clean and Pizarro aquarium and here 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.090
 I can now see the plane like that 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
 good as clean fly here just like that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.180
 small things around 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.140
 They are now gone with the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.610
 sucked and yes that is with the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.730
 simplest method around this whole 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.800
 to get rid of small dust crumb remnants 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.390
 but if you also have a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.610
 used you are sure that I am 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.880
 no more animals on this level or 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.920
 in the cage so that just no 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.720
 there is danger for the animals 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 always make sure that really no 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.100
 animals are more on the same level 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
 and then there is no danger for 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.620
 the animals so now I have the plains 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 sucked the upper so elise and the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.560
 below now i use this one 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.270
 piece of wood just to lift this level 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 so the whole looks like this now i have 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.630
 the wooden beam here 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.620
 supported and there I am great 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.620
 the aquarium ran 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.490
 so I have now by hand 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.120
 I started to do it myself 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.790
 I still have these stairs from this one 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 warehouse and so you can too 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.840
 great 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.209
 so if you had the whole thing or 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.800
 as good as empty 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.260
 you already have a longtime 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.730
 part behind you or I have 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.130
 him now behind me yes all of us 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 then sucked and then briefly 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.350
 there is already the new bedrock so 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 all empty now and then I show 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.150
 Now what about me then me too 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.150
 wealth 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.290
 the whole is finished now I have 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.320
 now several layers hay and the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.300
 different streams and that too 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.480
 paper I flew the party 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.280
 used and that's how it looks now 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.710
 From here I have a bridge 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:11.690
 on top of that, it's the role of them 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:18.709
 the whole thing is about me now 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.360
 30-30 to 40 cm and up there 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.780
 also just something because fall here 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.120
 already the first things out yes and then 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.470
 right now that one more 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.950
 and then they can go down like that again 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.540
 now everything is ready the set up 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.070
 small maneuvers are sitting somewhere down there 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.740
 and yes I will now both 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.880
 remove the bridge but show it first 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:48.200
 I'll leave you like it untidy 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.780
 looks tidy and indeed stands here 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.610
 the impeller because I now have his 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.820
 mother put it so not too loud 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.390
 that if I run in here then how 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.730
 before also the cottage with the scissors 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.550
 with the shell on it then here 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.290
 passes 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.540
 I think here again a bridge 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:13.520
 down when the aquarium is clean 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.740
 Here is everything as before 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.310
 That's how I would be nervous 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.310
 mice here 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.279
 open the gates 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.930
 so that they can again 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.010
 the remains and so below the 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.240
 of course clean again and theirs 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.780
 both little man could have now 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.780
 also down again 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:07.440
 it's been going on for quite some time now 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.880
 time in a new aquarium rum tequila 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.880
 leaves somehow in coming 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:07.020
 I hope you could do one now 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.479
 win small impression as I like that 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.740
 cage clean as I said, although now 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.569
 also the first time that i use this one 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.439
 but it did not clean 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.479
 big difference 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.199
 I mean the aquarium I have before 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:21.209
 just cleaned 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:25.189
 yes the whole thing was now a thing of me 

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:28.080
 believe maybe at the hour 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:33.899
 and the mice are happy here now 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.759
 also full 1 off I think so that is 

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:38.779
 Everything worked out fine if you did 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.779
 I do not jump out of here 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.630
 all I could also swim like 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:08:00.419
 yes and then I thank you for 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.419
 watch and see you next video 

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.010
