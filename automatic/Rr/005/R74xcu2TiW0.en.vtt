00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
most I don't really have a favourite

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
most I don't really have a favourite
discipline<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.850> cycling<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.540> like

to<00:01:34.020> combine<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.619> different<00:01:35.040> things<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to combine the different things and I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
to combine the different things and I
think<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.570> helped<00:01:36.930> me<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> different

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
think it helped me do the different

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.760 
think it helped me do the different
things<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.780> ownership<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
things because take ownership that the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.700 
things because take ownership that the
bike<00:01:40.920> handling<00:01:41.490> exclusivity<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:43.409> tracker

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bike handling exclusivity the tracker

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.179 
bike handling exclusivity the tracker
the<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.579> reason<00:01:45.200> Rose<00:01:46.200> Road<00:01:46.619> race<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the this reason Rose Road race the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.690 
the this reason Rose Road race the
tactics<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.479> longer<00:01:48.780> distances<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
tactics and the longer distances so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
tactics and the longer distances so
sometimes<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> find<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.229> balance<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
sometimes you have to find a balance and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.600 
sometimes you have to find a balance and
it<00:01:53.009> hasn't<00:01:53.820> been<00:01:54.149> always<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.740> think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it hasn't been always right but I think

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.289 
it hasn't been always right but I think
I<00:01:56.759> managed<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.290> do<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> quite<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I managed to do it quite good so I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.870
