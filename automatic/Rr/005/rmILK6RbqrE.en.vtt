00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
finger okay I'm going to go ahead and do
just<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.890> quick<00:03:17.069> chop<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.450> just

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
just a quick chop on this so you just

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.180 
just a quick chop on this so you just
kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.840> get<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.020> idea<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.610> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
kind of get the idea here and you just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.930 
kind of get the idea here and you just
about<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> quarter<00:03:23.970> inch<00:03:24.120> pieces<00:03:24.450> are<00:03:25.019> good

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
about a quarter inch pieces are good

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.220 
about a quarter inch pieces are good
it's<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.239> about<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:27.930> just

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it's just about that and we have just

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.770 
it's just about that and we have just
about<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.500> quarter<00:03:28.950> cup<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:30.300> bit<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.600> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
about a quarter cup a little bit more I

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.250 
about a quarter cup a little bit more I
think<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.890> we're<00:03:32.100> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> add<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.550> in

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
think that we're going to add that in

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.030 
think that we're going to add that in
we're<00:03:34.260> going<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.440> turn<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.769> back<00:03:34.830> on<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
we're going to turn this back on and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.240 
we're going to turn this back on and
turn<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.069> back<00:03:38.190> down<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.730> low<00:03:39.000> heat<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:40.250> little

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
turn it back down to a low heat a little

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.190 
turn it back down to a low heat a little
bit<00:03:41.430> more<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.730> there<00:03:41.819> we've<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.269> about<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.510> cup

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
bit more in there we've just about a cup

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.040 
bit more in there we've just about a cup
and<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.380> half<00:03:43.410> or<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.330> honey<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.780> pot

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
and a half or so in the of honey and pot

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.770 
and a half or so in the of honey and pot
now<00:03:46.890> sage<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.519> cinnamon<00:03:48.209> are<00:03:48.300> not<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.540> only

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
now sage and cinnamon are not the only

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.150 
now sage and cinnamon are not the only
herbs<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.470> use<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.800> can<00:03:49.920> use<00:03:49.950> pretty

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
a good balance there mister this back up

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.600 
a good balance there mister this back up
again<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:06.450> let<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:07.160> in<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.370> you're

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
again and just let this in this you're

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.770 
again and just let this in this you're
essentially<00:04:09.090> making<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.989> tea<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:11.100> honey

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780
