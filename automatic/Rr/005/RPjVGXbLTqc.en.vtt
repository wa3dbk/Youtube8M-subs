00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
might actually happen in real life and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.310 
might actually happen in real life and
I've<00:00:07.859> had<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.130> happen<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.490> me<00:00:08.700> too<00:00:09.320> somebody

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
I've had this happen to me too somebody

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.350 
I've had this happen to me too somebody
walks<00:00:10.530> by<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.250> grabs<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:11.969> the

get out of it so jeff has a great thing

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.609 
get out of it so jeff has a great thing
to<00:00:17.699> teach<00:00:18.240> us<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.690> tell<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.529> we're

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to teach us so tell them what we're

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.630 
to teach us so tell them what we're
going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:20.160> we'll<00:00:20.279> show<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
going to do and then we'll show it to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609 
going to do and then we'll show it to
you<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.820> real<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.900> basic<00:00:22.199> scenario

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you in real time so the basic scenario

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.720 
you in real time so the basic scenario
we're<00:00:22.859> working<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.250> this

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.950 

right<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.030> I<00:00:28.090> can't<00:00:28.330> get<00:00:28.390> out<00:00:28.540> of<00:00:28.690> that<00:00:28.780> you

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
right and I can't get out of that you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
going to do is take a step back with

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.569 
going to do is take a step back with
that<00:00:33.760> leg<00:00:33.940> at<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.300> same<00:00:34.360> time<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:35.140> hand

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.919 

this<00:00:39.699> arm<00:00:39.879> straight<00:00:40.179> backwards<00:00:40.449> with<00:00:40.809> this

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
this arm straight backwards with this

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.580

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that is fate gianni ready for it does

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
that is fate gianni ready for it does
just<00:00:53.280> happen<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.790> slow<00:00:54.480> nice<00:01:02.450> for<00:01:03.450> him

back and press them at the same time you
use<00:01:09.810> their<00:01:09.960> physics<00:01:10.290> against<00:01:10.620> them<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.010> then

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
use their physics against them and then

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.040 
use their physics against them and then
you<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.370> keep<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.840> keep

other<00:01:38.940> way<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.270> give<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.660> my<00:01:39.810> hand<00:01:40.110> back<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
other way like give me my hand back it's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.960 
other way like give me my hand back it's
not<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> work<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.940> think

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
not going to work so you have to think

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
not going to work so you have to think
about<00:01:42.240> where<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> week<00:01:43.410> card

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
about where the week card

about where the week card
press<00:01:45.549> away<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:45.969> now<00:01:46.420> they're<00:01:46.570> completely

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
press away so now they're completely

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.319 
press away so now they're completely
off-balance<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:48.070> keep<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.280> going<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:49.000> kind

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
off-balance just keep that going I kind

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.669 
off-balance just keep that going I kind
of<00:01:49.420> want<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.630> close<00:01:49.840> line<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.380> with<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.560> other

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
of want to close line it with the other

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.240 
of want to close line it with the other
hand<00:01:50.979> too<00:01:51.189> but<00:01:51.520> it's<00:01:52.329> like<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.950> okay<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.100> works

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
hand too but it's like it okay it works

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.910 
hand too but it's like it okay it works
it<00:01:54.490> works<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:55.509> right<00:01:55.719> so<00:01:56.380> after<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:56.829> get

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it works that's right so after we get

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.819 
it works that's right so after we get
done<00:01:56.979> filming<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.850> had<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> question<00:01:58.270> because<00:01:59.020> I

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
done filming I had a question because I

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.740 
done filming I had a question because I
had<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.219> hard<00:02:00.520> time<00:02:00.579> getting<00:02:01.210> out<00:02:01.329> of<00:02:01.450> one<00:02:01.630> of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
had a hard time getting out of one of

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.449 
had a hard time getting out of one of
the<00:02:01.810> holes<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.469> I<00:02:02.649> realized<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.310> was<00:02:03.399> a

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
the holes and I realized that it was a

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.649 
the holes and I realized that it was a
little<00:02:03.610> bit<00:02:03.759> different<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.360> could<00:02:04.539> do

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
little bit different and I could do

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.600 
little bit different and I could do
something<00:02:04.689> different<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.590> Jeff<00:02:05.829> tell<00:02:06.399> me<00:02:06.490> what

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
something different so Jeff tell me what

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.889 
something different so Jeff tell me what
to<00:02:06.670> do<00:02:06.759> in<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.000> case<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.450> works<00:02:07.630> really

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
to do in that case and this works really

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.240 
to do in that case and this works really
well<00:02:08.080> too<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.769> you<00:02:08.830> want<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> give<00:02:09.129> you<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
well too so you want to give you a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.180 
well too so you want to give you a
little<00:02:09.340> bonus<00:02:09.549> right<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:11.019> again<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> weak

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
little bonus right now so again the weak

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800 
little bonus right now so again the weak
part<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.489> my<00:02:12.549> group<00:02:12.760> Sadie<00:02:13.299> still<00:02:13.569> needs<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
part of my group Sadie still needs to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.390 
part of my group Sadie still needs to
figure<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.049> how<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> get<00:02:14.349> her<00:02:14.500> grip<00:02:14.799> how<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
figure out how to get her grip how to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
figure out how to get her grip how to
get<00:02:15.610> her<00:02:15.879> arm<00:02:16.299> out<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.780> grip<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.110> what

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
get her arm out of that grip so what

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.920 
get her arm out of that grip so what
she's<00:02:17.380> going<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> do<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:18.069> she's<00:02:18.280> gonna<00:02:18.400> twist

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
she's going to do is she's gonna twist

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.360 
she's going to do is she's gonna twist
right<00:02:19.930> yeah<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.410> sometimes<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.069> hard

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
right yeah because sometimes it's hard

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.059 
right yeah because sometimes it's hard
to<00:02:21.549> with<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.599> my<00:02:22.870> straight<00:02:23.140> arm<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.829> get<00:02:23.980> out

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
to with with my straight arm to get out

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.860 
to with with my straight arm to get out
of<00:02:24.099> such<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> strong<00:02:24.700> grip<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> case

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
of such a strong grip if that's the case

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.559 
of such a strong grip if that's the case
there's<00:02:26.200> another<00:02:26.410> thing<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.480> now

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
there's another thing you can do so now

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.030 
there's another thing you can do so now
she's<00:02:28.750> gonna<00:02:28.840> actually<00:02:29.230> twist<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.829> pull<00:02:30.010> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
she's gonna actually twist and pull it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.020 
she's gonna actually twist and pull it
up<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.049> talking<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.530> tail

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.430 

what<00:02:38.030> I'm<00:02:38.150> gonna<00:02:38.300> do<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.480> turn<00:02:38.780> my<00:02:39.020> arm<00:02:39.260> just

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
what I'm gonna do is turn my arm just

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.860 
what I'm gonna do is turn my arm just
like<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.950> not<00:02:40.520> too<00:02:40.970> much<00:02:41.120> i'm<00:02:41.270> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> turn<00:02:41.690> my

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
like a not too much i'm going to turn my

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.380 
like a not too much i'm going to turn my
arm<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.470> naturally<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.490> it's<00:02:43.670> facing<00:02:43.910> that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
arm just naturally so it's facing that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.300 
arm just naturally so it's facing that
little<00:02:44.690> exit<00:02:45.170> point<00:02:45.410> part<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> group

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
little exit point part of the group

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
little exit point part of the group
right<00:02:46.760> not<00:02:47.060> too<00:02:47.270> much<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.510> know<00:02:47.930> whatever<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
right not too much you know whatever and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.630 
right not too much you know whatever and
then<00:02:48.650> i'm<00:02:48.770> gonna<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.070> same<00:02:49.310> thing

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
then i'm gonna do the same thing

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.360 
then i'm gonna do the same thing
telephone<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.380> close<00:02:51.650> by<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.130> know<00:02:52.190> that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
telephone and close by I don't know that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.220 
telephone and close by I don't know that
was<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:52.610> my<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:53.000> didn't<00:02:53.390> say<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:54.080> you

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
was just my I didn't say that but you

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.960 
was just my I didn't say that but you
keep<00:02:54.380> walking<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.010> keep<00:02:55.100> pressing<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.790> that

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
keep walking and keep pressing like that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.850 
keep walking and keep pressing like that
so<00:02:56.180> sometimes<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.690> can<00:02:56.840> turn<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.470> do<00:02:57.680> that

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
so sometimes you can turn and do that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.950 
so sometimes you can turn and do that
this<00:02:58.550> might<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.790> strong<00:02:59.150> for<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.780> may

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
this might be strong for you this may

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.870 
this might be strong for you this may
work<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.350> either<00:03:00.470> grip<00:03:00.740> right<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.580> same

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
work with either grip right so same

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
work with either grip right so same
thing<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.630> aware<00:03:02.840> of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
thing but you have to be aware of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.470 
thing but you have to be aware of
where's<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.560> weak<00:03:03.770> part<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> my<00:03:04.190> trip<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.420> I'm

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
where's my weak part of my trip so I'm

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.730 
where's my weak part of my trip so I'm
gonna<00:03:05.600> just<00:03:05.720> turn<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.170> little<00:03:06.200> bit<00:03:06.500> see<00:03:06.620> how

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
gonna just turn it a little bit see how

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.730 
gonna just turn it a little bit see how
you<00:03:06.800> turn<00:03:07.070> my<00:03:07.250> arm<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.550> enough<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.990> be<00:03:09.500> facing

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
you turn my arm just enough to be facing

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.470 
you turn my arm just enough to be facing
the<00:03:10.130> stronger<00:03:10.490> part<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:10.970> when<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.210> start<00:03:11.420> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the stronger part so when I start to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.560 
the stronger part so when I start to
pull<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.870> out<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.860> I'm<00:03:12.920> not<00:03:13.070> here<00:03:13.610> I'm<00:03:13.820> really

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
pull it out so I'm not here I'm really

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.600 
pull it out so I'm not here I'm really
turned<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.200> blade<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.590> out<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:16.130> then<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.340> step

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
turned to blade it out and then I step

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.250 
turned to blade it out and then I step
back<00:03:16.640> right<00:03:17.330> when<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.600> step<00:03:17.810> back<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:18.110> when

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
back right when you step back as when

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
back right when you step back as when
you<00:03:18.290> pull<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:18.800> where<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.040> have<00:03:19.250> your

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
you pull out that's where you have your

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.830 
you pull out that's where you have your
center<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.610> gravity<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:20.690> going

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
center of gravity and it's not going

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.820 
center of gravity and it's not going
well<00:03:21.050> like<00:03:22.010> i<00:03:22.130> wanted<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.490> do<00:03:22.730> right<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.990> want<00:03:24.770> to

well like i wanted to do right I want to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.830 
well like i wanted to do right I want to
play<00:03:25.100> like<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> bell<00:03:25.580> arena<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.480> air<00:03:26.630> I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
play like a bell arena up to the air I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.510 
play like a bell arena up to the air I
am<00:03:27.260> going<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.530> get<00:03:27.650> low<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:27.950> my<00:03:28.190> center<00:03:28.490> of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
am going to get low to my center of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.970 
am going to get low to my center of
gravity<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.240> come<00:03:29.870> down<00:03:30.080> here<00:03:30.440> at<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.740> same

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
gravity and come down here at the same
