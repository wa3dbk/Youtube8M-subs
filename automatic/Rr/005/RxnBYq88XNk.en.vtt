 it flips in one day to direct us to Scandinavia the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 particular emotions 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.800
 if the trio stay 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 the belgium na mur especially 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.900
 what we wanted is done 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.260
 effectively 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.480
 to travel% and discover them but on top of that we wanted to make sure that 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.910
 this undergrowth yage some serve for something is certain 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.810
 to other people in case 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.120
 coursan for which chosen work chosen as theme education 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.540
 the environment 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.540
 % l education the environment so younger generations 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.599
 why we will be in touch 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.089
 during our trip 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.559
 with a school room of the French community I had 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.549
 also want to 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.469
 participate in them in some way in their adventure and make them enjoy 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.909
 children 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.699
 and then I find that with 6th grade students it was an opportunity to 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.959
 hang up a topic taboo 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.859
 the adventure that was most proud 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.120
 as well indeed the old hope that in French why not put in 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.580
 as well 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.580
 for example in geography of this will allow me to discover 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.449
 many countries I'm not used to dealing with 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.089
 percent I will also be able to exploit a little side for 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.209
 the giant story high-deûle 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.189
 for example school life around the world across different countries 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.719
 and to show the children the chance to get back to school 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.340
 in other countries 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.319
 that's why m 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 throughout the journey we will 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.859
 jay-z met in hama cements of people who live 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.019
 e 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.510
 the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.350
 the problem of the day-to-day environment 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.999
 who can help us testimonial 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.449
 p 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.900

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.269
 school youth 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.209
 thanks to a website that we put on line thanks to a 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.800
 block 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.320
 it is necessary to contact as regularly as possible with them the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.110
 different schools with so we will put on this site of the scion 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.489
 interviews of photos of videos of people we meet 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.639
 three hours on the spot 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.639
 we will try to do as much as possible is to have a dialogue with God 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.909
 church schools 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.989
 in such a way that for any eventuality we are brought 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.669
 pro-rated information 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.689
 emc 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.920
 we renew will give information to investigators 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.900
 I even project child procession 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.179
 specifies that it 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:10.119
 percent of students in small groups are responsible in the 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.609
 black for six hours 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.799
 that period they will follow via the TV website 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.930
 misadventure US debt declined to 1 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.220
 and then it takes percent and ask them questions 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.080
 asked for information and seven catches so that they could then 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.930
 the milky way% e all their challenges little to the other sixth classes 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.980
 knocked at a + their doors 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.970
 we have support from qliktech partners of institutional partners 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.230
 so we were pleased to see that the united nations program for 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.240
 the environment 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.140
 we relax in our approach it projects 40 m to 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.449
 immediately after 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.849
 by its energizing energizing side for the thought 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.090
 energizing for the environment 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.020
 energy 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.969
 for each of them 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:01.939
 and 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.809
 thought that corresponded caen 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.629
 in haguenau daily profitation 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.979
 next I consider 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.150
 like for example this 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.169
 I think these two young people are our ambassadors 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.370
 somehow 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.370
 and to go to places 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.509
 maybe just 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.990
 as an institution 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.820
 and percent 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.050
 I dared to hope 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.259
 always energy and enthusiasm 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.259
 16 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.540
 different school contact people 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.960
 a crossing 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.210
 we met stone 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.210
 through the projects he works on 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.199
 fuel depots
