00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
what's going on guys called to mush back

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.249 
what's going on guys called to mush back
at<00:00:01.860> it<00:00:01.979> with<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.100> $400<00:00:02.879> gaming<00:00:03.389> PC<00:00:03.750> build<00:00:03.990> now<00:00:04.140> if

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
at it with a $400 gaming PC build now if

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.599 
at it with a $400 gaming PC build now if
you<00:00:04.380> go<00:00:04.560> ahead<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.890> take<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.220> look<00:00:05.430> at<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
you go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.889 
you go ahead and take a look at the
description<00:00:06.150> box<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.540> look<00:00:06.690> at<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
description box and you look at the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.210 
description box and you look at the
parts<00:00:07.200> less<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.680> might<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> little

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
parts less you might be a little

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.009 
parts less you might be a little
surprised<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.059> might<00:00:09.210> think<00:00:09.450> mush<00:00:09.719> why<00:00:09.960> are

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
surprised you might think mush why are

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.509 
surprised you might think mush why are
you<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.469> an<00:00:10.590> Intel<00:00:10.920> option<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
you going with an Intel option in this

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549 
you going with an Intel option in this
build<00:00:11.759> when<00:00:11.969> at<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> $400<00:00:12.809> budget<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.290> makes<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
build when at a $400 budget it makes a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.740 
build when at a $400 budget it makes a
lot<00:00:13.679> more<00:00:13.740> sense<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.340> go<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.910> AMD<00:00:15.269> build

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
lot more sense to go with in AMD build

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.120 
lot more sense to go with in AMD build
well<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> couple<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.529> days<00:00:16.680> ago<00:00:16.830> somebody

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
well a couple of days ago somebody

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.650 
well a couple of days ago somebody
commented<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.119> videos<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
commented on one of my videos and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.929 
commented on one of my videos and
requested<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.289> $400<00:00:20.160> bill<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.580> actually

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
requested a $400 bill they actually

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
requested a $400 bill they actually
requested<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> $350<00:00:22.380> build<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.769> went<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> $400

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
requested a $350 build I went with $400

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.640 
requested a $350 build I went with $400
and<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.150> asked<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> bill<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.050> easily

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and they asked for the bill to be easily

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
and they asked for the bill to be easily
upgraded<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> future<00:00:26.820> now<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> go

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
upgraded in the future now if you go

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.700 
upgraded in the future now if you go
with<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> AMD<00:00:27.840> option<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.439> probably

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
with the AMD option you're probably

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.929 
with the AMD option you're probably
going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.130> better<00:00:29.340> performance<00:00:29.550> than

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
going to get better performance than

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
going to get better performance than
this<00:00:30.269> Intel<00:00:30.689> bill<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> problem<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
this Intel bill but the problem with the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.410 
this Intel bill but the problem with the
AMD<00:00:32.250> option<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> don't<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> lot<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
AMD option is you don't have a lot of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.120 
AMD option is you don't have a lot of
upgrade<00:00:33.809> ability<00:00:33.930> options<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> terms<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
upgrade ability options in terms of the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
upgrade ability options in terms of the
CPU<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.090> build<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.540> more<00:00:36.750> future

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
CPU so I think this build is more future

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.569 
CPU so I think this build is more future
proof<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> guy<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
proof if you're the kind of guy that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
proof if you're the kind of guy that
does<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> upgrade<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> say<00:00:39.809> an<00:00:39.930> i-5<00:00:40.350> down

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
does want to upgrade to say an i-5 down

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
does want to upgrade to say an i-5 down
the<00:00:40.770> line<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.430> build<00:00:41.730> otherwise

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the line go with this build otherwise

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
the line go with this build otherwise
I'll<00:00:42.480> leave<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> AMD<00:00:43.320> option<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I'll leave the AMD option in the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
I'll leave the AMD option in the
description<00:00:44.340> box<00:00:44.489> down<00:00:44.640> below<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
things off with the CP of this build I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
things off with the CP of this build I
went<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> intel<00:00:49.079> pentium<00:00:49.260> g<00:00:49.710> 3250<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> 3.2
