okay<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.130> now<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.849> our<00:00:12.799> word<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.920> cool

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
okay so now we have our word is cool

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.670 
okay so now we have our word is cool
down<00:00:14.340> below<00:00:14.610> 70<00:00:14.969> degrees<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.660> now<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.470> time

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
down below 70 degrees and now it's time

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.529 
down below 70 degrees and now it's time
to<00:00:16.740> go<00:00:17.070> ahead<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.340> put<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> word<00:00:18.000> into<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
to go ahead and put the word into the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
to go ahead and put the word into the
Erlenmeyer<00:00:18.779> flask<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.949> first<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.279> need<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.490> use

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Erlenmeyer flask so first we need to use

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.849 
Erlenmeyer flask so first we need to use
a<00:00:20.609> funnel<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.020> remember<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.590> this

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
a funnel and you remember I have this

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.160 
a funnel and you remember I have this
spray<00:00:23.550> bottle<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:24.300> sanitizing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
spray bottle a little sanitizing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
spray bottle a little sanitizing
solution<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> stars'<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> I'm<00:00:27.240> gonna

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
solution with the stars' and I'm gonna

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.550 
solution with the stars' and I'm gonna
go<00:00:27.480> ahead<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.630> spray<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> whole<00:00:28.170> inside<00:00:28.500> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
go ahead and spray the whole inside of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.189 
go ahead and spray the whole inside of
this<00:00:28.740> thing<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> entire<00:00:30.570> outside<00:00:30.990> over

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this thing and the entire outside over

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
this thing and the entire outside over
the<00:00:31.230> sink<00:00:31.590> let<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> drip<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the sink let it just kind of drip here

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.180 
the sink let it just kind of drip here
for<00:00:34.820> 15-20<00:00:35.820> seconds

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.250 

and<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.090> get<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.270> advantage<00:00:41.450> of<00:00:41.690> using<00:00:41.750> stars

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
and you get the advantage of using stars

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.570 
and you get the advantage of using stars
saying<00:00:42.500> is<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.970> really<00:00:44.630> does<00:00:44.960> only<00:00:45.200> take

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
saying is that it really does only take

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.330 
saying is that it really does only take
15-20<00:00:46.580> seconds<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.920> your<00:00:48.920> equipment

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
15-20 seconds and your equipment

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.979 
15-20 seconds and your equipment
anything<00:00:49.790> that<00:00:50.030> comes<00:00:50.150> in<00:00:50.270> contact<00:00:50.420> with<00:00:50.720> this

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
anything that comes in contact with this

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.910 
anything that comes in contact with this
and<00:00:51.530> nothing<00:00:52.400> afterwards<00:00:52.910> is<00:00:53.330> good<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.230> go<00:00:54.379> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and nothing afterwards is good to go you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.770 
and nothing afterwards is good to go you
don't<00:00:55.160> need<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.400> hit<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:55.970> again<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:56.360> water<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
don't need to hit it again with water to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.380 
don't need to hit it again with water to
rinse<00:00:56.900> away<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:57.260> foam<00:00:57.559> off<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.879> good<00:00:59.269> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
rinse away this foam off this is good to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.570 
rinse away this foam off this is good to
go<00:01:02.110> okay<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:03.470> we've<00:01:03.590> got<00:01:03.620> things<00:01:03.980> cooled<00:01:04.369> off

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
go okay so we've got things cooled off

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.230 
go okay so we've got things cooled off
we've<00:01:04.970> got<00:01:05.089> our<00:01:05.180> funnel<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:06.940> sanitized<00:01:07.940> so

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
we've got our funnel here sanitized so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.570 
we've got our funnel here sanitized so
now<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.540> just<00:01:08.600> time<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.869> pour<00:01:09.410> our<00:01:10.220> cooled

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
now it's just time to pour our cooled

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:23.500 
now it's just time to pour our cooled
wort<00:01:11.170> into<00:01:12.170> our<00:01:12.290> flask

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.100 

all<00:01:24.050> right

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
all right

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.690 
all right
a little<00:01:26.770> bit<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.950> foam<00:01:27.220> with<00:01:27.400> it<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> little

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
a little bit of foam with it a little

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.790 
a little bit of foam with it a little
bit<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.880> aeration<00:01:28.150> that's<00:01:28.570> fine<00:01:28.900> that's<00:01:29.140> good

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
bit of aeration that's fine that's good

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.120 
bit of aeration that's fine that's good
yeast<00:01:30.220> loves<00:01:31.110> oxygen<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.500> aeration<00:01:32.890> that's

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
yeast loves oxygen in aeration that's

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.710 
yeast loves oxygen in aeration that's
fine<00:01:35.070> okay<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.790> something<00:01:37.330> else<00:01:37.450> I've<00:01:37.600> been

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
fine okay so something else I've been

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.170 
fine okay so something else I've been
doing<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.050> I<00:01:38.110> forgot<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.530> mention<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.970> have

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
doing that I forgot to mention is I have

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.650 
doing that I forgot to mention is I have
been<00:01:40.330> sanitizing<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.640> wand<00:01:43.060> over<00:01:43.300> here<00:01:43.540> that

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
been sanitizing this wand over here that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.450 
been sanitizing this wand over here that
we<00:01:43.750> use<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.260> connect<00:01:44.620> to<00:01:44.830> our<00:01:44.860> oxygen

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
we use that we connect to our oxygen

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.020 
we use that we connect to our oxygen
tank<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.940> oxygenate<00:01:46.540> our<00:01:46.900> beer<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.820> wand

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
tank to oxygenate our beer so the wand

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.330 
tank to oxygenate our beer so the wand
again<00:01:49.630> sanitize<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.350> goes<00:01:50.530> into<00:01:51.040> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
again sanitize just goes into the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.760 
again sanitize just goes into the
starter<00:01:51.760> beer<00:01:51.940> here<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.200> connects<00:01:53.560> this

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
starter beer here and it connects this

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.230 
starter beer here and it connects this
oxygen<00:01:54.150> tank<00:01:55.150> through<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.810> hose<00:01:56.080> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
oxygen tank through this hose and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.910 
oxygen tank through this hose and
through<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.330> regulator<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.990> end<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.440> as

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
through this regulator on the end and as

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.570 
through this regulator on the end and as
we<00:02:00.160> go<00:02:00.369> ahead<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:01.170> release<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.200> oxygen<00:02:02.580> it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
we go ahead and release the oxygen it's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.810 
we go ahead and release the oxygen it's
gonna<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.080> oxygen<00:02:05.470> into<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.710> beer<00:02:06.160> yeast

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
gonna put the oxygen into the beer yeast

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.990 
gonna put the oxygen into the beer yeast
needs<00:02:07.180> oxygen<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.770> thrive<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.489> reproduce

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
needs oxygen to thrive and to reproduce

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.880 
needs oxygen to thrive and to reproduce
so<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.450> gonna<00:02:10.630> make<00:02:10.899> us<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.410> really<00:02:11.620> healthy

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so it's gonna make us a really healthy

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.210 
so it's gonna make us a really healthy
environment<00:02:12.489> for<00:02:12.970> our<00:02:13.750> beer<00:02:14.170> here<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:15.040> as<00:02:15.130> we

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
environment for our beer here so as we

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.949 
environment for our beer here so as we
begin<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.580> open<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.480> threads<00:02:16.720> who<00:02:16.840> you're

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
begin to open the threads who you're

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.339 
begin to open the threads who you're
gonna<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.530> oxygen<00:02:17.830> start<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> come<00:02:18.400> out

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.559 

and<00:02:24.859> there<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.129> go<00:02:25.249> you<00:02:26.150> want<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.299> turn<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
and there you go you want to turn it

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.880 
and there you go you want to turn it
down<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.840> don't<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.109> it<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> come<00:02:27.469> out<00:02:27.620> too

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
down you don't want it to come out too

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.959 
down you don't want it to come out too
quickly<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:29.650> for<00:02:30.650> such<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.859> small<00:02:31.249> volume<00:02:31.760> of

but we have this nice creamy fluffy head
now<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.299> here<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.139> East<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:46.040> gonna

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
now and here that the East is just gonna

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.599 
now and here that the East is just gonna
go<00:02:46.370> crazy<00:02:46.639> over<00:02:47.349> you<00:02:48.349> know<00:02:48.650> oxygenation<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
go crazy over you know oxygenation is

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.280 
go crazy over you know oxygenation is
something<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:49.969> really<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.510> take<00:02:50.870> your<00:02:51.049> beer

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
something that really can take your beer

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.000 
something that really can take your beer
to<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.469> next<00:02:51.739> level<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:53.329> just<00:02:54.169> makes<00:02:54.379> such

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
to the next level and it just makes such

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.520 
to the next level and it just makes such
a<00:02:55.040> healthier<00:02:55.819> environment<00:02:55.909> for<00:02:56.419> your<00:02:56.840> East<00:02:59.530> so

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
a healthier environment for your East so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.099 
a healthier environment for your East so
again<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.829> see<00:03:00.859> here<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:02.359> nice<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.629> creamy

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
again you see here just nice and creamy

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.709 
again you see here just nice and creamy
that's<00:03:03.919> probably<00:03:04.400> enough<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.359> we're<00:03:05.510> going<00:03:05.629> to

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
that's probably enough so we're going to

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.149 
that's probably enough so we're going to
turn<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.079> off<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.739> should<00:03:09.889> be<00:03:09.980> good<00:03:10.099> to

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
turn this off and we should be good to

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.170 
turn this off and we should be good to
go<00:03:10.280> okay

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.970 

so<00:03:14.419> now<00:03:14.569> we<00:03:14.629> have<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.139> beer<00:03:15.319> oxygen<00:03:15.799> through

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
so now we have the beer oxygen through

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.490 
so now we have the beer oxygen through
that<00:03:16.129> work<00:03:16.370> oxygenated<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:18.199> we<00:03:18.260> just

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
that work oxygenated and now we just

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.659 
that work oxygenated and now we just
gonna<00:03:18.680> need<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:18.919> go<00:03:19.010> ahead<00:03:19.129> and<00:03:19.340> add<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> yeast

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
gonna need to go ahead and add the yeast

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.909 
gonna need to go ahead and add the yeast
and<00:03:19.849> we're<00:03:20.000> done<00:03:20.379> so<00:03:21.379> again<00:03:21.590> we<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:21.889> our

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
and we're done so again we have our

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.179 
and we're done so again we have our
sanitized<00:03:22.609> funnel<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.709> see<00:03:24.949> in<00:03:25.069> our

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
sanitized funnel in here you see in our

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.740 
sanitized funnel in here you see in our
soaking<00:03:25.579> solution<00:03:25.969> we've<00:03:26.090> got<00:03:26.209> our<00:03:26.329> scissors

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
soaking solution we've got our scissors

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.259 
soaking solution we've got our scissors
we've<00:03:27.650> got<00:03:27.829> our<00:03:27.949> packet<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.400> yeast<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.879> we've

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
we've got our packet of yeast and we've

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.249 
we've got our packet of yeast and we've
got<00:03:29.449> our<00:03:29.569> foil<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.659> go<00:03:32.659> ahead<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:32.900> kind<00:03:33.199> of

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:33.259 
got our foil so go ahead just kind of

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.600 
got our foil so go ahead just kind of
dry<00:03:33.439> the<00:03:33.500> end<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:33.889> off<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.099> little<00:03:34.220> bit

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.540 

and<00:03:37.080> we're<00:03:38.080> gonna<00:03:38.200> want<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:39.100> cut<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
and we're gonna want to just cut this

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.980 
and we're gonna want to just cut this
again<00:03:39.910> everything<00:03:40.210> you're<00:03:40.360> sterilized<00:03:40.810> this

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
again everything you're sterilized this

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.670 
again everything you're sterilized this
is<00:03:41.140> good

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
is good

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560

I<00:03:41.710> just<00:03:42.460> want<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.730> nip<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.060> corner<00:03:43.390> here<00:03:43.510> a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
I just want to nip the corner here a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.650 
I just want to nip the corner here a
little<00:03:43.690> bit<00:03:43.840> big<00:03:44.530> pressure<00:03:44.800> release<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.660> we

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
little bit big pressure release and we

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.820 
little bit big pressure release and we
didn't<00:03:46.840> want<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.050> drop<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.500> there<00:03:47.590> but

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
didn't want to drop that in there but

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.220 
didn't want to drop that in there but
that's<00:03:47.920> really<00:03:48.190> not<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.370> problem<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.840> now<00:03:49.990> here

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
that's really not a problem so now here

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.820 
that's really not a problem so now here
we<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.470> pour<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:50.950> boy<00:03:51.280> does<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:51.580> stink

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
we just pour it and boy does this stink

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.450 
we just pour it and boy does this stink
and<00:03:53.830> there<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.130> is

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
and there it is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.530 
and there it is
so<00:03:54.550> he<00:03:54.670> goes<00:03:54.850> our<00:03:55.060> yeast<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:58.030> it's<00:03:58.210> gonna<00:03:58.330> be

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
so he goes our yeast and it's gonna be

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.600 
so he goes our yeast and it's gonna be
mixing<00:03:58.960> now<00:03:59.140> with<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.560> sweet<00:03:59.950> wort<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
mixing now with that sweet wort the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.970 
mixing now with that sweet wort the
yeast<00:04:00.850> is<00:04:01.060> gonna<00:04:01.300> start<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.170> replicate<00:04:02.830> and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
yeast is gonna start to replicate and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.680 
yeast is gonna start to replicate and
reproduce<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:03.880> then<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.240> going<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.480> start

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
reproduce and then it's going to start

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.380 
reproduce and then it's going to start
to<00:04:04.870> eat<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.470> give<00:04:06.310> off<00:04:06.490> co2<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.780> alcohol

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
to eat it and give off co2 and alcohol

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
to eat it and give off co2 and alcohol
so<00:04:10.390> take<00:04:11.320> our<00:04:11.470> funnel<00:04:11.770> out<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.070> there<00:04:15.299> let<00:04:16.299> me

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
so take our funnel out of there let me

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.180 
so take our funnel out of there let me
give<00:04:16.540> this<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.720> good<00:04:16.930> little<00:04:17.170> stir<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.920> kind

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
give this a good little stir just kind

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.340 
give this a good little stir just kind
of<00:04:18.250> mix<00:04:18.430> them<00:04:18.489> up<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:18.760> little<00:04:18.850> bit

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.320 

and<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:26.130> we<00:04:26.190> have<00:04:26.400> our<00:04:26.520> sins<00:04:26.760> how<00:04:26.940> spoil

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and now we have our sins how spoil

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.780 
and now we have our sins how spoil
before<00:04:27.750> works<00:04:28.200> fine<00:04:28.500> because<00:04:28.920> there's<00:04:29.700> gonna

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
before works fine because there's gonna

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.100 
before works fine because there's gonna
be<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.970> lot<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.240> pressure<00:04:30.480> here<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.900> doesn't

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
be a lot of pressure here it doesn't

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.420 
be a lot of pressure here it doesn't
even<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.320> airtight<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:31.980> there's<00:04:32.160> gonna<00:04:32.280> be

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
even be airtight to see there's gonna be

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.850 
even be airtight to see there's gonna be
a<00:04:32.460> lot<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:33.630> know<00:04:33.750> chemical<00:04:34.320> reactions

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
a lot of you know chemical reactions

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.470 
a lot of you know chemical reactions
going<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.190> here<00:04:35.370> with<00:04:35.460> giving<00:04:35.760> off<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.970> co2

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
going on here with giving off the co2

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.000 
going on here with giving off the co2
that's<00:04:36.660> gonna<00:04:36.780> be<00:04:36.930> forcing<00:04:37.380> air<00:04:37.500> out<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:37.950> we

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
that's gonna be forcing air out so we

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.860 
that's gonna be forcing air out so we
really<00:04:38.340> can't<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.730> in<00:04:38.910> during<00:04:39.510> this<00:04:39.600> really

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
really can't get in during this really

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.090 
really can't get in during this really
active<00:04:40.230> fermentation<00:04:40.770> we're<00:04:40.860> gonna<00:04:40.950> be

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
active fermentation we're gonna be

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.540 
active fermentation we're gonna be
having<00:04:41.220> going<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.740> let's<00:04:43.800> get<00:04:44.130> this<00:04:44.280> little

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
having going so let's get this little

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.940 
having going so let's get this little
bit<00:04:44.640> dry<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:44.880> then<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.200> kind<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.560> seal<00:04:46.800> it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
bit dry and then we just kind of seal it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.290 
bit dry and then we just kind of seal it
but<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.370> know<00:04:47.460> we<00:04:47.580> don't<00:04:47.730> try<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:47.880> crunch<00:04:48.150> it

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
but you know we don't try to crunch it

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.690 
but you know we don't try to crunch it
too<00:04:48.420> tight<00:04:48.690> because<00:04:48.890> if<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.070> really<00:04:50.460> takes

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
too tight because if this really takes

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.370 
too tight because if this really takes
off<00:04:50.910> we're<00:04:51.120> gonna<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.450> some<00:04:51.690> blow-off<00:04:51.930> which

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
off we're gonna have some blow-off which

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.800 
off we're gonna have some blow-off which
means<00:04:52.620> some<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:54.120> bit<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.300> yeast<00:04:54.450> can<00:04:54.720> be

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
means some a little bit of yeast can be

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.880 
means some a little bit of yeast can be
blown<00:04:55.020> off<00:04:55.140> down<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.410> sides<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.830> everything

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
blown off down the sides and everything

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.500 
blown off down the sides and everything
it's<00:04:56.280> perfectly<00:04:56.670> normal<00:04:56.850> perfectly<00:04:57.180> healthy

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
it's perfectly normal perfectly healthy

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.990 
it's perfectly normal perfectly healthy
but<00:04:58.080> if<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.770> keep<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.280> little<00:04:59.310> bit<00:04:59.610> loose<00:04:59.790> we

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
but if I keep this a little bit loose we

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.120 
but if I keep this a little bit loose we
allow<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.510> happen<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:01.650> now<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.830> best

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
allow that to happen so now the best

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.090 
allow that to happen so now the best
place<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.460> store<00:05:02.880> this<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.330> gonna<00:05:03.570> be<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.110> your
