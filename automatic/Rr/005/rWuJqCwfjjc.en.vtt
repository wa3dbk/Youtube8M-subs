what<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.290> was<00:03:40.470> trying<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:41.130> was<00:03:41.610> just<00:03:41.640> sort<00:03:42.180> of

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
what I was trying to do was just sort of

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.150 
what I was trying to do was just sort of
absorb<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.140> position<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.280> understand<00:03:46.160> where

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
absorb the position and understand where

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.120 
absorb the position and understand where
everything<00:03:47.550> was<00:03:47.670> clustered<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.650> try<00:03:49.650> quickly

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
everything was clustered and try quickly

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.370 
everything was clustered and try quickly
understand<00:03:50.580> what<00:03:50.730> was<00:03:50.850> going<00:03:50.880> on<00:03:51.380> establish

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
understand what was going on establish

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.990 
understand what was going on establish
some<00:03:52.560> logical<00:03:52.980> connections<00:03:53.460> between<00:03:53.640> things

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
some logical connections between things

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.760 
some logical connections between things
and<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.810> important<00:03:55.230> thing<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.560> try<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
and the important thing is to try to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.200 
and the important thing is to try to
make<00:03:55.980> everything<00:03:56.220> make<00:03:56.550> sense<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:58.290> sort<00:03:58.560> of

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
make everything make sense just sort of

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.410 
make everything make sense just sort of
like<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.360> first<00:04:00.630> one<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:01.080> example<00:04:02.180> right<00:04:03.180> so

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
like the first one for example right so

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.460 
like the first one for example right so
this<00:04:03.570> position<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:06.540> still<00:04:06.900> not<00:04:07.050> sure<00:04:07.110> where

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this position I'm still not sure where

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.220 
this position I'm still not sure where
the<00:04:07.560> plunge<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:07.950> think<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.570> I'm<00:04:09.570> not<00:04:09.780> sure<00:04:09.990> where

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the plunge I think I I'm not sure where

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770 
the plunge I think I I'm not sure where
these<00:04:10.350> plans<00:04:10.710> are<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.220> basically<00:04:11.600> we're<00:04:12.600> just

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
these plans are but basically we're just

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.690 
these plans are but basically we're just
sort<00:04:12.960> of<00:04:13.020> like<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.560> mean<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.310> know<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.640> is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
sort of like I mean you know this is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.190 
sort of like I mean you know this is
hitting<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.240> which<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.510> defended<00:04:16.020> by<00:04:16.140> this

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
hitting this which is defended by this

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.260 
hitting this which is defended by this
and<00:04:16.860> you've<00:04:17.100> got<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> pawn<00:04:17.670> structure<00:04:18.030> which

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
and you've got this pawn structure which

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.380 
and you've got this pawn structure which
is<00:04:18.420> very<00:04:18.450> no<00:04:18.840> more<00:04:19.050> than<00:04:19.260> two<00:04:19.410> bishops<00:04:19.590> here

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
is very no more than two bishops here

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.850 
is very no more than two bishops here
this<00:04:21.390> night<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.840> very<00:04:22.020> important<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.740> remember

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
this night is very important to remember

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.940 
this night is very important to remember
and<00:04:23.600> they<00:04:24.600> all<00:04:24.780> just<00:04:24.990> sort<00:04:25.170> of<00:04:25.290> fit<00:04:25.800> together

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
and they all just sort of fit together

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.520 
and they all just sort of fit together
some<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.390> next<00:04:27.690> one<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.140> know<00:04:28.290> which

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
some and the next one you know which

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.430 
some and the next one you know which
looks<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:28.980> this<00:04:29.730> position<00:04:30.300> I'm<00:04:31.140> still<00:04:31.350> not

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
looks like this position I'm still not

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.870 
looks like this position I'm still not
sure<00:04:31.530> where<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:31.890> book<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.340> which<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.640> very

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
sure where this book is which is very

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.580 
sure where this book is which is very
embarrassing<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.690> didn't<00:04:34.410> pay<00:04:34.530> enough

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
embarrassing I didn't pay enough

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.380 
embarrassing I didn't pay enough
attention<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:38.490> know<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.820> can<00:04:39.000> get

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
attention to it but you know you can get

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:47.030 
attention to it but you know you can get
this<00:04:39.840> position<00:04:40.350> right<00:04:45.170> yeah<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.800> would

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
this position right yeah and this would

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.770 
this position right yeah and this would
close<00:04:47.460> right<00:04:47.760> away<00:04:48.000> because<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.540> pawn

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
close right away because the pawn

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.310 
close right away because the pawn
structures<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.170> a

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
structures like this and this is a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.140 
structures like this and this is a
little<00:04:52.620> bit<00:04:52.740> tricky<00:04:53.040> actually<00:04:53.190> because<00:04:53.700> right

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
little bit tricky actually because right

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400 
little bit tricky actually because right
it's<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.390> going<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.690> win<00:04:54.840> by<00:04:54.990> playing<00:04:55.230> Bishop

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it's just going to win by playing Bishop

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.410 
it's just going to win by playing Bishop
a7<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.310> sort<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.550> dominates<00:04:57.060> everything

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
a7 and that sort of dominates everything

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.600 
a7 and that sort of dominates everything
so<00:04:57.930> like<00:04:58.830> that's<00:04:59.040> why<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.220> can't<00:04:59.490> remember

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
so like that's why I can't remember

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.700 
so like that's why I can't remember
where<00:04:59.880> this<00:04:59.970> work<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.360> very<00:05:00.630> well<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.170> the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
where this work is very well because the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.890 
where this work is very well because the
most<00:05:01.890> important<00:05:02.370> things<00:05:02.580> this<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.570> and

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
most important things this and this and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.270 
most important things this and this and
this<00:05:04.110> prime<00:05:04.380> structure<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.100> this<00:05:05.220> is

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
this prime structure and this is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.510 
this prime structure and this is
happening<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:06.060> it's<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.260> hard<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.340> sort

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
happening and it's just hard to to sort

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.730 
happening and it's just hard to to sort
of<00:05:08.610> pay<00:05:08.790> attention<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.420> rep<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.840> sort<00:05:10.680> of

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
of pay attention to the rep you sort of

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.490 
of pay attention to the rep you sort of
get<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.190> by<00:05:11.400> trying<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:12.230> understand<00:05:13.230> what's

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
get it by trying to understand what's

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.560 
get it by trying to understand what's
going<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.920> quickly<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:15.240> course<00:05:15.450> you

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
going on quickly and and of course you

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.540 
going on quickly and and of course you
chunk<00:05:15.840> things<00:05:16.110> right<00:05:16.380> I<00:05:16.410> mean<00:05:16.650> obviously<00:05:16.890> on

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
chunk things right I mean obviously on

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.790 
chunk things right I mean obviously on
these<00:05:18.330> pawns<00:05:18.660> just<00:05:19.530> but<00:05:20.310> but<00:05:20.580> it's<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.300> mean<00:05:21.450> a

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
these pawns just but but it's I mean a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.200 
these pawns just but but it's I mean a
chunk<00:05:22.800> things<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.190> then<00:05:23.310> move<00:05:23.490> away<00:05:23.670> like<00:05:24.060> I

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
chunk things and then move away like I

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.390 
chunk things and then move away like I
mean<00:05:24.420> one<00:05:24.990> person<00:05:25.350> might<00:05:25.530> think<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:26.040> is<00:05:26.220> sort

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
mean one person might think this is sort

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.730 
mean one person might think this is sort
of<00:05:26.490> structured<00:05:27.390> but<00:05:27.570> actually<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.230> would<00:05:28.560> think

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
of structured but actually I would think

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.160 
of structured but actually I would think
this<00:05:28.890> is<00:05:28.950> more<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.730> all<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.390> pawns<00:05:30.630> like<00:05:30.930> this

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
this is more to all the pawns like this

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.059 
this is more to all the pawns like this
and<00:05:31.470> this<00:05:31.710> is<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.950> unit<00:05:32.400> and

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
and this is a unit and

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.100 
and this is a unit and
we<00:05:33.759> just<00:05:33.939> sort<00:05:34.059> of<00:05:34.150> try<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.360> quickly<00:05:34.659> absorb

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
we just sort of try to quickly absorb

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.040 
we just sort of try to quickly absorb
everything<00:05:35.379> but<00:05:35.710> occasionally<00:05:36.689> we<00:05:37.689> miss<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
everything but occasionally we miss the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:46.950 
everything but occasionally we miss the
details<00:05:38.469> which<00:05:38.710> is

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.020
