00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 so hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.690
 video and get yourself a stargate in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.690
 minecraft manila 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.470
 I have that again and yes 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.390
 this stargate works with these 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.340
 lever here so I kill this lever 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.810
 then it will be fully activated and me 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.279
 I'll stargate here on this second one 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.140
 comes out is namely the counterpart 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.290
 and yes then the whole thing sounds first 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.290
 on 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.590
 and we see there already is one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.140
 little bit different and though messi 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.430
 this water and a few particles 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.810
 If I go in now we'll see 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.280
 over there is a sign and here 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.710
 is the console and the way it yes 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 go through the shield here and there 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.680
 over there is the console so I am 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 now came out here in this portal 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 and the whole no guilty yet 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 finish with this emergency stop button 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 then it is very much and i can 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.370
 no longer be imported and how that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 Whole is feasible that shows you now 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 so the whole thing works by me here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 just flip that lever over and through 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.410
 this lever becomes this command 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 out of exactly one block Redstone 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.380
 this place of pont so in this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.310
 well blog this year it will be all over 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 just a few seconds away 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.360
 set so that the whole thing is repeatable 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.790
 and then a Redstone is here was 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 block law exactly at this point and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 this change was a block that connects 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 just this fast cycle with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.770
 this whole command blocks what the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.750
 make up even later 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 Of course, this will also be the point 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 the sound played and this one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 Block arriving blocks here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 just this water in the portal 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 and although it does not water but 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.020
 Just before left and blocks with the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.580
 texture of water and that has that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 advantage I have now normal 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.970
 water is not built that way 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.080
 slow is when you go through here so 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.150
 it takes a bit longer until 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.560
 this is bin and b I have up here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.170
 these depreciations because of the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 flowing water and besides that is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.989
 then we do not sit down 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.679
 feasible because otherwise just gone 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.090
 would flow 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.070
 and that's why I just as 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 Solution such used before left-handed 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.750
 what the disadvantage of it is yes if the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.850
 server is or if your pc is 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890
 then it can be that from time to time 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.769
 fly down so normal fall the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.350
 sand blocks and a bit yes 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.760
 is flawed but if your pc is good 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650
 and on the server then it is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 actually no problem 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.120
 and you can not do that away 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 just been test that too here 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.450
 over there is the whole again the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.770
 Just by this just simply 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.960
 this thing 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.370
 So get rid of all those blocks 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.340
 how do we see it already? 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.430
 To put her there, it's back 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.210
 So I have exactly and in addition 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.290
 still where is it because right here have 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.550
 I of course also made that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.960
 Everything in the circle of a blog 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.420
 here is something in this 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.220
 middle of this portal is in the water 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.780
 is just there to this coordinates there 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 teleported over there, of course 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.990
 can still change 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.460
 yes that was it in the reason of already 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.150
 this little tutorial and this not 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.560
 Ausschaltknopf causes just that here 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.580
 the redstone was away from the third 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.680
 is set so that it no longer 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.250
 everything is visible and b that one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.110
 bley sound is activated so exactly that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.880
 Basically it was already when you the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.140
 map for download already made 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.810
 then write in the comments 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.500
 and so I say to the next 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.500
 times and
