that<00:00:12.630> I'm<00:00:12.719> doing<00:00:12.870> from<00:00:13.110> scratch<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
that I'm doing from scratch this is the

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
that I'm doing from scratch this is the
hairball<00:00:15.389> audio<00:00:15.809> kit<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:17.430> chassis<00:00:17.940> xand

hairball audio kit and a chassis xand

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.400 
hairball audio kit and a chassis xand
main<00:00:18.449> components<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.289> hairball<00:00:19.710> audio

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
main components is from hairball audio

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.380 
main components is from hairball audio
Mouser<00:00:23.390> provides<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> circuitry

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
Mouser provides a lot of the circuitry

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.389 
Mouser provides a lot of the circuitry
resistors<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.939> capacitors<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.470> whatnot<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
resistors and capacitors and whatnot but

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.130 
resistors and capacitors and whatnot but
um<00:00:32.579> yeah<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.090> coming<00:00:33.300> along<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.809> don't<00:00:33.960> have

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
um yeah it's coming along I don't have

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.479 
um yeah it's coming along I don't have
everything<00:00:34.500> hooked<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
everything hooked up I don't have the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.790 
everything hooked up I don't have the
PCB<00:00:36.030> hooked<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.420> yet<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.200> most

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
PCB hooked up yet because I do have most

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.229 
PCB hooked up yet because I do have most
of<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> done<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.520> waiting<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:38.910> two

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of it done but I'm waiting for two

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.319 
of it done but I'm waiting for two
resistors<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> come<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> wait

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
resistors to come in so I have to wait

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.510 
resistors to come in so I have to wait
on<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.660> before<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> connections<00:00:43.770> but

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
on now before I do the connections but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.600 
on now before I do the connections but
right<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.680> main<00:00:46.860> things

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
right now I have most of the main things

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.180 
right now I have most of the main things
connected<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.989> V<00:00:49.140> U<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.710> doing<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
connected the V U and I'm doing the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
connected the V U and I'm doing the
meter<00:00:50.550> board<00:00:50.820> right<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.449> I'm

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
meter board right now so right now I'm

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
meter board right now so right now I'm
actually<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> test<00:00:55.699> continuity

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
actually going to test continuity

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.260 
actually going to test continuity
between<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.840> chassis<00:00:58.320> points<00:00:59.239> because<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
between the chassis points because of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
between the chassis points because of
chassis<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.260> acts<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.340> ground<00:01:02.699> shield

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
chassis actually acts as a ground shield

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
chassis actually acts as a ground shield
so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.960> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.769> everything

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so you want to make sure that everything

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.980 
so you want to make sure that everything
is<00:01:05.610> connected<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:08.100> circuit<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.840> my

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is connected as one circuit so I have my

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
is connected as one circuit so I have my
multimeter<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.250> probe

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
multimeter here and I have one probe

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
multimeter here and I have one probe
into<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.150> side<00:01:12.420> I'm<00:01:12.630> gonna<00:01:12.780> check<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
into one side I'm gonna check if the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
into one side I'm gonna check if the
connection<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> complete<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> other<00:01:15.659> side

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
connection is complete to the other side

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
connection is complete to the other side
here<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.439> let's<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.400> other<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> our

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
here so let's get our other side of our

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.300 
here so let's get our other side of our
probe<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.159> no

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
probe here right now there's no

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
probe here right now there's no
connection<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:21.030> there's<00:01:21.299> no<00:01:21.479> no<00:01:21.900> connection

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
connection one there's no no connection

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.609 
connection one there's no no connection
and<00:01:23.189> we'll<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.610> our<00:01:23.759> probe<00:01:24.060> into<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and we'll put our probe into here and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.870 
and we'll put our probe into here and
bingo<00:01:26.659> connection<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bingo connection so this side of the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.530 
bingo connection so this side of the
chassis<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.540> connected<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.439> point<00:01:32.540> just

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
chassis is connected to this point just

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.609 
chassis is connected to this point just
for<00:01:33.689> sake<00:01:33.900> let's<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:36.119> probably

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
for sake let's do the back it's probably

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.370 
for sake let's do the back it's probably
connected<00:01:37.619> yeah<00:01:38.460> perfect<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.900> let's<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
connected yeah perfect and let's do the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
connected yeah perfect and let's do the
frets<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.369> find<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.790> connection<00:01:42.270> point

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
frets so when we find a connection point

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.080 
frets so when we find a connection point
here<00:01:43.700> there's<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:45.000> connection<00:01:45.360> points

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
here there's a little connection points

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
here there's a little connection points
mmm<00:01:48.149> bingo<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> circuit<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
mmm bingo we have a circuit so the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.990 
mmm bingo we have a circuit so the
chassis<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.420> complete<00:01:52.460> acts<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> shield

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
chassis is complete acts as a shield

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
chassis is complete acts as a shield
ground<00:01:54.509> shield<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.259> there's<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.829> ground

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
ground shield and there's some ground

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
ground shield and there's some ground
components<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.090> need<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
components that you need to go into the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.959 
components that you need to go into the
chassis<00:01:59.040> uses<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.750> instance<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> XLR<00:02:01.969> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
chassis uses so for instance the XLR you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
chassis uses so for instance the XLR you
need<00:02:03.119> grounds<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.860> ground<00:02:05.130> pin<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:06.680> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
need grounds the ground pin here you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.110 
need grounds the ground pin here you
need<00:02:08.119> actually<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:10.730> n1

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
need actually to have n1

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
need actually to have n1
I'm<00:02:13.270> grounded<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.680> chassis<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> have

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
I'm grounded into the chassis so I have

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.690 
I'm grounded into the chassis so I have
a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:16.000> wire<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:17.290> from<00:02:17.410> pin<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.160> it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
a little wire going from pin and it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.800 
a little wire going from pin and it's
grounding<00:02:19.150> into<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.480> XLR<00:02:20.290> itself<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:22.420> have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
grounding into the XLR itself and I have

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.140 
grounding into the XLR itself and I have
some<00:02:23.110> bolts<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.640> scraped<00:02:24.940> off<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
some bolts here and I scraped off the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.940 
some bolts here and I scraped off the
powder<00:02:25.450> coat<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> chassis<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.440> make<00:02:26.800> sure

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
powder coat to the chassis so make sure

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.300 
powder coat to the chassis so make sure
that<00:02:27.099> this<00:02:27.370> connection<00:02:27.700> goes<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:28.360> into<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that this connection goes right into the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.720 
that this connection goes right into the
chassis<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.269> XLR<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.110> XLR<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
chassis to this XLR so this XLR is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.339 
chassis to this XLR so this XLR is
tapped<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.209> grounded<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.959> chesties

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
tapped in and grounded into the chesties

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.860 
tapped in and grounded into the chesties
here<00:02:35.560> same<00:02:35.950> thing<00:02:35.980> with<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> input<00:02:36.870> grounded

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
here same thing with the input grounded

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.390 
here same thing with the input grounded
in<00:02:38.019> pin<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.220> again<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:40.599> grounded<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.400> XLR

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
in pin one again is grounded to the XLR

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.490 
in pin one again is grounded to the XLR
into<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.970> chassis<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.230> one

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
into the chassis so you have one

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.100 
into the chassis so you have one
complete<00:02:44.890> ground<00:02:45.220> connection<00:02:45.700> going<00:02:46.110> good

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
complete ground connection going good

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.289 
complete ground connection going good
and<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.010> input<00:02:48.400> transformer<00:02:48.940> also<00:02:49.239> you

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
and then the input transformer also you

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.650 
and then the input transformer also you
need<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.799> yeah<00:02:50.799> this<00:02:51.010> grounded<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.819> scraped

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
need it yeah this grounded I scraped

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.390 
need it yeah this grounded I scraped
powder<00:02:52.900> coat<00:02:53.230> off<00:02:53.500> as<00:02:53.920> well<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
powder coat off as well and so this is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.190 
powder coat off as well and so this is
grounded<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.390> chancy's<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.140> you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
grounded and to the chancy's and you

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.960 
grounded and to the chancy's and you
have<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.319> complete<00:02:59.680> ground<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> input

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
have a complete ground for the input

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.520 
have a complete ground for the input
transformer<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:03.180> there's<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.450> input<00:03:04.989> itself

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
transformer and there's the input itself

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.420 
transformer and there's the input itself
you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.250> put<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> knob<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.980> control<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
you can put a knob and you control it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.449 
you can put a knob and you control it
here<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.640> don't<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.030> knob<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.239> yet<00:03:10.569> but

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
here I don't have the knob on yet but

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.710 
here I don't have the knob on yet but
you<00:03:12.459> have<00:03:12.580> your<00:03:12.700> inputs<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.180> outputs<00:03:13.569> going

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
you have your inputs and outputs going

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.340 
you have your inputs and outputs going
into<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.690> runs<00:03:16.900> right<00:03:17.140> into

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
into here and then it runs right into

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.590 
into here and then it runs right into
the<00:03:17.560> input<00:03:17.829> transformer<00:03:18.400> then<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.329> will<00:03:19.450> power

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
the input transformer then it will power

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.930 
the input transformer then it will power
into<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.140> PCB<00:03:20.650> which<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:20.950> not<00:03:21.130> here<00:03:21.340> yet<00:03:21.549> I'll

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
into the PCB which is not here yet I'll

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.240 
into the PCB which is not here yet I'll
go<00:03:22.120> right<00:03:22.329> into<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.750> PCB<00:03:23.230> with<00:03:24.040> all<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
go right into the PCB with all the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.490 
go right into the PCB with all the
circuitry<00:03:24.670> um<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:26.079> meter<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.660> has<00:03:29.319> an

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
circuitry um the meter is so it has an

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.460 
circuitry um the meter is so it has an
off<00:03:29.620> switch<00:03:30.540> that's<00:03:31.540> where<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.840> power<00:03:32.019> that

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
off switch that's where the power that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.400 
off switch that's where the power that
the<00:03:32.590> meter<00:03:32.769> actually<00:03:33.329> would<00:03:34.329> go<00:03:34.480> riding<00:03:34.900> here

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
the meter actually would go riding here

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.440 
the meter actually would go riding here
perfect<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:38.200> would<00:03:38.850> turn<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:39.970> off<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.329> on

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
perfect so you would turn it off and on

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.860 
perfect so you would turn it off and on
right<00:03:40.690> here<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.690> switch<00:03:43.690> and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
right here with the switch and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.850 
right here with the switch and
I<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.739> connector<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.580> power<00:03:47.819> outlet

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
I have that connector to be power outlet

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.520 
I have that connector to be power outlet
you<00:03:49.860> can<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.610> power<00:03:50.790> outlet<00:03:51.060> right<00:03:51.390> here

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
you can see the power outlet right here

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.990 
you can see the power outlet right here
where<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.590> put<00:03:52.769> your<00:03:52.920> power<00:03:53.159> cord<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.909> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
where you put your power cord in to the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.089 
where you put your power cord in to the
wall<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:56.299> another<00:03:57.299> ground<00:03:57.890> important<00:03:58.890> ground

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
wall and another ground important ground

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.500 
wall and another ground important ground
for<00:03:59.489> your<00:03:59.580> power<00:03:59.879> is<00:04:00.769> your<00:04:01.769> ground<00:04:01.950> pin<00:04:02.510> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
for your power is your ground pin and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.100 
for your power is your ground pin and
that's<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.079> your<00:04:04.400> number<00:04:05.400> three<00:04:05.900> ground<00:04:06.900> pin

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
that's in your number three ground pin

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.319 
that's in your number three ground pin
here<00:04:07.909> there<00:04:08.909> you<00:04:08.970> go

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
here there you go

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.160 
here there you go
and<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:11.760> rounds<00:04:12.239> into<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.450> chassis<00:04:12.989> and

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
and that rounds into the chassis and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.720 
and that rounds into the chassis and
that's<00:04:13.349> for<00:04:13.500> safety<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.129> don't<00:04:14.459> want<00:04:14.579> anyone

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that's for safety you don't want anyone

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.960 
that's for safety you don't want anyone
getting<00:04:14.940> shocked<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.709> your<00:04:16.979> ground<00:04:17.220> pin<00:04:17.519> comes

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
getting shocked so your ground pin comes

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.640 
getting shocked so your ground pin comes
off<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.919> going<00:04:20.250> into<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.549> bolt<00:04:20.910> in

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
off and I have that going into a bolt in

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.140 
off and I have that going into a bolt in
the<00:04:22.650> chassis<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.220> scraped<00:04:23.669> powder<00:04:23.850> coat<00:04:24.120> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
the chassis I scraped powder coat and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.879 
the chassis I scraped powder coat and
this<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.660> grounded<00:04:25.020> right<00:04:25.199> into<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.500> chassis

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
this is grounded right into the chassis

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.850 
this is grounded right into the chassis
so<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.130> have<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.340> complete<00:04:26.550> ground<00:04:27.210> again<00:04:27.860> and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
so you have a complete ground again and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.460 
so you have a complete ground again and
your<00:04:29.240> negative<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.360> positive<00:04:30.870> your<00:04:31.110> hot<00:04:31.580> wire

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
your negative and positive your hot wire

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.879 
your negative and positive your hot wire
comes<00:04:34.470> out<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:36.110> goes<00:04:37.110> into<00:04:37.500> your<00:04:38.250> PCB<00:04:38.729> switch

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
comes out and goes into your PCB switch

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.790 
comes out and goes into your PCB switch
for<00:04:40.889> your<00:04:41.010> on<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.310> off<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.110> this<00:04:43.110> power<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.680> on

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
for your on and off and this power is on

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.640 
for your on and off and this power is on
enough<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.280> unit<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:46.080> that<00:04:46.260> going

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
enough the unit so you have that going

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.480 
enough the unit so you have that going
in<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:46.979> negative<00:04:47.340> positive<00:04:47.960> goes<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.110> here

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
in your negative positive goes in here

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.690 
in your negative positive goes in here
and<00:04:50.490> then<00:04:51.800> you're<00:04:52.800> out<00:04:53.479> goes<00:04:54.479> into<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> power

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
and then you're out goes into the power

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.270 
and then you're out goes into the power
transformer<00:04:56.700> does<00:04:57.450> its<00:04:57.680> conversions<00:04:58.680> for<00:04:59.190> the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
transformer does its conversions for the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.980 
transformer does its conversions for the
power<00:04:59.490> and<00:05:00.110> then<00:05:01.110> goes<00:05:01.320> out<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:03.210> these<00:05:03.450> which

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
power and then goes out to these which

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.659 
power and then goes out to these which
goes<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:04.440> PCB<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:04.919> then<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.250> powers<00:05:05.550> all

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
goes to the PCB and then it powers all

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.870 
goes to the PCB and then it powers all
your<00:05:05.849> components<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:07.470> get<00:05:07.650> power<00:05:07.889> and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
your components and you get power and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.400 
your components and you get power and
you<00:05:09.120> want<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> make<00:05:09.510> sure<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.080> is<00:05:10.260> your

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
you want to make sure that this is your

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.990 
you want to make sure that this is your
most<00:05:10.560> important<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.820> get<00:05:11.940> your

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
most important that you get your

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.430 
most important that you get your
connections<00:05:12.570> correct<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.020> get<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.260> right

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
connections correct you get the right

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.070 
connections correct you get the right
power<00:05:13.680> transformer<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.639> can<00:05:14.820> just

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
power transformer because you can just

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.430 
power transformer because you can just
hang<00:05:16.080> your<00:05:16.229> whole<00:05:16.470> project<00:05:16.830> here<00:05:17.449> and<00:05:18.449> solve

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
hang your whole project here and solve

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.020 
hang your whole project here and solve
that<00:05:19.620> connected<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.250> have<00:05:20.340> your<00:05:20.490> ratio<00:05:20.970> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
that connected you have your ratio I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.779 
that connected you have your ratio I
have<00:05:21.330> no<00:05:21.840> ratio<00:05:22.229> connected<00:05:22.770> yet<00:05:22.949> I'm<00:05:23.490> waiting

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
have no ratio connected yet I'm waiting

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.120 
have no ratio connected yet I'm waiting
for<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.970> PCB<00:05:24.419> to<00:05:24.570> be<00:05:24.690> installed<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.889> we'll<00:05:25.979> go

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
for the PCB to be installed and we'll go

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.240 
for the PCB to be installed and we'll go
off<00:05:26.250> into<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.610> PCB<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.210> everything<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:29.130> it's

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
off into the PCB and everything so it's

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.390 
off into the PCB and everything so it's
coming<00:05:29.520> along<00:05:30.680> just<00:05:31.680> making<00:05:31.949> sure<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.130> have<00:05:32.280> all

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
coming along just making sure I have all

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.180 
coming along just making sure I have all
the<00:05:32.520> sick<00:05:32.699> of<00:05:32.820> cheese<00:05:32.970> rights<00:05:34.190> connections

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
the sick of cheese rights connections

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.320 
the sick of cheese rights connections
and<00:05:36.289> we're<00:05:37.289> getting<00:05:37.380> there<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:37.949> this<00:05:38.940> is<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.180> day

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
and we're getting there so this is a day

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.839 
and we're getting there so this is a day
two<00:05:39.389> of<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.810> build<00:05:39.990> on<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.010> limited<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.580> I'm

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
two of the build on the limited time I'm

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.600 
two of the build on the limited time I'm
doing<00:05:42.060> this<00:05:42.150> for<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.780> client<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.979> hopefully

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
doing this for a client and hopefully

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.600 
doing this for a client and hopefully
day<00:05:44.820> three<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.210> can<00:05:45.510> at<00:05:45.630> least<00:05:45.660> get<00:05:46.050> in<00:05:46.199> some<00:05:47.130> PCB

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
day three I can at least get in some PCB

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.589 
day three I can at least get in some PCB
stuff<00:05:48.470> power<00:05:49.470> connections<00:05:50.099> and<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:51.210> ratio

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
stuff power connections and the ratio

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.880 
stuff power connections and the ratio
and<00:05:51.900> then<00:05:52.740> we'll<00:05:52.830> get<00:05:52.919> on<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.220> attack<00:05:53.580> and

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
and then we'll get on to attack and

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970 
and then we'll get on to attack and
release<00:05:55.890> knobs<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:57.020> getting<00:05:58.020> there

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
release knobs so getting there

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.910 
release knobs so getting there
see<00:05:59.550> you<00:05:59.670> in<00:05:59.730> a<00:05:59.820> bit
