all<00:00:07.770> right<00:00:07.950> what<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.250> need<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> talk<00:00:08.610> about<00:00:08.639> is

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
all right what we need to talk about is

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:18.920 
all right what we need to talk about is
going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.750> be<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.469> trigger<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:17.640> overstate<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
going to be the trigger to overstate the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
going to be the trigger to overstate the
importance<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> trigger<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.010> probably<00:00:20.460> not

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
importance of trigger is probably not

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 
importance of trigger is probably not
possible<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> understand<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.859> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
possible you have to understand it is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
possible you have to understand it is
the<00:00:23.189> last<00:00:23.430> human<00:00:24.210> input<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> give<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the last human input that you give to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.470 
the last human input that you give to
the<00:00:25.740> weapon<00:00:26.099> system<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.670> order<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> cause<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the weapon system in order to cause it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.020 
the weapon system in order to cause it
to<00:00:27.510> begin<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> fire

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.130 

we<00:00:33.030> always<00:00:33.210> hear<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> people<00:00:33.960> talking

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
we always hear a lot of people talking

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.270 
we always hear a lot of people talking
about<00:00:34.410> coming<00:00:34.680> straight<00:00:34.890> back<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
about coming straight back on the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
about coming straight back on the
trigger<00:00:35.550> straight<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> trigger

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
trigger straight back on the trigger

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080 
trigger straight back on the trigger
well<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.950> reason<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.059> because

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
well the the reason for this is because

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
well the the reason for this is because
if<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.110> remember<00:00:40.500> back<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.890> third<00:00:41.100> grade

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
if you remember back to your third grade

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
if you remember back to your third grade
science<00:00:41.550> class<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.780> remember<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
science class what you would remember is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
science class what you would remember is
those<00:00:43.800> tuning<00:00:44.489> forks<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.030> has<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> little

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
those tuning forks that has a little

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.389 
those tuning forks that has a little
handle<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:47.070> pieces<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
handle on it and then two pieces of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.560 
handle on it and then two pieces of
metal<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.789> come<00:00:47.969> around<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.329> little

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
metal that come around with little

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.790 
metal that come around with little
weights<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> end<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> tap<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> against

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
weights on the end you tap it against

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
weights on the end you tap it against
something<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> begins<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> vibrate<00:00:50.930> if

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
something and it begins to vibrate if

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
something and it begins to vibrate if
you<00:00:52.140> remember<00:00:52.469> correctly<00:00:52.829> whenever<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> went

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you remember correctly whenever you went

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
you remember correctly whenever you went
while<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.120> vibrating<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.020> touch

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
while it was vibrating and you touch

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020 
while it was vibrating and you touch
something<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.129> would<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.489> move<00:00:56.910> away

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
something it would actually move away

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.910 
something it would actually move away
from<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> touched<00:00:57.960> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> bounce<00:00:58.680> off

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
from what you touched kind of bounce off

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
from what you touched kind of bounce off
of<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> well<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.180> same<00:01:00.390> thing<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of it well the same thing is going on

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
of it well the same thing is going on
with<00:01:01.199> these<00:01:01.350> guns<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> running<00:01:02.489> these

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
with these guns so running these

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
with these guns so running these
triggers<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.960> doesn't<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
triggers right really doesn't have a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
triggers right really doesn't have a
whole<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:04.949> shooting<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
whole lot to do with shooting so we just

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.830 
whole lot to do with shooting so we just
want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.330> sure<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.720> have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
want to make sure that we have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
want to make sure that we have
everything<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> right<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.880> gun

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
everything going the right way the gun

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
everything going the right way the gun
begins<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> vibrate<00:01:16.110> whenever<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> fires

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
begins to vibrate whenever it fires

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.830 
begins to vibrate whenever it fires
there's<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.430> explosion<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:18.090> inside<00:01:18.570> there

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
there's an explosion going inside there

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
there's an explosion going inside there
lots<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> pressure<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:20.070> sorts<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> violence

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
lots of pressure all sorts of violence

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
lots of pressure all sorts of violence
going<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.240> inside<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.040> gun<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
going on inside so if the gun is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
going on inside so if the gun is
vibrating<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.630> trigger<00:01:24.960> gets<00:01:25.619> pushed

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
vibrating and the trigger gets pushed

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
vibrating and the trigger gets pushed
right<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.820> left<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> cause

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
right or left then it's going to cause

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.550 
right or left then it's going to cause
the<00:01:29.310> barrel<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.720> left<00:01:30.750> pretty

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the barrel to go right or left pretty

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.810 
the barrel to go right or left pretty
much<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> opposite<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.610> you're

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
much the opposite of the way you're

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
much the opposite of the way you're
pulling<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.110> you'll<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> trigger

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
pulling so if you'll look at the trigger

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
pulling so if you'll look at the trigger
this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> standard<00:01:36.119> aw<00:01:36.540> trigger<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this is a standard aw trigger and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
this is a standard aw trigger and
without<00:01:37.470> moving<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.070> mechanism<00:01:38.610> right<00:01:38.729> there

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
without moving the mechanism right there

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
without moving the mechanism right there
you'll<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> trigger<00:01:39.810> actually

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you'll see that the trigger actually

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
you'll see that the trigger actually
moves<00:01:40.590> between<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.130> raceways<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.479> other

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
moves between the raceways in other

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
moves between the raceways in other
words<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.470> mechanism<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> trigger<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
words the mechanism of the trigger is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
words the mechanism of the trigger is
between<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.180> two<00:01:45.240> steel<00:01:45.780> plates<00:01:46.229> these

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
between these two steel plates these

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
between these two steel plates these
steel<00:01:46.770> plates<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.220> inserted<00:01:47.610> into<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> gun

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
steel plates are inserted into the gun

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.960 
steel plates are inserted into the gun
locked<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.250> movement<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
locked in but the movement of the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.230 
locked in but the movement of the
trigger<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.680> bound<00:01:52.680> inside<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.909> plates

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
trigger is bound inside these two plates

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
trigger is bound inside these two plates
that's<00:01:54.689> why<00:01:54.930> whenever<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.950> come<00:01:56.159> straight

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's why whenever you come straight
