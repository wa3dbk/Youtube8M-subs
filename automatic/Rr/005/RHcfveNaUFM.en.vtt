00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that because it's a lot easier than

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
that because it's a lot easier than
trying<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> hold<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.710> did<00:01:31.860> the

really know what those things are but

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.100 
really know what those things are but
you<00:02:15.510> learn<00:02:15.720> until<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.110> they'll<00:02:16.200> kill<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.530> um

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you learn until then they'll kill you um

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.960 
you learn until then they'll kill you um
if<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.530> get<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> speed<00:02:21.440> I'm<00:02:22.490> try<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.820> it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
if you get the speed I'm try to get it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
if you get the speed I'm try to get it
maybe<00:02:24.540> it'll<00:02:24.780> come<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:24.990> if<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.770> get<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> speed

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
maybe it'll come up if you get the speed

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.210 
maybe it'll come up if you get the speed
you<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.630> will<00:02:27.870> stay<00:02:28.230> running<00:02:28.740> it'll<00:02:29.190> never

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you got will stay running it'll never

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.300 
you got will stay running it'll never
wear<00:02:29.670> off<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.190> going

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
wear off and as you can see it's going

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.720 
wear off and as you can see it's going
up<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.610> slow<00:02:32.880> because<00:02:33.090> i<00:02:33.240> can't<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.570> coins<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
up so slow because i can't get coins so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.699 
up so slow because i can't get coins so
it's<00:02:35.880> probably<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.300> take<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:37.640> think<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
it's probably going to take I think I I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's probably going to take I think I I
did<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> math<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.370> about<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.000> get

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
did the math and it's about you get

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660 
did the math and it's about you get
about<00:02:42.270> 2<00:02:42.480> million<00:02:42.780> points<00:02:43.020> every<00:02:43.410> hour<00:02:43.670> so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
about 2 million points every hour so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.060 
about 2 million points every hour so
without<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.660> speed<00:02:45.990> with<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> speed<00:02:46.890> you'll

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
without the speed with the speed you'll

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.840 
without the speed with the speed you'll
probably<00:02:47.250> get<00:02:47.430> about<00:02:48.260> 20<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.770> 30<00:02:50.040> million<00:02:50.459> an

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
probably get about 20 to 30 million an

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.520 
probably get about 20 to 30 million an
hour<00:02:52.580> um<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.640> only<00:02:56.970> thing<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> haven't

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
hour um the only thing that I haven't

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.500 
hour um the only thing that I haven't
figured<00:02:58.830> out<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.280> how<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.520> end<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.940> game<00:02:59.970> I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
figured out is how to end the game I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.940 
figured out is how to end the game I
know<00:03:01.110> once<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.100> speed<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.410> can't<00:03:04.709> kill

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
know once you get speed you can't kill

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.280 
know once you get speed you can't kill
yourself<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.420> makes<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.780> impossible<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
yourself is it makes it impossible to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.960 
yourself is it makes it impossible to
kill<00:03:07.500> yourself<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.160> can't<00:03:08.430> kill<00:03:08.580> yourself

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
kill yourself so you can't kill yourself

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.750 
kill yourself so you can't kill yourself
if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.959> get<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> speed<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.310> can<00:03:11.459> run<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
if you get the speed like you can run to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.800 
if you get the speed like you can run to
the<00:03:11.850> wall<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.270> won't<00:03:12.420> do<00:03:12.570> anything

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
the wall and it won't do anything

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
the wall and it won't do anything
because<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> thinks<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.130> still<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.580> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
because it thinks that you still have it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.860 
because it thinks that you still have it
um<00:03:16.310> but<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.510> run<00:03:18.630> into<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
um but now you know I can run into the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.009 
um but now you know I can run into the
wall<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:20.360> I'm<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.540> ahead<00:03:21.690> kill<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:23.989> it'll<00:03:24.989> just

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
wall and I'm go ahead kill so it'll just

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.940 
wall and I'm go ahead kill so it'll just
reset<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.980> say<00:03:26.310> try<00:03:26.549> again<00:03:26.820> restart<00:03:27.950> let's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
reset you say try again restart let's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.039 
reset you say try again restart let's
see<00:03:29.070> if<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.459> again<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.840> all<00:03:30.989> you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
want to do is just just swipe to Tom's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.509 
want to do is just just swipe to Tom's
just<00:03:35.630> once<00:03:36.630> twice<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.890> turn<00:03:38.130> that's<00:03:38.400> all

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
just once twice on the turn that's all

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.400 
just once twice on the turn that's all
you<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.880> do<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.630> pretty<00:03:39.900> easy<00:03:40.080> you'll

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.020 
you got to do it's pretty easy you'll
get<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> hang<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.100> after<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.400> while<00:03:41.459> but

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
get the hang of it after a while but

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.870 
get the hang of it after a while but
just<00:03:42.930> set<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.200> down<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:44.190> set<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.519> down<00:03:44.640> like

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that and then just swipe swipe I've seen

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.110 
that and then just swipe swipe I've seen
videos<00:03:49.650> where<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.070> swipe<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.549> one<00:03:50.820> way<00:03:50.970> this

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
videos where you swipe it one way this

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.539 
videos where you swipe it one way this
way<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:51.510> bad<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> other<00:03:51.989> way<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.430> can

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
way then bad the other way but you can

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.970 
way then bad the other way but you can
just<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> same<00:03:54.180> way<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.680> that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
just do it the same way just like that

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:05.240 
just do it the same way just like that
and<00:03:56.360> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.690> it<00:04:01.370> I'm<00:04:02.370> gonna<00:04:02.489> see<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:04.250> see

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
and you can get it I'm gonna see if see

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.390 
and you can get it I'm gonna see if see
if<00:04:05.280> i<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.580> get<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:06.680> Appert<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.920> come<00:04:08.130> or

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
if i can get a Appert to come or

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.980 
if i can get a Appert to come or
something

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.900 

I<00:04:14.370> guess<00:04:15.370> not<00:04:15.550> I'm<00:04:15.970> doing<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.330> more<00:04:16.360> time<00:04:17.910> to

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
I guess not I'm doing one more time to

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.830 
I guess not I'm doing one more time to
show<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.690> how<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.840> do<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:21.210> maybe<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.330> can<00:04:22.570> do<00:04:22.690> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
show you how to do it maybe I can do it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:34.200 
show you how to do it maybe I can do it
I<00:04:25.590> think<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.740> about<00:04:26.980> timing<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:33.210> thinking

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
I think it's about timing to thinking

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.070 
I think it's about timing to thinking

options tutorial off that play I'm going
to<00:05:10.260> do<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.650> with<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.310> swirl<00:05:11.669> off<00:05:17.360> they<00:05:18.360> say

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
to do it with the swirl off they say

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.629 
to do it with the swirl off they say
don't<00:05:18.750> work<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:21.150> come<00:05:21.389> across<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.870> term

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.070 

that<00:05:26.639> would<00:05:26.820> be<00:05:26.970> pretty<00:05:27.150> cool<00:05:27.270> if<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.690> did<00:05:27.750> work

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
that would be pretty cool if it did work

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.120 
that would be pretty cool if it did work
because<00:05:28.770> it'd<00:05:28.979> be<00:05:29.130> real<00:05:29.340> easy<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:31.130> mean<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.280> get
