this is all really interesting

of the benefits of this is that by

of the benefits of this is that by

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
abundances to increase this should mean

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.000 
abundances to increase this should mean
more<00:03:18.820> predation<00:03:19.480> pressure<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:20.019> sea<00:03:20.440> urchins

more predation pressure on sea urchins

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
more predation pressure on sea urchins
which<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.400> turn<00:03:21.640> will<00:03:21.940> allow<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.269> reefs<00:03:22.630> to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
which in turn will allow the reefs to

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.080 
which in turn will allow the reefs to
return<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.500> more<00:03:23.560> natural<00:03:24.190> state

return to a more natural state
so<00:03:27.090> far<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.720> data<00:03:27.900> seems<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.349> indicate<00:03:28.620> that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
so far the data seems to indicate that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.949 
so far the data seems to indicate that
there's<00:03:29.250> quite<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:29.970> variability<00:03:30.390> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
there's quite a bit of variability in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.660 
there's quite a bit of variability in
both<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.410> abundance<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.160> all<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.489> these
