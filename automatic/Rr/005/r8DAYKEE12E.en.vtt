to spend a few moments here having a
look<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:21.020> see<00:00:21.079> what<00:00:21.259> it<00:00:21.349> actually<00:00:21.470> means<00:00:23.259> now

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
look to see what it actually means now

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
imagine you're out camping in your tents

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.829 
imagine you're out camping in your tents
and<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:28.039> clouds<00:00:28.279> come<00:00:28.490> over<00:00:28.820> panic<00:00:29.420> starts<00:00:29.720> to

well<00:00:31.519> hydrostatic<00:00:32.449> head<00:00:32.720> is<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.379> measure<00:00:33.650> of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
well hydrostatic head is the measure of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.970 
well hydrostatic head is the measure of
how<00:00:34.400> waterproof<00:00:35.390> your<00:00:35.809> temperature<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:36.650> and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
how waterproof your temperature is and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.970 
how waterproof your temperature is and
the<00:00:37.699> more<00:00:37.820> waterproof<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.440> dry<00:00:39.680> your

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
the more waterproof it is the dry your

the more waterproof it is the dry your
be<00:00:43.360> now<00:00:44.360> let's<00:00:44.690> look<00:00:44.839> into<00:00:45.049> the<00:00:45.409> details<00:00:45.799> of

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
be now let's look into the details of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.789 
be now let's look into the details of
what<00:00:46.129> hydrostatic<00:00:47.030> head<00:00:47.210> actually<00:00:47.420> is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
what hydrostatic head actually is

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.770 
what hydrostatic head actually is
imagine<00:00:48.799> we've<00:00:49.100> got<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.519> piece<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.239> temp

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
imagine we've got a piece of temp

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.549 
imagine we've got a piece of temp
material<00:00:51.229> and<00:00:51.850> on<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.059> tip<00:00:53.390> material<00:00:53.869> we

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
material and on that tip material we

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.560 
material and on that tip material we
place<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.250> large<00:00:55.640> tube<00:00:56.409> on<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.530> tube<00:00:58.269> we<00:00:59.269> mark

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
place a large tube on the tube we mark

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.250 
place a large tube on the tube we mark
out<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.930> scale<00:01:00.229> say<00:01:00.830> millimeters<00:01:02.049> we<00:01:03.049> then

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
out a scale say millimeters we then

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.140 
out a scale say millimeters we then
start<00:01:03.589> pouring<00:01:04.040> water<00:01:04.449> into<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.630> tube<00:01:07.150> we

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
start pouring water into that tube we

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.870 
start pouring water into that tube we
pour<00:01:08.420> more<00:01:08.630> water<00:01:08.659> build<00:01:09.650> up<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:10.009> larger<00:01:10.549> column

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
pour more water build up a larger column

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.280 
pour more water build up a larger column
of<00:01:11.000> water<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.560> we<00:01:12.800> keep<00:01:13.040> going<00:01:13.280> until<00:01:14.290> we

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
of water and we keep going until we

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.950 
of water and we keep going until we
start<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.800> see<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.460> fabric<00:01:16.750> leaking<00:01:17.750> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
start to see the fabric leaking and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.340 
start to see the fabric leaking and
letting<00:01:18.230> some<00:01:18.380> water<00:01:18.560> through<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:21.140> will

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
letting some water through this will

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.860 
letting some water through this will
give<00:01:21.560> us<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:22.030> hydrostatic<00:01:23.030> head<00:01:23.300> so

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
give us the hydrostatic head so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.210 
give us the hydrostatic head so
hydrostatic<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.920> how<00:01:25.610> much<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.620> column<00:01:28.190> of

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
hydrostatic is how much of a column of

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.760 
hydrostatic is how much of a column of
water<00:01:28.520> could<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.510> fabric<00:01:29.900> hold<00:01:30.140> before<00:01:30.680> it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
water could the fabric hold before it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.990 
water could the fabric hold before it
starts<00:01:31.100> leaking<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.780> our<00:01:32.780> example<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.430> started

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
starts leaking in our example it started

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.030 
starts leaking in our example it started
leaking<00:01:35.150> after<00:01:35.450> five<00:01:35.900> thousand<00:01:36.440> millimeters

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
leaking after five thousand millimeters

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.790 
leaking after five thousand millimeters
so<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.280> say<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.000> fabric<00:01:38.630> has<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:39.260> hydrostatic

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
so we say this fabric has a hydrostatic

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.070 
so we say this fabric has a hydrostatic
head<00:01:40.250> for<00:01:40.790> five<00:01:41.030> thousand<00:01:41.420> millimeters<00:01:41.930> and

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
head for five thousand millimeters and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.280 
head for five thousand millimeters and
you'll<00:01:42.680> also<00:01:42.890> see<00:01:43.370> that<00:01:43.930> abbreviated<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.050> some

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
you'll also see that abbreviated on some

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.060 
you'll also see that abbreviated on some
tents<00:01:45.560> as<00:01:45.860> 8h

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.590 

so<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:50.640> thinking<00:01:50.940> that's<00:01:51.150> all<00:01:51.300> well

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
so you're very thinking that's all well

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.770 
so you're very thinking that's all well
and<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> good<00:01:53.580> hydrostatic<00:01:54.390> head

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and good what is a good hydrostatic head

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.090 
and good what is a good hydrostatic head
that<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.470> need<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.950> my<00:01:56.010> tent<00:01:57.290> well<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.680> larger

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that I need for my tent well the larger

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.680 
that I need for my tent well the larger
the<00:01:59.190> number<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.880> more<00:02:00.060> waterproof<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
the number the more waterproof the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.660 
the number the more waterproof the
material<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.620> would<00:02:01.740> seem<00:02:01.950> obvious<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.460> say

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
material so it would seem obvious to say

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
material so it would seem obvious to say
I'm<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.300> find<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.840> tent<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> largest

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I'm gonna find a tent with the largest

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'm gonna find a tent with the largest
hydrostatic<00:02:05.880> head<00:02:07.130> unfortunately<00:02:08.130> it's<00:02:08.369> not

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
hydrostatic head unfortunately it's not

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.340 
hydrostatic head unfortunately it's not
always<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.570> simple

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
always that simple

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.490 
always that simple
you<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.550> stay<00:02:11.760> perfectly<00:02:12.390> dry<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.200> tent

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you could stay perfectly dry in a tent

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.580 
you could stay perfectly dry in a tent
with<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.830> 3,000<00:02:14.760> millimeter<00:02:15.690> hydrostatic<00:02:16.410> head

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
with a 3,000 millimeter hydrostatic head

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.790 
with a 3,000 millimeter hydrostatic head
for<00:02:16.830> example<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.750> yet<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.260> tent<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
for example and yet go to a tent that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.670 
for example and yet go to a tent that
says<00:02:20.070> he's<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.540> 10000<00:02:21.540> hydrostatic<00:02:22.230> head

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
says he's got a 10000 hydrostatic head

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.510 
says he's got a 10000 hydrostatic head
and<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.910> wet<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.680> let's<00:02:25.830> look<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> few<00:02:26.400> other

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and get wet so let's look at a few other

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.949 
and get wet so let's look at a few other
factors<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.360> want<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.600> take<00:02:27.750> into

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
factors that you want to take into

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.460 
factors that you want to take into
consideration<00:02:29.930> tents<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.050> made<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
consideration tents are made out of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.540 
consideration tents are made out of
different<00:02:32.190> sheets<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:33.440> material<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.620> those

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
could let through some water also water

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.080 
could let through some water also water
may<00:02:47.760> actually<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.540> between<00:02:49.020> two<00:02:49.440> sheets<00:02:49.709> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
may actually get in between two sheets a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.840 
may actually get in between two sheets a
good<00:02:51.090> tent<00:02:51.420> will<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:52.100> good<00:02:53.100> seams<00:02:53.430> there

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
good tent will have good seams there

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.320 
good tent will have good seams there
double<00:02:54.209> stitched<00:02:54.450> they're<00:02:54.870> taped<00:02:55.320> over<00:02:55.560> and

double stitched they're taped over and
they're<00:02:57.330> sealed<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:59.100> also<00:02:59.400> find<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.970> lot

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
they're sealed you also find that a lot

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.350 
they're sealed you also find that a lot
of<00:03:00.390> tents<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.959> actually<00:03:01.440> coated<00:03:02.000> with<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
of tents are actually coated with a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.479 
of tents are actually coated with a
waterproof<00:03:03.870> material<00:03:04.100> making<00:03:05.100> them<00:03:05.220> further

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
waterproof material making them further

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.770 
waterproof material making them further
waterproof<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> water<00:03:07.200> easily<00:03:07.500> runs<00:03:07.890> off

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
waterproof so the water easily runs off

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.270 
waterproof so the water easily runs off
now<00:03:09.780> there's<00:03:10.019> different<00:03:10.170> quality<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.830> tents

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
now there's different quality of tents

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.470 
now there's different quality of tents
and<00:03:11.459> there's<00:03:11.790> different<00:03:11.940> quality<00:03:12.450> of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and there's different quality of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.940 
and there's different quality of
waterproofing<00:03:14.810> waterproofing<00:03:15.810> material<00:03:15.959> can

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
waterproofing waterproofing material can

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.310 
waterproofing waterproofing material can
even<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.459> done<00:03:17.670> damage<00:03:18.209> simply<00:03:18.690> by<00:03:18.900> exposure

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
even be done damage simply by exposure

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.740 
even be done damage simply by exposure
to<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.650> Sun<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.269> depending<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.300> how<00:03:21.510> often

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
to the Sun and depending on how often

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.070 
to the Sun and depending on how often
you<00:03:21.989> use<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:23.160> tent<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.420> quality<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
you use the tent and the quality of the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.259 
you use the tent and the quality of the
tent<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:26.130> may<00:03:26.280> find<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> waterproofing

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
tent you may find that the waterproofing

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.530 
tent you may find that the waterproofing
may<00:03:27.870> only<00:03:28.019> last<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.470> few<00:03:28.680> years<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.670> may<00:03:29.970> last<00:03:30.180> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
may only last a few years it may last a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.620 
may only last a few years it may last a
decade<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.519> let's<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:32.850> get<00:03:32.940> back<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.360> topic

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
decade so let's just get back on topic

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.449 
decade so let's just get back on topic
and<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> quick<00:03:34.830> look<00:03:35.100> at<00:03:35.280> what

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
and have a quick look at what

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.870 
and have a quick look at what
hydrostatic<00:03:35.970> head<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.799> use<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:38.010> as<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.489> guide<00:03:38.850> to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
hydrostatic head is use it as a guide to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.900 
hydrostatic head is use it as a guide to
how<00:03:39.750> waterproof<00:03:40.110> your<00:03:40.410> tent<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
how waterproof your tent is it's not the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.539 
how waterproof your tent is it's not the
only<00:03:42.060> factor<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.769> want<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.010> make<00:03:44.190> sure<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
only factor you want to make sure the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.610 
only factor you want to make sure the
seams<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.060> your<00:03:45.180> tent<00:03:45.480> are<00:03:45.930> good

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
seams on your tent are good

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.229 
seams on your tent are good
they've<00:03:46.920> all<00:03:47.100> been<00:03:47.130> sealed<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.910> they're<00:03:48.150> not

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
they've all been sealed and they're not

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.690 
they've all been sealed and they're not
gonna<00:03:48.390> let<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.690> water<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:50.040> also<00:03:50.160> should<00:03:50.670> have

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
gonna let in water you also should have

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.610 
gonna let in water you also should have
a<00:03:50.880> look<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.299> see<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.780> manufacturer<00:03:52.350> says

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
a look to see if the manufacturer says

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.070 
a look to see if the manufacturer says
their<00:03:52.950> tent<00:03:53.250> has<00:03:53.519> been<00:03:53.910> treated<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.630> you

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
their tent has been treated and you

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.020 
their tent has been treated and you
often<00:03:55.380> see<00:03:55.590> further<00:03:55.980> waterproof<00:03:56.610> treating

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
often see further waterproof treating

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.880 
often see further waterproof treating
and<00:03:57.209> UV<00:03:57.780> treatment

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
and UV treatment

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.949 
and UV treatment
so<00:03:59.890> hopefully<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.909> aren't<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.480> little<00:04:01.749> bit<00:04:01.870> of

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
so hopefully that aren't a little bit of

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.610 
so hopefully that aren't a little bit of
questions<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.650> what<00:04:03.099> hydrostatic<00:04:03.879> head<00:04:04.090> is

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
questions on what hydrostatic head is

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:15.300 
questions on what hydrostatic head is
always<00:04:05.620> left<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:06.010> say<00:04:06.159> happy<00:04:06.849> camping

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310
