00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.479
 we see the mixture 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.320
 that it was a color very similar to 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:14.250
 bricks a little darker and it's a 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.250
 good pasty mixture to work 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.200
 Some people placed directly 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.560
 only with the refractory earth but 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.560
 we consider that it is more convenient is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 put him 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.220
 cement by law 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.060
 in a relationship like the one that specific 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.060
 here we continue preparing more mortar 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.269
 and we are mixing it well the operator what 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.269
 we go when good with the spoon 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.030
 we have it ready to place 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.850
 for bricks the bricks should 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.190
 get wet also at the same time 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.909
 also the place where they will be placed 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.289
 there we are placing as we see 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 the brick will be placed brick 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:24.659
 mirror and with a very small board 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.440
 there we are placing the walls 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 side of the stove measures and 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.840
 dimensions of the stove are 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.840
 specified 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.090
 in the corresponding manual 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.510
 the tip is cleaned we have already built 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.210
 the refractory brick floor and now 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.180
 we are with the side walls are 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 place the mortar a very small layer 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 What are we watching 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.659
 the death of the plastic good has 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.659
 plasticity is easy to work 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.829
 and as we observed on the floor the board is 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.989
 small is about 5 millimeters 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.810
 We continue with this work some 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.900
 bricks like these have a color a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.990
 little clearer that's the product of the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.480
 refractory brick cooking 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 we must also bear in mind that the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.350
 refractory brick will go into view 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.030
 therefore we must leave it well 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.030
 finished we are leveling the wall 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.810
 and placing bricks on the wall that 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.380
 it serves us as a completion of the stove 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 we level 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.700
 to have verticality in the wall and so 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.710
 we continue successively lifting the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.710
 background wall of the tombs 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.810
 in some cases these bricks are 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.450
 lock if possible is better 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.959
 work them but how are they going to see 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.959
 times
