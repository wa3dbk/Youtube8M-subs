00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.229 
if I want you to get a little crazy I
can<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.840> darken<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.400> actually

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
can actually darken this up and actually

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.119 
can actually darken this up and actually
have<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.810> come<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.170> here<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.590> make<00:02:13.650> purple

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
have it come up here and make purple

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.990 
have it come up here and make purple
right<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> paper<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.280> since<00:02:20.340> this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
right on the paper so now since this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.420 
right on the paper so now since this
blue<00:02:21.569> paint<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.140> still<00:02:22.319> wet<00:02:24.680> see<00:02:25.680> how<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> drug

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
blue paint is still wet see how I drug

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.809 
blue paint is still wet see how I drug
that<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.620> turned<00:02:29.099> into<00:02:29.459> purple

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
that and now it's a turned into purple

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.610 
that and now it's a turned into purple
so<00:02:30.000> you're<00:02:30.120> doing<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.480> color<00:02:30.750> mixing<00:02:31.290> write

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so you're doing that color mixing write

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.130 
so you're doing that color mixing write
on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> paper<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.610> could<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.599> mixed<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.989> right

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
on the paper I could have mixed it right

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
on the paper I could have mixed it right
on<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.379> palate<00:02:34.739> made<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.160> own<00:02:35.190> purple<00:02:35.849> but<00:02:36.030> I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
on the palate made my own purple but I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.830 
on the palate made my own purple but I
wanted<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> nice<00:02:36.959> graded<00:02:37.560> wash
