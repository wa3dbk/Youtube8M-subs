00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 But I was barely started. The good thing is that I 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.519
 I just got home from work doing a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.120
 boxe lived here gave the bacon 540 00 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.789
 I want to show here can approach the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.970
 sealed box in any type of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.970
 violence 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.609
 such a house to do that now opening the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.609
 His brother 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 is 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:25.119
 quickly here comes the box comes 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:25.119
 a manual to a warranty 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:43.710
 there comes a power cable and the fan is small 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:49.590
 voted it's nothing but the box 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.970
 Good, let's go to the vote because if it comes to talking 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 well protected here 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.800
 he knows I like it and 540 that come 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.960
 with core i5 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.920
 It's with the memory aunt. 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.720
 and a chair and delivered it is that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.990
 it is not considered a taboo with the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.960
 but adding more sd 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.490
 in it there is the dell itself informs that it 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.700
 it meets the prerequisites of a 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.530
 product weighs very very little 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.790
 dell reported that it is one kilo and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.130
 six hundred and here I am going to give a detail in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.950
 price that pays a price 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.770
 reasonable in relation to the benefits 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.380
 There is a way I believe this is here. 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.900
 our service is true or false. 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.420
 no more dell 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:58.320
 she has a purchase question no no 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.940
 joint that occurs is because he wanted 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.670
 his work here he comes a system 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
 microsoft operating without me as 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.350
 my birthday and not my speed. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.440
 right to have access to windows windows 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.210
 8 with a then it might be up to you that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.370
 be universal do not know but you have 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.320
 right to the original software 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.170
 so I 'm going to ask for reimbursement in 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.840
 relation to software and also the issue 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.720
 antivirus then you might have a new 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.150
 there discount in relation to that in the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.280
 total bill it was made after 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.040
 you buy the product 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.380
 You have to call right and reject the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 partner who sells by case windows 8 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.420
 I do not know if this really goes to the ways 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.569
 in fact, because I only researched it 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.760
 I never did it but I think this is a 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.680
 step ahead of the companion delphi who 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.360
 You 're not buying a set, right? 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.890
 just bought an ultrabook just wanted the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.600
 working on that operating system 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.209
 still because I have the right to 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.310
 university of ideas university 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.769
 right then I suffer, so I'm going to 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.110
 my suffer I do not want only my hair 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.120
 Trying to sell me, then I want to be. 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.480
 reimbursed about it, then this 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.670
 Tip for you that will buy a dell 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.470
 certain other companies may believe 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.930
 This but from what I read to dell 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.280
 first company to accept this is a 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.860
 friendly way 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.870
 We'll call you here to refuse 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.570
 in front of everybody, right after the opening 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.370
 Acre refuse a coming software 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.440
 even because I thought mine suffers that I 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.220
 I have the right to approach the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.220
 hurt the screen 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.400
 It will be the first time I'm calling 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.990
 It may even take him longer. 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.210
 Attention was also drawn to the fact that the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:59.379
 the memory upgrade and the placement is 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.229
 11 m sato a ssd you do not take collateral 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:05.110
 sure also has an excess filed in 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.839
 photos via dell's live in the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.599
 upon purchase these questions it 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.520
 informed that it does not look only you will not 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.939
 lose the warranty if you wish to 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.860
 upgrade in memory and put more 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.270
 receive an emmy saturday 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.339
 however you have to report that 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.029
 is doing it so done done it 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:36.099
 You declare that you do not lose the guarantee. 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:38.139
 It's one more positive point for her is 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.849
 very nice personal website a little bit 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.909
 about the design is very pretty much 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.860
 nice chapter tabuk ever had to 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.999
 opportunity to pick up on macbook is ne 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.819
 but I think it's another level of values 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:53.979
 here in our country but in relation to 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.699
 cost-effective I really believe that 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.699
 be more 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.320
 be one of the best at the moment 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.380
 Let's advance here License time is 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.510

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.910

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.340
 I'm going to be buying this software that 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.270
 Dell is trying not to sell me 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.120
 joint form 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:41.260
 Until then I will not accept these 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:43.000
 made here is talking about is the mark 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.890

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.570
 here it is proven that I do not 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.610
 I pressed right and I do not want to accept 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.920
 the license system and I'm going to 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.630
 request for reimbursement with the right 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.330
 Here's a boxing personal on a first 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:04.350
 vision about fine ultrabook is not like this 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.820
