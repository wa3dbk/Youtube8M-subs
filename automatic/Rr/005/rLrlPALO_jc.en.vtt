okay<00:00:11.629> i<00:00:11.660> sanded<00:00:12.289> it<00:00:12.410> down<00:00:12.469> just<00:00:13.250> actually<00:00:13.459> with

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
okay i sanded it down just actually with

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.280 
okay i sanded it down just actually with
a<00:00:14.119> quick<00:00:15.369> once-over<00:00:16.369> with<00:00:16.759> some<00:00:17.240> 150<00:00:17.869> grit<00:00:18.080> and

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
a quick once-over with some 150 grit and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.310 
a quick once-over with some 150 grit and
that's<00:00:18.590> really<00:00:18.860> all<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.160> needed<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:20.570> was<00:00:20.779> it

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
that's really all it needed it was it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.019 
that's really all it needed it was it
was<00:00:21.470> pretty<00:00:21.680> pretty<00:00:22.130> good<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.550> start<00:00:22.789> with<00:00:23.890> one

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
was pretty pretty good to start with one

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.439 
was pretty pretty good to start with one
drawback<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:27.710> these<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.279> you<00:00:28.580> really<00:00:29.179> do

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
drawback to to these is you really do

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.770 
drawback to to these is you really do
need<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:29.779> part<00:00:30.230> off<00:00:30.410> both<00:00:30.769> ends<00:00:31.419> so<00:00:32.419> what<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:32.720> do

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
need to part off both ends so what I do

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.970 
need to part off both ends so what I do
is<00:00:33.080> I<00:00:33.589> park<00:00:33.890> them<00:00:34.040> down<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.730> must<00:00:35.390> have<00:00:35.540> it

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
is I park them down I must have it

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.829 
is I park them down I must have it
probably<00:00:36.980> close<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.519> sixteenth<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.570> an<00:00:38.720> inch

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
probably close to a sixteenth of an inch

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.640 
probably close to a sixteenth of an inch
maybe<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.290> little<00:00:39.559> more<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:41.629> I'll<00:00:42.199> just<00:00:42.440> cut

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
maybe a little more and I'll just cut

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.100 
maybe a little more and I'll just cut
that<00:00:42.799> off<00:00:42.860> with<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.280> knife<00:00:43.580> after<00:00:43.909> i<00:00:44.540> remove<00:00:45.080> it

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
that off with a knife after i remove it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.910 
that off with a knife after i remove it
from<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.470> from<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.489> lathe<00:00:47.589> one<00:00:48.589> thing<00:00:48.799> we

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
from the from the lathe one thing we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.609 
from the from the lathe one thing we
have<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.100> do<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.360> cut<00:00:50.720> to<00:00:51.170> draw<00:00:51.589> a

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:51.619 
have to do now is to cut to draw a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.219 
have to do now is to cut to draw a
diagonal<00:00:52.010> here<00:00:52.729> so<00:00:53.119> we<00:00:53.299> know<00:00:53.420> where<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.690> make

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
diagonal here so we know where to make

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.729 
diagonal here so we know where to make
the<00:00:54.500> cut<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.839> i'll<00:00:56.839> just<00:00:57.080> take<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.440> from<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the cut and i'll just take it from the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.270 
the cut and i'll just take it from the
edge<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.369> one<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.089> the<00:00:59.180> pummels<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.159> edge

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
edge of one of the pummels to the edge

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.399 
edge of one of the pummels to the edge
of<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.610> opposite<00:01:02.239> pummel<00:01:04.840> which<00:01:05.840> may<00:01:06.049> or<00:01:06.080> may

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
of the opposite pummel which may or may

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.280 
of the opposite pummel which may or may
not<00:01:06.439> end<00:01:06.979> up<00:01:07.670> being<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.330> where<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.049> drew

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
not end up being right on where you drew

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.170 
not end up being right on where you drew
the<00:01:09.439> line<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:10.189> case<00:01:10.430> I'm<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.729> little

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the line in this case I'm a little

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.789 
the line in this case I'm a little
beyond<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.689> line<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:12.579> then<00:01:13.579> just<00:01:14.179> draw<00:01:14.799> your

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
beyond the line and then just draw your

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.630 
beyond the line and then just draw your
diagonal<00:01:16.219> mark<00:01:16.929> and<00:01:18.130> that's<00:01:19.130> where<00:01:19.399> we'll

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
diagonal mark and that's where we'll

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.669 
diagonal mark and that's where we'll
we'll<00:01:20.179> make<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.479> cut<00:01:20.689> on<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> bandsaw<00:01:21.409> to

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
we'll make the cut on the bandsaw to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.510 
we'll make the cut on the bandsaw to
separate<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.219> two<00:01:23.259> door<00:01:24.259> stops<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.219> we<00:01:25.280> can

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
separate the two door stops now we can

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.639 
separate the two door stops now we can
remove<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.850> from<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.119> lathe<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:32.289> as<00:01:33.289> you<00:01:33.469> can

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
remove it from the lathe and as you can

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.319 
remove it from the lathe and as you can
see<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:34.369> hope<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:36.170> I<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.850> have<00:01:37.999> to<00:01:38.119> cut

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
see I hope and this I just have to cut

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.260 
see I hope and this I just have to cut
that<00:01:38.509> off<00:01:38.569> with<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.340> knife<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:41.030> will<00:01:41.149> be

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
that off with a knife and that will be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.599 
that off with a knife and that will be
ready<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.600> go<00:01:44.679> I'll<00:01:45.679> just<00:01:45.859> use<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.100> razor<00:01:46.429> knife

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
ready to go I'll just use a razor knife

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.969 
ready to go I'll just use a razor knife
you<00:01:47.299> can<00:01:47.479> use<00:01:47.659> anything<00:01:48.049> even<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.469> sharp<00:01:48.710> chisel

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
you can use anything even a sharp chisel

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:59.109 
you can use anything even a sharp chisel
and<00:01:49.600> let's<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:51.520> cut<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.639> around<00:01:52.999> just<00:01:58.119> keep

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
and let's just cut it around just keep

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.959 
and let's just cut it around just keep
cutting<00:01:59.389> around<00:02:00.009> slow<00:02:01.009> cuts<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.639> don't<00:02:01.819> want

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
cutting around slow cuts you don't want

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:16.530 
cutting around slow cuts you don't want
to<00:02:02.090> end<00:02:02.389> up<00:02:03.020> with<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.259> divot<00:02:03.709> there

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.340 

we<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:18.520> yeah<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:22.660> turn<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.810> off<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> little

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
we go yeah just turn that off a little

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.240 
we go yeah just turn that off a little
bit<00:02:25.060> same<00:02:26.060> thing<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> other<00:02:26.630> side<00:02:27.250> this

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
bit same thing on the other side this

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.980 
bit same thing on the other side this
side<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.850> little<00:02:29.030> closer<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.780> one

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
side I have a little closer so this one

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:41.410 
side I have a little closer so this one
may<00:02:30.830> go<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> little<00:02:31.310> faster<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:40.060> roll<00:02:41.060> that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
may go a little faster just roll that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:52.280 
may go a little faster just roll that
down

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.280 

okay<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:54.640> take<00:02:54.849> some<00:02:55.090> 150<00:02:55.659> grit<00:02:55.870> paper<00:02:58.290> and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
okay just take some 150 grit paper and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.610 
okay just take some 150 grit paper and
give<00:03:00.189> that<00:03:00.400> up<00:03:00.430> quick<00:03:01.500> rubdown<00:03:07.319> then<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.469> do

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
give that up quick rubdown then you do

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.929 
give that up quick rubdown then you do
this<00:03:08.799> part<00:03:09.129> with<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.090> grain<00:03:10.329> so<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
this part with the grain so that's a

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.429 
this part with the grain so that's a
sandpaper<00:03:12.939> scratches<00:03:13.569> don't<00:03:13.780> show<00:03:14.019> up<00:03:14.170> quite

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
sandpaper scratches don't show up quite

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:24.569 
sandpaper scratches don't show up quite
as<00:03:14.560> much<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.889> should<00:03:24.069> do<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.250> for<00:03:24.370> that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
as much and that should do it for that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.580 
as much and that should do it for that
and<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.389> take<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.629> over<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.139> bandsaw

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and we can take that over the bandsaw

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.679 
and we can take that over the bandsaw
and<00:03:26.620> make<00:03:26.859> that<00:03:27.040> cut<00:03:30.030> okay<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.239> see<00:03:31.450> just

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
and make that cut okay you see just

and a little white hand saying they know
the<00:06:07.849> very<00:06:08.060> tips<00:06:08.479> just<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.229> smooth<00:06:09.889> those<00:06:10.069> out

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.540 
the very tips just to smooth those out
there<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:10.789> found<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:12.280> shape<00:06:13.280> them<00:06:13.520> a

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
there so found that the shape them a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.100 
there so found that the shape them a
little<00:06:13.789> bit<00:06:14.060> on<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.479> belt<00:06:15.289> sander<00:06:15.830> but<00:06:17.110> to

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
little bit on the belt sander but to

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.070 
little bit on the belt sander but to
really<00:06:18.620> do<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.430> nice<00:06:19.699> job<00:06:19.729> but<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.750> thing<00:06:21.050> was

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
really do a nice job but the thing was

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.760 
really do a nice job but the thing was
moves<00:06:21.830> too<00:06:22.069> much<00:06:22.219> wood<00:06:22.490> too<00:06:22.729> fast<00:06:23.060> so<00:06:23.509> I<00:06:23.770> just

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
moves too much wood too fast so I just

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.800 
moves too much wood too fast so I just
give<00:06:24.979> them<00:06:25.069> a<00:06:25.159> little<00:06:25.189> white<00:06:26.050> running<00:06:27.050> and

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
give them a little white running and

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.999 
give them a little white running and
sanding<00:06:29.810> on<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.110> very<00:06:30.289> tips<00:06:32.560> and<00:06:33.560> they're

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
sanding on the very tips and they're

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.559 
sanding on the very tips and they're
done<00:06:35.319> you<00:06:36.319> can<00:06:36.529> put<00:06:37.400> them<00:06:37.490> that<00:06:37.669> way<00:06:37.849> or<00:06:38.029> flip

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
done you can put them that way or flip

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.029 
done you can put them that way or flip
them<00:06:38.689> around<00:06:38.719> that<00:06:39.139> way<00:06:39.289> so<00:06:39.349> the<00:06:39.620> handles

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
them around that way so the handles

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.240 
them around that way so the handles
stick<00:06:40.639> up<00:06:40.789> a<00:06:40.909> little<00:06:41.150> higher<00:06:41.740> however<00:06:42.740> you<00:06:42.979> see

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
stick up a little higher however you see

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.659 
stick up a little higher however you see
fit<00:06:43.279> for<00:06:44.150> a<00:06:44.180> finish<00:06:44.599> I<00:06:44.900> generally<00:06:45.710> either

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
fit for a finish I generally either

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.570 
fit for a finish I generally either
don't<00:06:47.060> finish<00:06:47.330> them<00:06:47.419> at<00:06:47.659> all<00:06:47.870> or<00:06:48.229> I<00:06:48.310> use<00:06:49.310> an<00:06:49.490> oil

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
don't finish them at all or I use an oil

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.990 
don't finish them at all or I use an oil
finish<00:06:50.180> such<00:06:50.419> as<00:06:50.659> a<00:06:50.770> wacko<00:06:51.770> or<00:06:52.159> boiled<00:06:52.819> linseed

finish such as a wacko or boiled linseed

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.050 
finish such as a wacko or boiled linseed
oil<00:06:53.419> this<00:06:54.139> is<00:06:54.319> another<00:06:54.620> one<00:06:54.770> that<00:06:54.919> I<00:06:55.129> made<00:06:55.460> also

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
oil this is another one that I made also

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.800 
oil this is another one that I made also
auto<00:06:56.300> folder<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.650> has<00:06:58.069> a<00:06:58.699> watco<00:06:59.240> finish<00:06:59.599> on

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
auto folder that has a watco finish on

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.290 
auto folder that has a watco finish on
it<00:06:59.840> and<00:07:00.590> I<00:07:01.159> think<00:07:01.340> I<00:07:01.430> ended<00:07:01.759> up<00:07:01.819> putting<00:07:02.060> like

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
it and I think I ended up putting like

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.149 
it and I think I ended up putting like
three<00:07:02.629> coats<00:07:02.870> that<00:07:03.050> it<00:07:03.409> probably<00:07:03.710> could<00:07:03.979> even

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159 
three coats that it probably could even

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:06.730 
three coats that it probably could even
use<00:07:04.279> some<00:07:04.699> more<00:07:04.909> that<00:07:05.120> the<00:07:05.659> wood<00:07:05.900> was<00:07:06.169> real<00:07:06.379> dry

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
use some more that the wood was real dry

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.029 
use some more that the wood was real dry
and<00:07:07.039> just<00:07:07.370> absorbed<00:07:07.879> it<00:07:08.000> like<00:07:08.029> man<00:07:08.509> but<00:07:09.469> there

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
and just absorbed it like man but there

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.469 
and just absorbed it like man but there
you<00:07:10.190> have<00:07:10.219> it<00:07:10.370> the<00:07:11.110> two<00:07:12.110> door<00:07:13.039> stops<00:07:13.400> it's<00:07:14.120> made

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
you have it the two door stops it's made

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.140 
you have it the two door stops it's made
out<00:07:14.509> of<00:07:14.690> one<00:07:15.020> piece<00:07:15.050> of<00:07:15.469> wood<00:07:15.879> quick<00:07:16.879> and<00:07:17.029> easy

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
out of one piece of wood quick and easy

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.469 
out of one piece of wood quick and easy
and<00:07:17.569> the<00:07:18.020> excellent<00:07:18.560> practice<00:07:18.889> for<00:07:19.479> doing

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
and the excellent practice for doing

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:56.090 
and the excellent practice for doing
spindle<00:07:20.960> work

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.100
