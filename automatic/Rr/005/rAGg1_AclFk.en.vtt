what surgery do I need to correct my
eyes<00:00:33.400> my<00:00:34.400> eyes<00:00:34.430> are<00:00:34.880> not<00:00:34.910> even<00:00:35.510> they<00:00:35.840> are

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
eyes my eyes are not even they are

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.010 
eyes my eyes are not even they are
completely<00:00:36.500> different<00:00:36.860> my<00:00:37.820> right<00:00:38.150> eyebrow<00:00:38.450> is

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
completely different my right eyebrow is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.460 
completely different my right eyebrow is
much<00:00:39.379> lower<00:00:39.739> than<00:00:39.920> my<00:00:40.250> left<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.600> right<00:00:41.840> eyelid

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
much lower than my left the right eyelid

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.250 
much lower than my left the right eyelid
comes<00:00:42.829> over<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.280> top<00:00:43.309> of<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> crease<00:00:44.239> when<00:00:45.230> I

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
comes over the top of the crease when I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.920 
comes over the top of the crease when I
pull<00:00:45.590> my<00:00:45.739> right<00:00:45.980> eyebrow<00:00:46.220> up<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:47.300> match<00:00:47.540> the

pull my right eyebrow up to match the
left<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.860> eyes<00:00:49.040> seem<00:00:49.430> normal<00:00:49.699> again<00:00:50.199> so<00:00:51.199> is<00:00:51.530> it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
left the eyes seem normal again so is it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.910 
left the eyes seem normal again so is it
my<00:00:52.160> eyebrows<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:53.089> are<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.420> problem<00:00:53.920> which

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
my eyebrows that are the problem which

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.799 
my eyebrows that are the problem which
surgical<00:00:55.640> procedure<00:00:56.059> would<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.449> recommend

surgical procedure would you recommend

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.710 
surgical procedure would you recommend
to<00:00:57.410> correct<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.970> my<00:00:59.150> right<00:00:59.449> eye

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
to correct this so that my right eye

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.160 
to correct this so that my right eye
looks<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:00.500> my<00:01:00.710> left<00:01:01.239> just<00:01:02.239> want<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.570> add<00:01:02.720> this

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
looks like my left just want to add this

my eyes were perfectly even thank you
for<00:01:11.900> your<00:01:11.990> question<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:13.700> are<00:01:13.939> describing<00:01:14.750> a

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
for your question you are describing a

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.719 
for your question you are describing a
very<00:01:15.640> common<00:01:16.640> problem<00:01:17.479> or<00:01:17.990> situation<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:19.490> we

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
very common problem or situation that we

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.330 
very common problem or situation that we
see<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.030> our<00:01:20.150> practice<00:01:20.380> which<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
see in our practice which is the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.450 
see in our practice which is the
asymmetry<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.049> face<00:01:24.380> resulting<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.340> an

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
asymmetry of the face resulting in an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.780 
asymmetry of the face resulting in an
asymmetry<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.600> shape<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.470> eyes<00:01:27.790> so

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
asymmetry in the shape of the eyes so

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.720 
asymmetry in the shape of the eyes so
your<00:01:29.509> right<00:01:29.780> eyebrow<00:01:30.110> being<00:01:30.740> much<00:01:31.040> lower<00:01:31.430> than

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
your right eyebrow being much lower than

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.240 
your right eyebrow being much lower than
your<00:01:31.910> left<00:01:32.270> if<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.440> something<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.130> has

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
your left if this is something that has

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.140 
your left if this is something that has
always<00:01:34.520> been<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.000> case<00:01:35.410> well<00:01:36.410> then<00:01:37.250> most

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
always been the case well then most

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.570 
always been the case well then most
likely<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.810> has<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.110> do<00:01:39.290> with<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.860> natural

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
likely this has to do with the natural

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.750 
likely this has to do with the natural
bone<00:01:41.210> structure<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.110> then<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.100> soft<00:01:43.460> tissue

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
bone structure and then the soft tissue

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.710 
bone structure and then the soft tissue
overlying<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.780> bone<00:01:44.960> structure<00:01:45.520> being

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
overlying the bone structure being

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.870 
overlying the bone structure being
something<00:01:47.720> that's<00:01:47.990> constant<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:49.550> refer

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
something that's constant and we refer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.770 
something that's constant and we refer
to<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.090> term<00:01:50.480> called<00:01:50.930> hemifacial<00:01:51.530> microsomia

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
to a term called hemifacial microsomia

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.240 
to a term called hemifacial microsomia
which<00:01:53.780> means<00:01:54.050> one<00:01:54.350> side<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.800> face<00:01:55.010> is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
which means one side of the face is

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.149 
which means one side of the face is
smaller<00:01:55.820> than<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.360> other<00:01:56.510> side<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.500> although

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
smaller than the other side so although

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.460 
smaller than the other side so although
you<00:01:58.220> didn't<00:01:58.640> send<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.909> full<00:01:59.120> face<00:01:59.360> picture<00:01:59.960> you

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
you didn't send a full face picture you

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.649 
you didn't send a full face picture you
can<00:02:00.650> take<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> look<00:02:01.159> at<00:02:01.280> yourself<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.940> notice

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
can take a look at yourself and notice

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.780 
can take a look at yourself and notice
that<00:02:02.930> maybe<00:02:03.170> one<00:02:03.590> side<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.370> face<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
that maybe one side of the face the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.859 
that maybe one side of the face the
cheek<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.360> less<00:02:05.770> projected<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.640> when<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.599> have

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
cheek is less projected so when you have

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.339 
cheek is less projected so when you have
this<00:02:09.140> type<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.470> asymmetry<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.450> natural

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
this type of asymmetry it is natural

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.330 
this type of asymmetry it is natural
that<00:02:12.920> soft<00:02:13.370> tissue<00:02:13.489> tends<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.390> descend

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
that soft tissue tends to descend

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.119 
that soft tissue tends to descend
relatively<00:02:16.340> speaking<00:02:17.650> sometimes<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> amount

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
relatively speaking sometimes the amount

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.850 
relatively speaking sometimes the amount
of<00:02:19.370> volume<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> upper<00:02:20.420> eyelid<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.110> such

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
of volume in the upper eyelid is such

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.170 
of volume in the upper eyelid is such
that<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:23.360> obliterates<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:25.190> definition<00:02:26.030> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
that it obliterates the definition of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.280 
that it obliterates the definition of
the<00:02:26.780> eyelid<00:02:27.590> crease<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.450> would<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:30.019> in

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the eyelid crease so what I would do in

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.440 
the eyelid crease so what I would do in
my<00:02:30.590> practice<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.400> someone<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:31.909> you<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.269> now

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
my practice for someone like you and now

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.899 
my practice for someone like you and now
this<00:02:32.599> is<00:02:32.810> based<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.709> photos<00:02:34.159> not<00:02:34.370> based<00:02:34.790> on

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
this is based on the photos not based on

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.750 
this is based on the photos not based on
a<00:02:34.939> physical<00:02:35.420> exam<00:02:35.810> by<00:02:36.189> routinely<00:02:37.189> and<00:02:37.579> in<00:02:37.639> my

2%<00:02:46.580> symmetric<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:48.230> essentially<00:02:49.069> it's<00:02:49.310> all

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
2% symmetric I can essentially it's all

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.809 
2% symmetric I can essentially it's all
about<00:02:49.790> creating<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.200> balance<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.340> when

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
about creating the balance so that when

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.030 
about creating the balance so that when
we<00:02:53.239> look<00:02:53.630> at<00:02:54.170> people<00:02:55.270> most<00:02:56.270> people<00:02:56.420> are

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
we look at people most people are

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
we look at people most people are
actually<00:02:58.060> asymmetric<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.470> so<00:03:00.730> typically<00:03:01.730> in

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
actually asymmetric and so typically in

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.000 
actually asymmetric and so typically in
a<00:03:02.150> situation<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:02.810> yours<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.470> would<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.830> an

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
a situation like yours I would do an

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.750 
a situation like yours I would do an
upper<00:03:04.880> eyelid<00:03:05.239> blepharoplasty<00:03:06.760> basically

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
upper eyelid blepharoplasty basically

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.660 
upper eyelid blepharoplasty basically
conservative<00:03:08.360> removal<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.380> some<00:03:09.830> extra<00:03:10.340> skin

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
conservative removal of some extra skin

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.990 
conservative removal of some extra skin
over<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.569> eye<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.560> compensate<00:03:13.400> for<00:03:13.880> the

about<00:03:46.160> your<00:03:46.489> eyes<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:48.140> upper

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
about your eyes I think that a upper

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.490 
about your eyes I think that a upper
eyelid<00:03:49.459> blepharoplasty<00:03:50.500> done

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
eyelid blepharoplasty done

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.310 
eyelid blepharoplasty done
conservatively<00:03:52.340> done<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.390> try<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.600> match<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
conservatively done to try to match the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.130 
conservatively done to try to match the
crease<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:54.890> other<00:03:55.100> side<00:03:55.510> will<00:03:56.510> probably

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
crease of the other side will probably

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.259 
crease of the other side will probably
be<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.410> most<00:03:57.560> practical<00:03:58.010> solution<00:03:58.609> for<00:03:59.180> you

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
be the most practical solution for you

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.530 
be the most practical solution for you
if<00:03:59.560> there<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.590> any<00:04:01.130> issues<00:04:01.670> with<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.970> dynamic

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
if there is any issues with the dynamic

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.240 
if there is any issues with the dynamic
activity<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.290> muscles<00:04:03.739> in<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:03.980> forehead

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
activity the muscles in the forehead

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.590 
activity the muscles in the forehead
then<00:04:05.120> some<00:04:05.630> Botox<00:04:06.170> or<00:04:06.470> other<00:04:06.650> things<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.280> be

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
then some Botox or other things can be

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.289 
then some Botox or other things can be
implemented<00:04:08.600> as<00:04:08.959> part<00:04:09.350> of<00:04:09.590> your<00:04:09.950> strategy<00:04:10.299> but

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
implemented as part of your strategy but

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.569 
implemented as part of your strategy but
understand<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.859> are<00:04:12.889> beautifully

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
understand that we are beautifully

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.690 
understand that we are beautifully
imperfect<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:15.139> asymmetry<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:16.070> normal

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
imperfect and that asymmetry is normal

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.479 
imperfect and that asymmetry is normal
this<00:04:17.539> being<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.079> particular<00:04:18.620> area<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.100> concern

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
this being a particular area of concern

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.150 
this being a particular area of concern
for<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.120> would<00:04:20.750> say<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.560> right<00:04:21.769> upper

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
for you I would say that the right upper

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.640 
for you I would say that the right upper
eyelid<00:04:22.310> blepharoplasty<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:23.510> probably<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
eyelid blepharoplasty is probably the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.640 
eyelid blepharoplasty is probably the
practical<00:04:25.370> approach<00:04:25.960> without<00:04:26.960> being<00:04:27.289> too

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
practical approach without being too

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.310 
practical approach without being too
aggressive<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.880> give<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.660> little<00:04:29.990> bit<00:04:30.139> more

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
aggressive to give you a little bit more

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.640 
aggressive to give you a little bit more
of<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.560> match<00:04:30.889> between<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.580> two<00:04:31.729> eyes<00:04:32.229> so<00:04:33.229> I

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
of a match between the two eyes so I

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.650 
of a match between the two eyes so I
hope<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.250> was<00:04:34.520> helpful<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:35.000> thank<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.600> for

hope that was helpful and thank you for
