about a week ago I was pretty bored with
the<00:00:10.380> color<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.679> my<00:00:10.769> bike<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> pair

the color of my bike and I have a pair

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.390 
the color of my bike and I have a pair
of<00:00:12.480> shoes<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> really<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.950> texture

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of shoes that I really like the texture

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880 
of shoes that I really like the texture
of<00:00:14.580> them<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> wanted<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
of them so what I wanted to do is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.849 
of them so what I wanted to do is
basically<00:00:17.520> mimic<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> did<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
basically mimic that and what I did is I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.170 
basically mimic that and what I did is I
came<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> technique<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
came up with the technique I like to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.870 
came up with the technique I like to
call<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> Rosenthal<00:00:22.050> method<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.550> call<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
call the Rosenthal method and I call it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
call the Rosenthal method and I call it
that<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.689> favorite<00:00:25.080> MMA<00:00:25.529> referee<00:00:26.010> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that because my favorite MMA referee is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130

colors but I would suggest for drywall
tape<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:56.100> knife<00:00:56.690> sharp<00:00:57.690> rock<00:00:57.930> works<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
tape a knife sharp rock works in this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189 
tape a knife sharp rock works in this
case<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.969> paint<00:01:00.180> brush<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
case and a paint brush I use the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.630 
case and a paint brush I use the
toothbrush<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> situation<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.460> thing

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
toothbrush in the situation first thing

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.619 
toothbrush in the situation first thing
when<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> comes<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> painting<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> you're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
when it comes to painting is you're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.119 
when it comes to painting is you're
gonna<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:03.989> put<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> base<00:01:04.500> coat<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
gonna want to put down a base coat and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
gonna want to put down a base coat and
this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.850> important<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.210> because

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
this is a pretty important one because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.700 
this is a pretty important one because
this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.659> what's<00:01:06.960> gonna<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.229> showing<00:01:07.590> up

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this is what's gonna be showing up

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
this is what's gonna be showing up
through<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.970> later<00:01:09.659> paints<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.140> top<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
through as you later paints on top of it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
through as you later paints on top of it
so<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> lighter<00:01:12.030> color<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.510> gonna

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
so if you use a lighter color it's gonna

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
so if you use a lighter color it's gonna
look<00:01:12.810> good<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> use<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> darker<00:01:14.280> base<00:01:14.430> coat

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
look good if you use a darker base coat

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
look good if you use a darker base coat
and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> technique<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> zebra

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and I use a technique just like zebra

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
and I use a technique just like zebra
stripes<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.500> overall<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> done

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
stripes so that overall when it's done

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
stripes so that overall when it's done
it<00:01:20.220> looks<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.790> tricky<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.450> minute<00:01:21.840> or<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it looks pretty tricky a minute or so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
it looks pretty tricky a minute or so
after<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.470> paint<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> dried<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.340> start

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
after the paint is dried you can start

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
after the paint is dried you can start
applying<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.330> drywall<00:01:24.930> tape<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:25.860> want

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
applying the drywall tape you don't want

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.109 
applying the drywall tape you don't want
to<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.189> when<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.430> too<00:01:26.610> wet<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:26.909> you'll

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to go when it's too wet because you'll

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539 
to go when it's too wet because you'll
get<00:01:27.450> pain<00:01:27.689> everywhere<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> needs<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
get pain everywhere but also it needs to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
get pain everywhere but also it needs to
be<00:01:29.610> somewhat<00:01:29.939> wet<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> tape<00:01:30.810> sticks

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
be somewhat wet so the tape sticks

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.249 
be somewhat wet so the tape sticks
pretty<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.079> much<00:01:34.200> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
pretty well and you can put as much of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
pretty well and you can put as much of
this<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.400> you'd<00:01:35.520> like

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this or as little this on as you'd like

pretty cool part because now you're
gonna<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.100> texture<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.670> we're<00:02:04.090> trying

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240

to<00:02:04.360> accomplish<00:02:04.570> there<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.290> definitely<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
to accomplish there it's definitely the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.749 
to accomplish there it's definitely the
most<00:02:05.950> rewarding<00:02:06.070> part<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.820> whole<00:02:06.940> process

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
most rewarding part of the whole process

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.400 
most rewarding part of the whole process
after<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:10.119> pulled<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> tape<00:02:10.600> off<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:11.140> went<00:02:11.260> ahead

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
after I pulled the tape off I went ahead

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.260 
after I pulled the tape off I went ahead
and<00:02:11.680> threw<00:02:11.740> some<00:02:12.190> splatter<00:02:12.490> paint<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.120> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
and threw some splatter paint on there I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.330 
and threw some splatter paint on there I
think<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.870> gives<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.350> pretty<00:02:14.650> cool<00:02:14.800> look<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
think it gives it a pretty cool look you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.740 
think it gives it a pretty cool look you
don't<00:02:15.430> have<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.060> point<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.540> think

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

it<00:02:16.960> was<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> pretty<00:02:17.680> cool<00:02:17.950> addition<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.820> know

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the way I do the splatter paint is I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.010 
the way I do the splatter paint is I
just<00:02:21.190> spray<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> bunch<00:02:21.820> onto<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.780> head<00:02:22.900> of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
just spray a bunch onto the the head of

just spray a bunch onto the the head of
the<00:02:23.080> toothbrush<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.370> kind<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.180> like
