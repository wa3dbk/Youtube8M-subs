00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
situation at hand and you know one of

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.619 
situation at hand and you know one of
the<00:03:07.810> greatest<00:03:08.049> tricks<00:03:08.909> is<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.359> sort<00:03:10.569> of

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
the greatest tricks is the sort of

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.929 
the greatest tricks is the sort of
dumbing<00:03:11.109> down<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.769> sort<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.040> comfort<00:03:12.669> zone

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.439 
dumbing down the sort of comfort zone
that<00:03:13.359> happens<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.950> we<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:16.239> might

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
that happens and so if we can we might

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.449 
that happens and so if we can we might
have<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.900> go<00:03:17.019> out<00:03:17.199> of<00:03:17.379> our<00:03:17.470> comfort<00:03:17.680> zone<00:03:17.919> a<00:03:18.159> bit

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
have to go out of our comfort zone a bit

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.659 
have to go out of our comfort zone a bit
in<00:03:18.669> order<00:03:18.909> to<00:03:19.239> step<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:19.900> step<00:03:20.260> up<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.799> action

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
in order to step up step up the action

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.420 
in order to step up step up the action
from<00:03:22.030> our<00:03:22.239> own<00:03:22.419> personal<00:03:23.349> perspective<00:03:24.220> you

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.219 
to be afraid of the dark side and I

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.409 
to be afraid of the dark side and I
think<00:04:21.430> that's<00:04:21.579> like<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:23.219> natural<00:04:24.219> step<00:04:25.120> in
