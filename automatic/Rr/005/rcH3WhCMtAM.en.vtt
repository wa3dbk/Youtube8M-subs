00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.590
 very good everyone I'm epsilon and we're 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.469
 one more day with what's attracting the kingdoms 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.419
 public testing of patch 6.2 in 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.060
 this time to show you a preview 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:22.699
 of the meeting against Mr. bills 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.039
 the advances Hellfire Citadel of 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.320
 This meeting will consist of a 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 succession of phases where in a zag a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.669
 He struggles with his ax and in another with his 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.860
 fists modifying parts of their 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.710
 skills throughout the encounter 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.750
 sakun will try to create vile crystals 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.510
 by the wings through fissures in the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.790
 ground and according to the modality there will be greater or 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.739
 fewer of them players 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
 we can avoid the formation of these 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.640
 crystals by placing us on top of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.949
 vile cracks at least five seconds 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.689
 although the last figure you try 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.119
 locked behind that the others no longer 

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:58.610
 have been will always become a 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.920
 crystal virus these vile crystals 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.229
 they will do high damage to anyone 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.720
 to stay close to them and a 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.430
 lower to the whole band every three seconds 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.320
 This is why it is vital that no more than one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.780
 crystal at once emerge from the fissures 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 the crystals last a minute 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.400
 before self-destructing some 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 ttakun skills and absorb 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.110
 a fissure will leave us a prejudice 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.509
 called latent energy skills 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.369
 as a wake of destruction will explode if 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.950
 they come into contact with a player with 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.720
 latent energy or by a vile crystal what 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.270
 that will condition us to get away from the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.950
 crystals yes a wake explodes will 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.869
 area damage of three meters of the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.509
 explosion and all the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.880
 dormant energies while you have 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.890
 latent energy do not close a new 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 fissure or will create another wake of 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.960
 destruction he died when he pulled out a 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.240
 armed with your ax you will use to split souls 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.190
 over the main tank and send it 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.110
 to the realm of the shadows where I left it 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.960
 incorporeal and with a cracked soul 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.530
 receiving 50% more damage from 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.479
 shadows for 15 minutes once there 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.580
 the tank will have to face 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.610
 ring of destruction that will force us to 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.250
 jump on it while it expands if 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.959
 we do not want to take harm when you go out 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.850
 from the kingdom of shadows you will leave 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.790
 latent energy in it as energy 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.200
 residual which will cause constant 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.209
 fabrics or rings inside 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.849
 putting it a bit more complicated for 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.680
 the next central addition to the exit of 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.450
 this kingdom and according to the difficulty of 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.180
 encounter will cause this side 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.909
 destruction while armed too 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.159
 will use cavitation throwing wake 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.500
 destruction random enemies are 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.900
 infected an injury that absorbs the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.000
 healing received and after absorbing the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.920
 enough will explode doing now the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 rest of players within 6 meters 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.800
 so we should get away from the rest 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.620
 from the band 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.290
 when he makes a spear his ax acquires 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.720
 hard hand and a 30% increase in 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.360
 swiftness in his abilities and his ax 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.280
 will be at 30 seconds emitting pulses of 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.800
 Good energy every three seconds of the year 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.780
 fire to the whole band thanks to 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.540
 hard hand benefit during this phase 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.090
 sahagÃºn blows hit demand 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.250
 your main objective to the objective more 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.410
 close to him so the two tanks 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.190
 they should stay together in everything 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.200
 moment 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.240
 in this phase will also launch 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.460
 randomly seeds of destruction 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.010
 about 5 players that will explode 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.020
 doing 8 wake of destruction every 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.930
 one that will be addressed in multiple 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.460
 directions so it's very important 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 get away the most and positions 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.720
 separated from the band before 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.270
 finish those 5 seconds to make it 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.060
 easier to dodge and remember not 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.250
 take it near the pillars in the phase 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.010
 end of the meeting be kun is furious 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.890
 and will jump very armed so that his 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.810
 ax wielded will unleash deflagrations 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.450
 viles as he did in the other phase 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.340
 disarmed and will also win a hard hand 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.200
 hitting the closest target 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.720
 although principal until the end of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.580
 encounter and until here this preview 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.709
 of the meeting against Mr. Vilsack um 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 I hope you have served for Help A 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.030
 greeting and until next time
