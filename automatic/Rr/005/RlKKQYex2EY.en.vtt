00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.480
 best regards love with guardians my 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 name is andre peschke and i love 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 destiny dark about the new dsi 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.690
 lurking, however, I have a lot to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 blaspheme and that's enough for me 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 We also start right now 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 catch the three worst things in the field 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 we with the price performance ratio 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 that is in a nutshell, under all it's clean 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 are Rainer's great emissions the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 about an hour last three 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.640
 mehrspieler maps two new strikes and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.399
 a raid and the raid is pretty much 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 the only really significant new one 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.680
 content all for 20 euros so one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.120
 third of the main game new band you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.420
 actually like a new planet 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.829
 and not just around kokolores 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 clearly not enough 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.160
 that's not just not enough no it is 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.870
 especially not enough new ones 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.579
 turn out to be new strikes 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.379
 quickly as a recycled story 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 We only send backwards 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.880
 Play opponents and boss opponents take 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.430
 they are recycled there is no 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.110
 Real new villains there is one 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 few variants that grow that was it then 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.850
 even the new story missions 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 also to 80 already known to them 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.180
 command how bungie if you are 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.220
 already 20 euro price tag on it cardboard 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.840
 that the actual new content for that 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.820
 created and not just already 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.190
 existing environments with others 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.190
 Filled opponents who have been nice 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 remains point number three superior 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 Let's just briefly to extent too small 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.330
 four recycling too expensive sold like 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 you can put the crown on the whole 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
 exactly in which one still tries the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 customers at gunpoint to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.150
 to force them to fund that makes the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 for example by making a new strike 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.500
 playlist just opened for 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.510
 This customer is accessible at the same time 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.160
 Devaluate the remaining strike 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.050
 playlist because there is now 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.290
 mission rewards now no end 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.910
 more 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.190
 also the weekly strikes became the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.170
 release of darkness lurking along nicely 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.850
 you have content pasted there 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.380
 can be owner of the pure main game 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.690
 then for a week in the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.760
 The tube will practice that will take you in 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 future certainly will happen more often 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.870
 because the more it appears the more 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.000
 This kind of game becomes more common 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.540
 content locked for you for one week 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540
