right on here right on that layer of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.690 
right on here right on that layer of
crescent<00:03:15.600> roll<00:03:15.750> dough<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:20.609> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
crescent roll dough now and then the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.270 
crescent roll dough now and then the
next<00:03:20.730> thing<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.390> wonderful<00:03:21.600> cheese<00:03:22.280> this

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
next thing is this wonderful cheese this

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.680 
next thing is this wonderful cheese this
is<00:03:23.430> probably<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.730> most<00:03:23.850> time-consuming<00:03:24.269> part

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
is probably the most time-consuming part

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.870 
is probably the most time-consuming part
of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> whole<00:03:25.470> recipe<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.160> opening<00:03:26.700> this

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
of the whole recipe is opening this

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.750 
of the whole recipe is opening this
cheese<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.440> makes<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.950> think<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.489> lot<00:03:29.730> of

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
cheese and it makes I think a lot of

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.270 
cheese and it makes I think a lot of
waste<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:31.019> not<00:03:31.260> crazy<00:03:31.470> about<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:32.010> at<00:03:32.160> all

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
waste I'm not crazy about this at all

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.300 
waste I'm not crazy about this at all
but<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.780> cheap<00:03:37.340> okay<00:03:38.340> now<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.209> next<00:03:39.389> thing

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
but it is cheap okay now the next thing

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.190 
but it is cheap okay now the next thing
are<00:03:41.310> these<00:03:41.489> wonderful<00:03:42.000> crescent<00:03:42.450> rolls<00:03:42.660> again

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
are these wonderful crescent rolls again

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.789 
are these wonderful crescent rolls again
now<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:45.540> gonna<00:03:45.660> try<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.709> if

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
now I'm gonna try it this way to see if

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.620 
now I'm gonna try it this way to see if
it<00:03:46.920> helps<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.370> first<00:03:47.579> time<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.880> was<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.150> sort

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it helps the first time I was like sort

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.960 
it helps the first time I was like sort
of<00:03:48.720> slipping<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.530> sliding<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.280> casserole

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
of slipping and sliding on the casserole

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.580 
of slipping and sliding on the casserole
when<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> was<00:03:51.329> trying<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.780> build<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.139> top<00:03:52.319> layer

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
when I was trying to build the top layer

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.400 
when I was trying to build the top layer
so<00:03:53.450> I'm<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.600> going<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.780> try<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:54.959> lay<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.290> out

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
so I'm just going to try to lay it out

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.910 
so I'm just going to try to lay it out
on<00:03:55.470> my<00:03:56.269> parchment<00:03:57.269> paper<00:03:57.660> which<00:03:58.500> doesn't

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
on my parchment paper which doesn't

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.059 
on my parchment paper which doesn't
stick<00:03:59.329> and<00:04:00.329> get<00:04:00.810> everything<00:04:01.079> joined<00:04:01.650> up<00:04:01.859> well

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
stick and get everything joined up well

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.070 
stick and get everything joined up well
and<00:04:02.310> then<00:04:02.459> move<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.879> over<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.510> pan<00:04:03.750> we'll

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
and then move it over to the pan we'll

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.089 
and then move it over to the pan we'll
see<00:04:04.260> if<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.409> works
