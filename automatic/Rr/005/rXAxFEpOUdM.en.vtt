00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
better options so far I haven't found

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420 
better options so far I haven't found
one<00:02:30.999> the<00:02:31.659> size<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.349> lightweightness<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
one the size and lightweightness of this

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.580 
one the size and lightweightness of this
is<00:02:33.639> really<00:02:33.969> really<00:02:34.420> better<00:02:34.719> in<00:02:34.870> fact<00:02:35.019> than

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
is really really better in fact than

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.440 
is really really better in fact than
anything<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:35.980> found<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.700> C<00:02:36.939> stand<00:02:37.299> that's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
anything I found the C stand that's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.849 
anything I found the C stand that's
holding<00:02:37.780> all<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.019> actually<00:02:38.379> waste<00:02:38.530> more

than<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.549> does<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.209> that's<00:02:40.629> kind<00:02:40.900> of

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
than this does and that's kind of

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.119

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.659 
more I could use a fill okay simple like
last<00:03:08.169> light<00:03:08.439> panelist<00:03:08.889> pop<00:03:09.159> some<00:03:09.370> light<00:03:09.519> in

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
last light panelist pop some light in

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.520 
last light panelist pop some light in
but<00:03:10.269> mostly<00:03:10.569> this<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.870> gonna<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.079> filling<00:03:11.319> in

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
but mostly this is gonna be filling in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.649 
but mostly this is gonna be filling in
ambient<00:03:12.159> light<00:03:12.340> okay<00:03:12.969> works<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.449> well

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
ambient light okay works really well
