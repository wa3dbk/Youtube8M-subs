00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
it gives me like a I don't know it

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.799 
it gives me like a I don't know it
allows<00:00:59.079> me<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.379> just<00:00:59.739> sort<00:00:59.889> of<00:00:59.979> I<00:01:00.280> can<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.479> end<00:01:01.659> up

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
allows me to just sort of I can I end up

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.799 
allows me to just sort of I can I end up
going<00:01:02.289> into<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.739> room<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.190> sort<00:01:03.399> of<00:01:03.809> ranting

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
going into a room and sort of ranting

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.390 
going into a room and sort of ranting
and<00:01:04.960> going<00:01:05.230> off<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:05.560> things<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.010> maybe<00:01:06.190> being

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
and going off on things and maybe being

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.430 
and going off on things and maybe being
somewhat<00:01:06.760> amusing<00:01:07.030> hopefully<00:01:07.840> or<00:01:08.230> obnoxious

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
somewhat amusing hopefully or obnoxious

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.970 
somewhat amusing hopefully or obnoxious
but<00:01:09.010> just<00:01:09.490> because<00:01:09.700> I'm<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.030> nervous<00:01:10.960> but<00:01:11.860> then

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
but just because I'm so nervous but then

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.860 
but just because I'm so nervous but then
obviously<00:01:12.130> doing<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.610> scene<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.420> different

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
obviously doing the scene is a different

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.520 
obviously doing the scene is a different
thing<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.530> mean<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.040> guess<00:01:15.190> my<00:01:15.430> my<00:01:15.820> general

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
thing I mean I guess my my general

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.680 
thing I mean I guess my my general
approach<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.280> maybe<00:01:18.490> my<00:01:18.820> tip<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.420> guess

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
approach to it and maybe my tip I guess

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.690 
approach to it and maybe my tip I guess
was<00:01:19.960> always<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:24.070> focus<00:01:24.490> on

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
was always just to really just focus on

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.060 
was always just to really just focus on
the<00:01:25.330> other<00:01:25.480> person<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.230> you're<00:01:26.380> reading
