00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 The beauty speaks to the president. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.990
 a video this time a cat bringing 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.639
 Here's another episode of analysis. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 says carl landry that playing in the scheme 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 besides having your picture 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 beauty point this time will analyze the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 dogs milk a house according to the swap 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.500
 of water 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 I analyzed the oxy was ok blade a lot of people 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 likes to read quite such a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 feature perceived it is well 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 fast but his strength is very bad he is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 in one hour and seven minutes of 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.390
 game 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.200
 the maximum life for a level 10 life 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 Maximum him until you're okay so 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 relatively good 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.379
 remembering that we always take 110 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 less because there is a 10 more there 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 and also takes away whenever I have a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.210
 bonus there a crutch that gives the password more 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.000
 of life 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.570
 then there is 635 600 to 650 is that one 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 life in or not very good but it is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.060
 good speed very good speed it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 It's very fast armor the armor is well 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.509
 little woman who is amateur is very 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 weak 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 and it is accepted as critical one of the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 best critical hits he heard from 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.189
 challenger training such more or 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 but everything there, seeing life as maximum power 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.350
 Elementary is matured more or less 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.310
 heroes callender neighborhood - relationship of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.860
 forces on very good such but thinking 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.299
 so in consideration is too much of the time 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.909
 Look, is not this his hair? 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.970
 just look at these slides it was much of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.689
 happy hour blush on the moral beauty 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.060
 improvements let's go upstairs 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.570
 the square part to take a shock 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.399
 great year that this wheel in apet 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.960
 triangle to take a fragment of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.030
 ice and freeze enemies 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 the andré chakra new layer of ice 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 increasing square safe damage to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.360
 charge the chakra and release to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.330
 So, you throw the show, but your wheel 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.710
 The 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.380
 that you give an attack with the triangle 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.420
 that a fragment of freezing ice 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.490
 enemy of being very useful who 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.130
 You hold the square this wheel 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.560
 this was a mega-combo attack and with 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.170
 this little wheel with the idea of 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.210
 low to top is safe care for 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.070
 charge the chakra and release to 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.910
 chakra and shoot ice in all 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.010
 directions 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.080
 There you improve your wheel and here 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.390
 been entering to load the circle of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.390
 freeze an entire area 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.060
 there you choose is how you prefer 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.590
 Do you want the for or the wheel or the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 good thaw 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.850
 they are very complementary what 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.070
 complement what it means 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.800
 one complements the other 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.810
 needs the other is very good with 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.540
 others work very well on team I 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.940
 I say then that it is very weak to 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.860
 you freeze the guy and 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.390
 there to hit him it's very say that 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.890
 they are enemies 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.750
 those who spin around who are well 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.060
 chatinhos and freezes them and kept beating 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.709
 in them it is very useful here with enemies 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 big does not work you can not 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.390
 freeze what you might improve 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.660
 from below you get ok then you 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.580
 decide and I preferred to leave here because 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.340
 it only work there exists shrapnel 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.519
 Ice this helps with small enemies 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.989
 as draft beer in a bag and what your 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.700
 attack got stronger I prefer it a lot 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.440
 more is beating rollaway stay 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.820
 frozen the faces are so 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.830
 I prefer it above but it's a matter of 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.989
 opinion I thought it would be best to 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.290
 These two are here to improve. 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.360
 only increases more damage ok it comes 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.060
 the get-together of attacks increases the chance 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.640
 critical strike and causes frozen damage 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.489
 extra good so his critical hit 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.800
 It is so high for emerge account that does 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 have a greater chance of being critical and 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.580
 extra dad, okay, okay 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.310
 press ball to give a little blow 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.180
 forward and inflict enemy damage on the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.030
 way 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.340
 Okay, so you skid the start. 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.830
 leaving the way an ice track 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.930
 is of beauty enemies leaves a trail 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.459
 that the enemy step in the rear would be 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.530
 type letting the enemies slow down 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.340
 delayed movement 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.330
 ok the armor improved so tough 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.840
 how much a glacier 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.550
 is this times remains weak, I'm not sure 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.620
 ball to perform a maneuver with 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.419
 skates that deals damage in enemy trance 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.460
 next if you take a very tailspin 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.189
 crazy that attacks the enemies 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.819
 Good, you, I chose from below because 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.800
 on here 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.599
 hold ball to never had enemy 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.330
 where the enemy falls it happens more 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.449
 cold freezing safe balls and slides 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 It's kind of like this back and an ice shell . 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.590
 so type the barrier you hit 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.710
 enemy and I think it's a good team. 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.539
 interesting in medicine is the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.069
 ball to give at home and now leaves the 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.360
 trail an ice trail that cause 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.190
 enemy damage 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.500
 this ice trail or I did not choose 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.509
 why so you leave the ice island 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.849
 then the enemy has to go through the trail 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.860
 If he does not come , it will not work. 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.629
 nothing then this business of leaving a 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.099
 track to the enemy pass I guess 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.449
 very useless so I prefer to 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.449
 the lower the better 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.849
 ok is that their damage increased right and 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.009
 here I was more winsome and not 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:35.800
 are interrupted being attacked 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:38.419
 Ok let's test part freezes the project 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.729
 it is a short time but the general understanding 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.409
 more 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.089
 she's very fast here you hold 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.110
 come back so several genes do not 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.969
 look how cool 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.779
 it holds red well of the time who 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.039
 now come on 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.710
 here we did that afternoon, pointing out that 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.770
 a piece of ice behind me space 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.830
 online more slowly I needed to hold 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.870
 the boot has to give a final twist 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.870
 direct and indirect right 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.969
 so basically this has a range 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.710
 to launch that even the player see 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.149
 good, that's it folks hope you 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.669
 have enjoyed this fluid analysis 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:24.849
 milk girl did not forget to leave the 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:27.249
 his laity with his favorite is to comment on the 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.889
 It's very important for me, but what? 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:34.169
 just asked but the pens and this 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.169
 Okay, people said it and I went
