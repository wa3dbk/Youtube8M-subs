00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
30% body fat and I was wondering which

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.379 
30% body fat and I was wondering which
is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> best<00:00:13.019> way<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.650> losing<00:00:14.130> weight<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.790> it

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is the best way of losing weight is it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.870 
is the best way of losing weight is it
doing<00:00:16.049> lighter<00:00:16.500> weight<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.640> more

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
doing lighter weight with more

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.689 
doing lighter weight with more
repetitions<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:19.439> heavier<00:00:19.890> weight<00:00:20.100> with

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
repetitions or doing heavier weight with

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.480 
repetitions or doing heavier weight with
less<00:00:21.270> repetitions<00:00:21.689> okay<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.189> two

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
less repetitions okay now you have two

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
less repetitions okay now you have two
kinds<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> muscle<00:00:24.029> fibre<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.660> type<00:00:25.080> one

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
kinds of muscle fibre one is type one

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.130 
kinds of muscle fibre one is type one
and<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.430> other<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.789> type<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.900> type

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and the other one is type two that type

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
and the other one is type two that type
one<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.789> Indian<00:00:29.789> specific<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.449> type<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
one is Indian specific and type two is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
one is Indian specific and type two is
strength<00:00:32.099> specific<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.329> working

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
strength specific now when you working

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
strength specific now when you working
on<00:00:33.750> type<00:00:33.989> okay<00:00:34.530> tell<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.399> let's<00:00:35.670> not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on type okay tell you what let's not

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.580 
on type okay tell you what let's not
make<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.149> complicated<00:00:36.480> let<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.440> try

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
make a very complicated let me just try

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
make a very complicated let me just try
and<00:00:37.680> explain<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> simplest

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and explain this to you in the simplest

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
and explain this to you in the simplest
way<00:00:39.480> possible<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:40.590> try<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.920> lift<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
way possible so let's try and lift a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
way possible so let's try and lift a
light<00:00:41.460> weight<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.360> I've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.690> bottle

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
light weight so I've got this bottle

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
light weight so I've got this bottle
over<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.710> close<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.489> one

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
over here which is close to me but one

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.750 
over here which is close to me but one
and<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> half<00:00:44.969> kgs<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.100> try<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> let's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and a half kgs so if I try and do let's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.279 
and a half kgs so if I try and do let's
say<00:00:47.940> 10<00:00:48.210> repetitions<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.079> weight

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
say 10 repetitions with this weight

00:00:49.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
say 10 repetitions with this weight
let's<00:00:49.710> try<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.160> 1<00:00:50.610> 2<00:00:51.570> 3<00:00:52.670> 4<00:00:53.670> 5<00:00:54.620> 6<00:00:55.620> 7<00:00:56.340> 8<00:00:56.850> 9<00:00:58.670> 10

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
let's try it out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
let's try it out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.410> lifting<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> weight<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
do you think lifting this weight is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.329 
do you think lifting this weight is
going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.300> any<00:01:03.539> difference<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> muscle

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
going to make any difference to a muscle

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
going to make any difference to a muscle
the<00:01:05.339> answer<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.750> weight<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the answer is no because the weight is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.800 
the answer is no because the weight is
too<00:01:07.350> light<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.220> weight<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> not

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
too light or the weight is not

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
too light or the weight is not
challenging<00:01:09.810> enough<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.350> muscle<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.369> forget

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
challenging enough my muscle so forget

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
challenging enough my muscle so forget
10<00:01:11.880> repetitions<00:01:12.180> even<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.840> try<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.110> do

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
10 repetitions even if I try and do

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
10 repetitions even if I try and do
let's<00:01:13.470> say<00:01:13.650> 60<00:01:14.340> repetitions<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> 100

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
let's say 60 repetitions or 100

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
let's say 60 repetitions or 100
repetitions<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.759> any

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
repetitions this will not make any

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
repetitions this will not make any
difference<00:01:18.630> whatsoever<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> weight

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
difference whatsoever because the weight

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.859 
difference whatsoever because the weight
is<00:01:20.340> too<00:01:20.549> light<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.540> weight<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> not

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
is too light or the weight is not

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
is too light or the weight is not
challenging<00:01:22.710> enough<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:22.950> me<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.060> other

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
challenging enough for me on the other

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
challenging enough for me on the other
hand<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.049> try<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.409> lift<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:25.830> heavy

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
hand if I try and lift something heavy

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.430 
hand if I try and lift something heavy
something<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:28.970> dumbbell

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.020 

okay<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.620> let's<00:01:33.770> try<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.190> do<00:01:34.340> ten

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
okay and let's try and do ten

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.109 
okay and let's try and do ten
repetitions<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:36.500> second<00:01:38.050> so<00:01:39.050> let's<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.350> one

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
repetitions one second so let's do one

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:51.240 
repetitions one second so let's do one
two<00:01:41.650> three<00:01:43.060> four<00:01:44.710> five<00:01:46.150> six<00:01:49.150> yeah

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
two three four five six yeah

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.680 
two three four five six yeah
nine<00:01:53.110> okay<00:01:54.909> okay<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:55.970> this<00:01:56.150> was<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.360> heavyweight

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
nine okay okay so this was a heavyweight

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.870 
nine okay okay so this was a heavyweight
and<00:01:57.070> do<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.159> think<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> big

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and do you think this is a big

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.180 
and do you think this is a big
difference<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.300> muscle<00:01:59.509> the<00:02:00.409> answer<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.800> yes

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
difference to a muscle the answer is yes

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.030 
difference to a muscle the answer is yes
because<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.970> weight<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.150> heavy<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.350> is

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
because the weight is heavy and is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.529 
because the weight is heavy and is
challenging<00:02:04.490> up<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.030> me<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:05.300> if<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.420> can

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
challenging up for me so if you can

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.109 
challenging up for me so if you can
figure<00:02:05.690> out<00:02:05.840> by<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:07.009> doing<00:02:07.160> 10<00:02:07.850> repetitions

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
figure out by just doing 10 repetitions

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.249 
figure out by just doing 10 repetitions
with<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> speed

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
with this speed

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.820 
with this speed
I'm<00:02:09.440> already<00:02:10.039> slightly<00:02:10.640> puffing<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.360> panting

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
I'm already slightly puffing and panting

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.320 
I'm already slightly puffing and panting
because<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.430> heart<00:02:13.820> rate<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.060> slightly

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
because my heart rate is slightly

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.170 
because my heart rate is slightly
elevated<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.739> answer<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.100> question<00:02:16.370> what<00:02:17.090> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
elevated so to answer a question what is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.979 
elevated so to answer a question what is
more<00:02:17.360> effective

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
more effective

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.729 
more effective
it's<00:02:18.110> obviously<00:02:18.980> doing<00:02:19.959> more<00:02:20.959> or<00:02:21.200> heavy

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
it's obviously doing more or heavy

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's obviously doing more or heavy
weights<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.700> lesser<00:02:23.300> repetitions<00:02:24.430> but

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
weights with lesser repetitions but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.030 
weights with lesser repetitions but
having<00:02:25.910> said<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.510> you're<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> beginner<00:02:27.260> do

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
having said that if you're a beginner do

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.070 
having said that if you're a beginner do
not<00:02:28.310> straightaway<00:02:28.910> jump<00:02:29.209> into<00:02:29.510> lifting<00:02:29.870> very

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
not straightaway jump into lifting very

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.650 
not straightaway jump into lifting very
heavy<00:02:30.410> weights<00:02:30.860> or<00:02:31.040> else<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.910> chances<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
heavy weights or else the chances of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.280 
heavy weights or else the chances of
injury<00:02:33.019> are<00:02:33.709> very<00:02:34.250> high<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:35.030> bones

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
injury are very high because your bones

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.660 
injury are very high because your bones
also<00:02:36.290> your<00:02:36.590> joints<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.130> muscle<00:02:37.519> not

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
also your joints I a muscle not

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.670 
also your joints I a muscle not
conditioned<00:02:38.180> enough<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.260> start<00:02:39.590> with

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
conditioned enough for it so start with

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
conditioned enough for it so start with
lighter<00:02:39.890> weights<00:02:40.190> but<00:02:40.730> gradually<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
lighter weights but gradually and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.720 
lighter weights but gradually and
progressively<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.829> have<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.310> start<00:02:43.549> lifting

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
progressively you have to start lifting

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.030 
progressively you have to start lifting
heavy<00:02:44.120> because<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.260> fastest<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
heavy because that is the fastest and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.789 
heavy because that is the fastest and
the<00:02:46.070> best<00:02:46.370> way<00:02:46.880> for<00:02:47.090> building<00:02:47.989> lean<00:02:48.769> muscle

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
the best way for building lean muscle

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.690 
the best way for building lean muscle
tissue<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.959> losing<00:02:50.959> body<00:02:51.470> fat<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.040> don't

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.280 
tissue and losing body fat and don't
worry<00:02:52.880> about<00:02:53.000> getting<00:02:53.239> bigger<00:02:53.630> by<00:02:53.959> lifting

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
worry about getting bigger by lifting

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
worry about getting bigger by lifting
heavy<00:02:54.500> weights<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.220> purely<00:02:55.519> because<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:56.090> you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
heavy weights it's purely because if you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.750 
heavy weights it's purely because if you
want<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.810> get<00:02:56.989> bigger<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:57.739> not<00:02:58.400> only<00:02:58.430> you
