this<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.199> Lowe's<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:05.250> called<00:01:05.460> plant

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this at Lowe's just called plant

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.780 
this at Lowe's just called plant
training<00:01:06.119> wire<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.990> covered<00:01:07.350> by<00:01:07.500> plastic

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
training wire it's covered by plastic

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.070 
training wire it's covered by plastic
green<00:01:08.790> plastic<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.390> works<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.810> good

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
green plastic which works really good

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
green plastic which works really good
rather<00:01:10.619> than<00:01:10.830> making<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.490> own

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
rather than making some of your own

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
rather than making some of your own
trellises<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:13.020> stretch<00:01:13.650> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
trellises so I'm gonna stretch this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
trellises so I'm gonna stretch this
along<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> bottom<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.509> we'll<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
along the bottom and then we'll get to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
along the bottom and then we'll get to
tying<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> top<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> bottom<00:01:17.490> okay<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.360> can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
tying it top to bottom okay so you can

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
tying it top to bottom okay so you can
see<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.780> trellis<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.189> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
see my trellis here we're gonna just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.600 
see my trellis here we're gonna just
stretch<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.909> line<00:01:21.360> across<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> bottom<00:01:22.610> give

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
stretch this line across the bottom give

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700 
stretch this line across the bottom give
it<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> few<00:01:23.970> wraps<00:01:24.299> around<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> bottom<00:01:24.900> we'll

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it a few wraps around the bottom we'll

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.940 
it a few wraps around the bottom we'll
just<00:01:25.920> stretch<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> wire<00:01:26.520> across<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> bottom

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.359 

so<00:01:31.729> we<00:01:31.909> have<00:01:32.119> our<00:01:32.360> wire<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.110> tied<00:01:33.799> all<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.100> way

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
so we have our wire now tied all the way

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.910 
so we have our wire now tied all the way
across<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.030> bottom<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:36.110> see<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.409> going<00:01:36.680> along

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
across the bottom you see it going along

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.320 
across the bottom you see it going along
the<00:01:37.100> bottom<00:01:37.130> through<00:01:37.640> those<00:01:37.820> tomatoes

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the bottom through those tomatoes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.929 
the bottom through those tomatoes
beautiful<00:01:38.990> tomato<00:01:39.259> plants<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.549> goes<00:01:40.700> all

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
beautiful tomato plants and it goes all

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.179 
beautiful tomato plants and it goes all
the<00:01:40.970> way<00:01:41.509> over<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.049> other<00:01:42.170> side<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.009> this

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
the way over to the other side and this

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.160 
the way over to the other side and this
is<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:43.460> I've<00:01:43.580> anchored<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.149> trellis<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:45.049> by

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
is how I've anchored the trellis just by

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.789 
is how I've anchored the trellis just by
putting<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.979> post<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:47.479> nailed<00:01:48.380> into<00:01:48.680> the

attached<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.920> goes<00:01:52.009> up<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.490> the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
attached to it that goes up to the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.270 
attached to it that goes up to the
trellis<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.229> see<00:01:54.229> up<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.710> Charles<00:01:55.039> there

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
trellis you see up to the Charles there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090 
trellis you see up to the Charles there
runs<00:01:55.939> across<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.689> then<00:01:57.110> down<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.619> other<00:01:57.770> side

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
runs across and then down the other side

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.260 
runs across and then down the other side
with<00:01:58.880> another<00:01:59.149> anchor<00:01:59.720> on<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.899> other<00:02:00.020> side

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
with another anchor on the other side

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.520 
with another anchor on the other side
okay<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.330> I'm<00:02:02.570> gonna<00:02:02.720> start<00:02:03.050> threading<00:02:03.289> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
okay so I'm gonna start threading the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.469 
okay so I'm gonna start threading the
string<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.159> down<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.179> girl<00:02:05.360> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
string up and down so I can girl the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:15.290 
string up and down so I can girl the
tomatoes<00:02:05.840> up<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.110> straight

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.350 

you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.699 

so<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.569> I've<00:02:21.870> got<00:02:22.049> all<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.379> strings

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
so now that I've got all the strings

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.100 
so now that I've got all the strings
tied<00:02:22.980> top<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> bottom<00:02:23.610> spread<00:02:24.209> out<00:02:24.360> nicely<00:02:24.599> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
tied top to bottom spread out nicely I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.869 
tied top to bottom spread out nicely I
almost<00:02:25.590> used<00:02:25.980> about<00:02:26.250> 500<00:02:26.790> yards<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:28.069> thread<00:02:29.069> so

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
almost used about 500 yards of thread so

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.210 
almost used about 500 yards of thread so
that<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> lot<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.560> increased<00:02:31.980> my

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
that is a lot so I really increased my

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.369 
that is a lot so I really increased my
growing<00:02:32.549> area<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
growing area if you think about it that

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.710 
growing area if you think about it that
way<00:02:34.590> where<00:02:35.280> each<00:02:35.489> vine<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:36.000> travel<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.450> those

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
way where each vine can travel up those

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.140 
way where each vine can travel up those
and<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.799> grow<00:02:38.040> taller<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:39.000> they

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
and actually grow taller than they

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
and actually grow taller than they
usually<00:02:39.420> would<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.409> fall<00:02:40.650> over

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
usually would have when they fall over

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.069 
usually would have when they fall over
so<00:02:41.579> I'm<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.909> use<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.239> support<00:02:42.690> system

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
so I'm going to use this support system

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.069 
so I'm going to use this support system
in<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> middle<00:02:43.530> when<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.129> weight<00:02:44.310> starts

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
in the middle when the weight starts

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.649 
in the middle when the weight starts
coming<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.230> they'll<00:02:46.860> rest<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.060> doesn't<00:02:48.360> say

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
coming in they'll rest so it doesn't say

00:02:48.659 --> 00:03:00.530 
coming in they'll rest so it doesn't say
in<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.470> middle<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.760> that's<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.209> got<00:03:00.390> my

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
in the middle so that's it I got my

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.970 
in the middle so that's it I got my
support<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.049> there<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> tomatoes

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
support in there so when the tomatoes

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.190 
support in there so when the tomatoes
start<00:03:02.160> growing<00:03:02.519> they<00:03:03.060> won't<00:03:03.269> pull<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.930> cable

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
start growing they won't pull that cable

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
start growing they won't pull that cable
down<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.769> middle<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.159> actually<00:03:05.819> reduce

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
down in the middle and actually reduce

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.729 
down in the middle and actually reduce
the<00:03:06.390> effective<00:03:06.780> area<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.200> they<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.560> climb

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
the effective area that they can climb

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.610 
the effective area that they can climb
up<00:03:07.799> now<00:03:08.609> it'll<00:03:08.940> stay<00:03:09.239> nice<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:09.870> taut<00:03:10.079> as<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
up now it'll stay nice and taut as the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.470 
up now it'll stay nice and taut as the
tomatoes<00:03:10.950> climb<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.370> let's<00:03:11.940> give<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> close

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
tomatoes climb up let's give you a close

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
tomatoes climb up let's give you a close
looks<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.019> my<00:03:13.140> tomatoes<00:03:13.560> are<00:03:13.709> big<00:03:13.859> enough<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
looks on my tomatoes are big enough to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.979 
looks on my tomatoes are big enough to
start<00:03:14.400> winding<00:03:14.640> I'll<00:03:15.299> show<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.629> how<00:03:15.840> it's

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
start winding I'll show you how it's

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.080 
start winding I'll show you how it's
done<00:03:16.099> okay<00:03:17.099> so<00:03:17.129> here's<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.519> tomato<00:03:17.819> plant

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
done okay so here's the tomato plant

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
done okay so here's the tomato plant
that's<00:03:18.269> just<00:03:18.480> tall<00:03:18.659> enough<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.930> start<00:03:19.349> chowing

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
that's just tall enough to start chowing

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.580 
that's just tall enough to start chowing
up<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.489> string<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.659> you<00:03:21.750> see<00:03:21.959> right<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.440> is

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
up this string so you see right here is

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.530 
up this string so you see right here is
the<00:03:22.739> main<00:03:22.950> chute<00:03:23.310> I'm<00:03:23.790> gonna<00:03:23.940> grab<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.329> main

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the main chute I'm gonna grab the main

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.839 
the main chute I'm gonna grab the main
vine<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.959> can<00:03:25.079> see<00:03:25.260> there's<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.849> subtly

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
vine you can see there's the subtly

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.490 
vine you can see there's the subtly
another<00:03:27.090> part<00:03:27.389> of<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.540> plant<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.200> here's<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
another part of the plant but here's the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.069 
another part of the plant but here's the
main<00:03:28.680> vine<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.269> gonna<00:03:30.359> wrap<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
main vine and I'm just gonna wrap the

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.159 
main vine and I'm just gonna wrap the
string<00:03:31.440> around<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:32.609> like<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:33.989> do

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
string around it like this you just do

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.559 
string around it like this you just do
it<00:03:34.260> gently<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:35.489> every<00:03:35.910> few<00:03:36.120> days<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.450> can

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
it gently and every few days you can

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.270 
it gently and every few days you can
come<00:03:36.750> out<00:03:36.780> wrap<00:03:37.290> your<00:03:37.500> plants<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.859> little<00:03:38.069> more

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
come out wrap your plants a little more

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.369 
come out wrap your plants a little more
so<00:03:38.879> just<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.269> just<00:03:39.299> wrapped<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> couple<00:03:40.139> times

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
so just I just wrapped it a couple times

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.949 
so just I just wrapped it a couple times
so<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.310> plant<00:03:41.609> will<00:03:41.819> start<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.450> grow<00:03:42.569> up<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
so that plant will start to grow up that

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.259 
so that plant will start to grow up that
string<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:44.660> start<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.959> make<00:03:46.470> Tomatoes<00:03:47.269> also

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
string and start to make Tomatoes also

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.409 
string and start to make Tomatoes also
gives<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> good<00:03:49.470> idea<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.430> keep<00:03:50.669> what

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
gives you a good idea to keep what

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.869 
gives you a good idea to keep what
you're<00:03:51.599> actually<00:03:51.750> pruning<00:03:52.430> because<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.730> you

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
you're actually pruning because as you

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.990 
you're actually pruning because as you
go<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:55.079> can<00:03:55.769> prune<00:03:56.099> off<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> excess<00:03:56.730> stuff

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
go up you can prune off the excess stuff

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.229 
go up you can prune off the excess stuff
that<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.230> up<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.500> main<00:03:58.650> string
