00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 she greets all the guys that's that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 I hope you have the fishing one gets 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.310
 found today on was 14 for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.110
 open the packs so these sailboats are there 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 a paw there there is a promo a little 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.060
 happy hour packs at 25000 so nothing 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.830
 as players to create your team of 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.630
 dream includes two players at least 10 in 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.340
 gold with three rare so here you have 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.930
 however, since I was 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.400
 multimillionaire with my cristiano 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.050
 ronaldo i really did the con and 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.100
 I fuck all in this pack 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 annoys me and I was doing that to lose to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.410
 rebalancing just like you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.730
 see my balance sheet 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.440
 so I farted a cable open game 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.790
 where all the credits g that shit 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.590
 so in the end I go a little in the ass 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.200
 but I think that good and ben arfa 15 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 is a game I want my departure I 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.450
 still a team with neymar and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.100
 so I'm not at the end either 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.230
 of the roll 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 I dreamed to 15 I left with 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 new teams and so that's me 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 I am in the end I have a little nothing to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 fuck and that cases the happy hours 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.520
 a worry so we go right away 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.320
 start obviously for the first 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.759
 pack with falcao so I really hope 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
