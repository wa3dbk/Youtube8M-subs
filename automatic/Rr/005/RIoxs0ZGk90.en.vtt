00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.460
 today good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.990
 new skin this time it's about eses 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.330
 juani a new is who to play 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.700
 neither play nor knight osuna and good 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.380
 first of all say that I do not know what 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 is happening lately to the server pp 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.900
 that has everything changed so like 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.390
 you see has the voice of the root of the screams 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.130
 of war I can not I can not teach it 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.050
 still in full but well let's 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.350
 take a quick look at what's coming 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.590
 being this new skin that will cost 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.269
 1350 rp so good more or less you can 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 see the movements but as I say what 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:39.680
 that is being the cries of wars 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.530
 it's just this is fine 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.520
 the dance as logically has no voice 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.730
 basically 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.340
 it's the same and the laughs what good 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.150
 again root when you move the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.890
 character that talks about samur I do not know 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.970
 because as I say has this mess the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.920
 pp server if you want to say something like 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.520
 what do you want to leave wrong 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.960
 there you see and then nothing we have already taught 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.180
 the war cries we are going to see a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.979
 little spells but as I say this 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.370
 it's going to be a quick look at the subject 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.100
 how good I said 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.620
 the truth is that being those cries of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.800
 war that way and all that is a 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.050
 little bad here are also seeing the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 passive the auto tags we go to the q 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.590
 this parchment and put it the w 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 there are 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.710
 the e 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.520
 You see that it leaves as if they were mines 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.140
 sorry other than another w 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.859
 you see that I also in the mass as if 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.859
 outside a mine 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.899
 OK 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.899
 and then finally the r 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 let's go to the record a recovery 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.379
 Hahaha 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.730
 I love I love that tip of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.430
 recovery and good finally the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 death as I say I'm very sorry for not 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.840
 to be able to bring what has been the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.940
 entire corner but as you can see 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.580
 completely messed up the files 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160
 It's not my fault, so as I say 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.410
 I am very sorry as soon as I am in 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.350
 How much will I bring back to you? 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.940
 to logically see her because the truth 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.250
 it's painted in a corner very very 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.300
 good so let's see death by 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.650
 latest 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.650
 here is let's see her 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.740
 and nothing like I say when it's full 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 I would bring it back so I hope that 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.930
 you liked it and until the next 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.930
