00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
in battlefield 4 now the stats taken

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
in battlefield 4 now the stats taken
into<00:00:10.349> consideration<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.610> bullet

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
into consideration is the bullet

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.259 
into consideration is the bullet
velocity<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.259> bullet<00:00:13.650> drop<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.340> yes<00:00:15.089> the

velocity and the bullet drop and yes the
bullet<00:00:15.599> drop<00:00:15.900> although<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.650> battlefield<00:00:17.190> 3<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
bullet drop although in battlefield 3 it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.400 
bullet drop although in battlefield 3 it
remained<00:00:18.150> constant<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> sniper

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
remained constant for all the sniper

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.340 
remained constant for all the sniper
rifles<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.520> battlefield<00:00:21.270> 4<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.990> bullet

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
rifles in battlefield 4 the bullet

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.070 
rifles in battlefield 4 the bullet
dropped<00:00:22.710> varies<00:00:23.400> between<00:00:24.150> each<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> guns

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
dropped varies between each of the guns

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.779 
dropped varies between each of the guns
that's<00:00:25.619> why<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> Scout<00:00:26.220> elite<00:00:26.369> which<00:00:26.670> has

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that's why the Scout elite which has

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
that's why the Scout elite which has
been<00:00:26.939> trumpeted<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> best<00:00:27.990> gun<00:00:28.199> really

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
been trumpeted as the best gun really

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.439 
been trumpeted as the best gun really
isn't<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> highest

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
isn't because it has one of the highest

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920 
isn't because it has one of the highest
bullet<00:00:31.260> drops<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:31.740> 15<00:00:32.430> meters<00:00:32.850> per<00:00:33.420> second

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
bullet drops at 15 meters per second

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.930 
bullet drops at 15 meters per second
when<00:00:34.590> compared<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> most<00:00:35.340> other<00:00:35.550> sniper

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
when compared to most other sniper

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.560 
when compared to most other sniper
rifles<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.750> only<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.610> 9.81<00:00:38.610> meters<00:00:39.210> per

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
rifles which only have 9.81 meters per

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.470 
rifles which only have 9.81 meters per
second<00:00:39.930> drop<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.239> with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
second drop so let's get into it with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
second drop so let's get into it with
the<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.840> three<00:00:43.200> coming<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.040> third<00:00:44.280> place

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the top three coming in at third place

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.510 
the top three coming in at third place
is<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> m<00:00:45.149> 98<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> bullet<00:00:47.370> velocity

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
is the m 98 be it has a bullet velocity

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
is the m 98 be it has a bullet velocity
of<00:00:48.200> 650<00:00:49.200> meters<00:00:49.500> per<00:00:49.710> second<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.670> bullet

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
of 650 meters per second and a bullet

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.069 
of 650 meters per second and a bullet
drop<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> 9.81<00:00:52.469> meters<00:00:53.070> per<00:00:53.370> second<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
drop of 9.81 meters per second so the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.639 
drop of 9.81 meters per second so the
accuracy<00:00:55.649> value<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.780> sixty<00:00:57.780> six<00:00:58.170> point<00:00:58.590> three

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
accuracy value is sixty six point three

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
accuracy value is sixty six point three
which<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.000> bullet<00:01:00.359> will<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.719> sixty<00:01:01.260> six

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
which is the bullet will go sixty six

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
which is the bullet will go sixty six
point<00:01:01.829> three<00:01:01.920> meters<00:01:02.550> before<00:01:02.969> dropping<00:01:03.539> one

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
point three meters before dropping one

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.460 
point three meters before dropping one
meter<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> second<00:01:06.090> place<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> my

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
meter now in second place is one of my

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
meter now in second place is one of my
favorite<00:01:07.770> guns<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> srr<00:01:09.090> 61<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.189> has<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.820> bullet

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
favorite guns the srr 61 it has a bullet

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.030 
favorite guns the srr 61 it has a bullet
velocity<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:13.400> 620<00:01:14.400> m/s<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:16.110> bullet<00:01:16.439> drop<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
velocity of 620 m/s and a bullet drop of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.570 
velocity of 620 m/s and a bullet drop of
only<00:01:17.430> six<00:01:18.119> meters<00:01:18.600> per<00:01:18.840> second<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
only six meters per second so the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
only six meters per second so the
accuracy<00:01:21.150> value<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> gun<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
accuracy value for this gun is a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
accuracy value for this gun is a
stifling<00:01:24.409> 103<00:01:25.409> point<00:01:25.770> 3<00:01:26.250> meters<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
stifling 103 point 3 meters so the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
stifling 103 point 3 meters so the
bullet<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.549> travel<00:01:30.200> 103.3<00:01:31.200> meters<00:01:31.680> before

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bullet will travel 103.3 meters before

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.870 
bullet will travel 103.3 meters before
dropping<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.759> single<00:01:33.000> meter<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> insane

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
dropping a single meter that is insane

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
dropping a single meter that is insane
however<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.090> only<00:01:36.360> second<00:01:36.750> place<00:01:36.960> coming<00:01:37.799> in

between<00:01:58.280> xbox<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.460> ps4<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:01.430> bullet

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
between xbox and ps4 it's bullet

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
between xbox and ps4 it's bullet
velocity<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:04.250> 630<00:02:05.250> meters<00:02:06.240> per<00:02:06.479> second<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's bullet drop is only 6 meters per
