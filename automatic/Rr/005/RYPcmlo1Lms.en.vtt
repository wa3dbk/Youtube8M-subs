00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.110
 so sew up dear friends today with you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.480
 arsen this is my next video first 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.530
 today and so today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.100
 everywhere I didn’t cook 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.080
 your bike kick here everything looks on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 street workshop and that's what happened 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:39.180
 there was no one to shoot here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 It turned out such a garbage here the most difficult 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.590
 had to cook in front exactly at normal 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 quarreled for such a single part that's how I 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 did pepper and did you start there 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.090
 turner I gave for all this together with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 traverses i am now almost 2000 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 here I turned the nitrogen here the first pancake 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.580
 lump had to talk tried 2 damn 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.229
 went okay first damn can tilt 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.090
 was to understand what was the fork of that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.070
 Mad me for this made vtyk 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 tilt did a lot less i mean 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.259
 the slope was 120 true now he is somewhere i 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 did not look exactly did not measure 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.409
 the doctor thought that such a crown is quite 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 we have enough pipes 25 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:35.400
 here and here the whole bath for brewed 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.759
 with his welder thigh and because 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 this is the strongest place or I decided 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.619
 to entrust it to the welder 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.750
 But what is easier, that is? 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.270
 your five millimeter plate here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.409
 approaches him exactly in the middle he 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 I am overwhelmed with searching here and now I'm closing 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.680
 I myself have already done clean work 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.619
 here that is 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.959
 painting it certainly far from the whole 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.120
 a month before painting what else a lot 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.030
 wipe it up well in general 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.959
 something like this will be all 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.940
 hard work leaves for 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.790
 a professional welder 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 easy to cook my welding 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.750
 semi-automatic and ordinary brownie here I 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 brewed so that nothing was visible inside 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.580
 the same will happen with the other side brewed 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.690
 so that nothing was visible that's all 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.569
 neatly wiped 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 further here is what else i did ie frame 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.810
 It looks where on the long seems 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:58.500
 as if a double well, well shorter 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:03:01.560
 trick here is the opera similar 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.450
 it turns out we started doing 1 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.180
 motor mount as suddenly I don’t 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.890
 very thick so for this 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.350
 Dnieper motor which weighs almost 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.550
 60 kilograms I am for him 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:22.880
 cut down motorcycles 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:22.880
 That is, it turns out this is the engine compartment for 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.269
 22 of our motorcycle will be a little more well 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:35.600
 not even a little more than two meters between 2 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.600
 and 3 meters so here it looks now 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.230
 everything is perfect exactly the error 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.630
 amounts will not lie 2 millimeters i 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:52.380
 cooked himself then drove it yes yes drove 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.799
 the man who does music and he 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.950
 I measure it all down the slipway to them shorter 2 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:04.310
 millimeter me all errors 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.310
 from the fact that we have these three before 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.570
 plates shaped tube 20 40 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.310
 brewed under the battery and about it 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.109
 let under the box with electronics because 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.820
 anything music air suspension 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.950
 xenon signaling what else for the cube 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.010
 now remember a long time well, in short 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.780
 in full, that's why the connection with this 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.030
 how since i will stuff it and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.190
 minting any garbage here is this place 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 it will not be free it will be all clogged 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.070
 so that there is no advantage of the court and the court 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.160
 There are 60 here and 3020 kilograms in total will be 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.700
 the fish music center is also sealed here 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.930
 and the center of the tape recorder is shorter here it is me 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.390
 tomorrow at the expense since today we 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.390
 Saturday and cook until you can no longer 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.050
 evening and cook all day that's why 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.000
 tomorrow 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.200
 I will also close this side neatly 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 not to be seen 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:11.460
 all the shit shut it down after the day it's still 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.340
 nothing is erased that is when it all 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.230
 I will erase it all will look good and 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.300
 Stalin and I will shoot a video about how I 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:35.400
 that's exactly what i do because i just 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:06:09.810
 there is no one to buy a camera attached 40 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:06:14.570
 20 centimeters and 30 shorter than the length of emotions 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.570
 this is only the frame we now just say 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.020
 plus to go here 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:36.510
 meters and but the forest is our diameter 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:36.510
