 hello guys welcome i am day and in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.680
 this time we have this makeup of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.510
 characterization of a cute zombie 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.210

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.400

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.680
 mort aviv who is one of my characters 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.900
 favorites and after long time of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.809
 Video plans finally we did it 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.769
 I hope you like what you want to go 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.360
 Step by Step 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.060
 we start 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.950
 I previously covered my eyebrows for the part 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.989
 interior to cover them with white color 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.930
 and we are very excited we are 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.020
 premiered skewers with a sponge 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.980
 latex and a little white we're going to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 cover the entire face 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.750
 try to cover everything without leaving 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 traces even the ears 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.230
 I've already covered the whole face up 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.710
 get a result like that let's grab 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.200
 a little purple shadow 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.290
 and we are going to blur the whole face 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.979
 to get a tone very similar to 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.979
 of the tenderloin 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.300
 to get a more similar tone 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's apply some blue that is 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 like a blue like with gray 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.410
 like all over the face 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.180
 and with this we have a very similar tone 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.180
 to slow man 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.800
 with the help of a white pencil we are going to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.800
 delineate the water line 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.510
 now with green shadow and a brush 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.970
 to paint a bit the little bone that is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.190
 above the eye above the mobile eyelid 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.030
 without touching the mobile eyelid there we go to 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.030
 apply another color 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.940
 and now with a light green color 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.940
 let's apply it on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.580
 we are guiding everything by the colors 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.580
 that brings is loin 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.670
 we will occupy this same color in 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.670
 the lips 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.730
 now with the help of a black pencil 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.390
 let's delineate below the eyelashes 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.470
 inferiors just below pegadito and 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 in the superiors 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.810
 and we repeat in the other eye 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.200
 now let's apply a little shadow 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.560
 green also below the delineate that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.560
 we did 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.549
 with the help of a red pencil we are going to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.980
 mark a line between the blue color and 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.260
 the green that we have above and now with 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.750
 a little shadow blue let's mark 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.750
 Eyebrows giving the shape is back 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.070
 we mark our natural eyebrow 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.120
 and in the center we are going to create a curvita 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.120
 that goes up 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.730
 remember that if your eyebrow is not very 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 populated or is clearer is not necessary 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.110
 cover it with glue 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.530
 now with a little purple shadow 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.260
 we are doing a little the shadows that 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.380
 they have the depths and this base of 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.320
 the cheekbones and a bit with the same 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.620
 shadow and a brush let's do it in the 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.620
 nose 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.579
 with the same purple tone we are going to 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:22.419
 make a wash line on the chin 

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:24.279
 It's going to be a split beard and a little 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.349
 the mobile eyelid between the blue color and 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.449
 Green also slightly below 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.309
 the lower lashes to give more 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.309
 depth and more zombie effect 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.930
 remember that you can saturate as much as 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.120
 you want now for the part of the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.740
 hair let's grab a little color 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.410
 blue 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.860
 that it is a little grayish and we are 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.990
 applying it to the sides so that 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.820

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.970

00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:01.210
 It is back and it looks like too had 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:03.100
 to comb myself as lead in this because 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.520
 my hair is very long then 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.979

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.979
