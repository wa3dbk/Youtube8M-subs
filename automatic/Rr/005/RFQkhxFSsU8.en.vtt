00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
computer I watch it sometimes on my what

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
computer I watch it sometimes on my what
do<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.790> say<00:01:59.969> Android<00:02:00.689> phone<00:02:00.930> sometimes<00:02:01.350> on

do you say Android phone sometimes on

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.429 
do you say Android phone sometimes on
the<00:02:01.560> iPad<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> sometimes<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.439> computer

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the iPad and sometimes on the computer

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.240 
the iPad and sometimes on the computer
itself<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.310> makes<00:02:05.579> sense<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.119> load<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
itself so it makes sense to load this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
itself so it makes sense to load this
video<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> NASS<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.149> thereby<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> can

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
video on the NASS and thereby I can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
video on the NASS and thereby I can
basically<00:02:11.069> stream<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> any<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
basically stream it to any of the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.860 
basically stream it to any of the
devices<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.140> let's
