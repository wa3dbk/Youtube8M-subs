00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
 the result of an interaction 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.540
 unexpected between bacteria and currents 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.540
 oceanic 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 for the first time has shown 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 existence of an intriguing interaction 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 between ocean currents and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 bacteria 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.900
 this interaction involves the production 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 of huge amounts of nitrogen in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.870
 the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
 that happens in one of the bodies of water 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.300
 devoid of larger oxygen the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.159
 world and if that were not enough, these areas 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.590
 they are extending 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 this could weaken the capacity 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.460
 of the ocean to absorb dioxide 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.680
 carbon co2 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.420
 and three places in the world harbor 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.909
 large bodies of water essentially 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 devoid of oxygen 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.800
 one of them the biggest is in the ocean 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.190
 Pacific off the coast of Peru and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.590
 chile another of these areas is north 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.800
 from the equator off the coast of Mexico 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.200
 and guatemala and the third place is in the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.710
 Sea of ​​Arabia 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 the three zones but without anoxic oxygen 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.390
 they are like underwater lakes with hardly 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
 contact with the sea ​​water to its 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.239
 around no animal can live in 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 these areas can only inhabit them 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.300
 bacteria that do not need oxygen 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.580
 areas quite worthy of the objective 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.650
 of dead are located at a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 Depth between 100 and 500 meters 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.969
 under the maritime surface 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.269
 in them the microbes produce 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:35.440
 nitrogen gas which is almost 80% 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.320
 of the atmosphere of the earth 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.780
 the team of loreto debrabandere pívot 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.580
 Andrew from the Nordic Studies Center 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.010
 the evolution of the earth in the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.810
 southern university of denmark and its 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.540
 colleagues from the university of conception 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.700
 in chile the university of aarhus in 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.850
 denmark and the aquarium of the bay of 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.130
 monterey in bari in the usa have discovered 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.560
 the exact reason why it occurs 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.050
 nitrogen in such large quantities in 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.670
 the largest of the three areas cited the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.569
 which is located off the coast of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.939
 chile and peru 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.129
 gaseous nitrogen is produced by the 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.469
 stable presence of large populations 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.159
 of bacteria that when fed 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.540
 they generate this gas in huge quantities 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.090
 the bacteria flow with a current 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.380
 oceanic that comes from the equator and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.440
 head to the south pole 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.480
 on its way the bacteria rid the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.580
 ammonia water substance that these 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.610
 consume and from which they release the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.040
 nitrogen in the dead zone investigated 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.290
 in the western Pacific in front of the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.690
 coast of new zealand the heavy waters 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.690
 rich in nutrients sink and start 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.760
 to flow like a submarine current 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.250
 first they circulate towards the equator later 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.290
 along said parallel and then 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.080
 changes course and heads south to 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.940
 Approaching the coasts of South America 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.620
 during this long journey the oxygen 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 disappears from the water and in 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.830
 possibilities of Peru in certain Chile 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.510
 hungry bacteria come into play 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.850
 said bacteria in this stream 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.590
 oceanic from the equator obtain 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.870
 the energy they need to grow at 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.960
 allow the nitrite to react with the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.730
 ammonia and release the nitrogen these 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.980
 bacteria and their impact on the cycle 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.500
 global nitrogen were discovered 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.690
 only a few years ago the scientists 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.640
 are surprised that this guy is 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.710
 of bacteria responsible for the 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.650
 nitrogen production in the gigantic 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.460
 dead zone of the pacific ocean in the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.040
 other areas 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.690
 the research team found that the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.750
 main responsible for production in 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.550
 troje is not another class of bacteria 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.800
 of this class also produce nitrogen 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.410
 but they do it from nitrates and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.900
 nitrites on the occasion of transformations 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.520
 organic matter chemicals not starting 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.130
 of ammonia like bacteria do 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.350
 of the first type in the great dead zone 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.570
 of the Pacific Ocean the bacteria of the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.400
 second type just do not get 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.590
 enough organic food to 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.210
 generate nitrogen so they look 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.400
 overtaken by the bacteria of the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.800
 first type dragged by the waters 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.500
 from the sole the result is that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.060
 these bacteria are the ones that generate almost 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.330
 all the nitrogen gas produced in the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330
 zone
