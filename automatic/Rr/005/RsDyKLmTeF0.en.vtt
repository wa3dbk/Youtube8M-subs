and family cycles now we want to take a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
and family cycles now we want to take a
look<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.210> bicycle<00:00:36.690> pedal<00:00:38.090> many<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.239> us

difficulty with it well let's take a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
difficulty with it well let's take a
critical<00:00:49.829> view<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> takes<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.510> get

critical view of what it takes to get
the<00:00:51.750> job<00:00:51.960> done<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.670> power<00:00:53.969> stroke<00:00:54.510> happens

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the job done the power stroke happens

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.610 
the job done the power stroke happens
when<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> extend<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:56.399> leg<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> pedals

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
when you extend your leg but the pedals

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.639 
when you extend your leg but the pedals
are<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> circle<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
are going around in a circle what is it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.179 
are going around in a circle what is it
that<00:01:01.739> prevent<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.340> foot<00:01:02.550> from<00:01:02.609> slipping<00:01:03.239> off

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
that prevent your foot from slipping off

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.590 
that prevent your foot from slipping off
it<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.400> must<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.670> something<00:01:05.760> because

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it really must be something because

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
it really must be something because
adults<00:01:07.200> generally<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.130> their<00:01:08.400> feet

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
adults generally don't have their feet

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
adults generally don't have their feet
constantly<00:01:09.210> slipping<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> pedals<00:01:10.530> but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
constantly slipping off the pedals but

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.890 
constantly slipping off the pedals but
it's<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> common<00:01:12.240> problem<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.689> early<00:01:13.140> riders

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
it's a common problem for early riders

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's a common problem for early riders
the<00:01:15.900> trick<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> while<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.830> leg<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.369> pushing

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the trick is while one leg is pushing

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.719 
the trick is while one leg is pushing
and<00:01:18.090> providing<00:01:18.930> power<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.130> leg<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and providing power the other leg is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
and providing power the other leg is
pushing<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> wrong<00:01:21.570> direction<00:01:22.790> obviously

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pushing in the wrong direction obviously

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
pushing in the wrong direction obviously
the<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.390> pushing<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> wrong<00:01:25.680> direction

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the one pushing in the wrong direction

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.390 
the one pushing in the wrong direction
isn't<00:01:26.369> exerting<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.000> much<00:01:27.180> force<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
isn't exerting as much force but it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.359 
isn't exerting as much force but it's
still<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> wrong<00:01:30.180> way<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
still going the wrong way it's this

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.020 
still going the wrong way it's this
counter<00:01:32.909> action<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.930> keeps<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.439> feet<00:01:35.030> with

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
counter action that keeps your feet with

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
counter action that keeps your feet with
traction<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.229> slip<00:01:37.500> off<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
traction so that they don't slip off the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.149 
traction so that they don't slip off the
pedal<00:01:38.869> does<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.020> sound<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
pedal does this sound right to you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899 
pedal does this sound right to you
well<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.630> prove<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.220> simply<00:01:44.220> hop<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> bike

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
well I can prove it simply hop on a bike

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.130 
well I can prove it simply hop on a bike
and<00:01:45.149> try<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> pedal<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.560> only<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:47.159> foot<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and try to pedal with only one foot I

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.370 
and try to pedal with only one foot I
guarantee<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.380> cannot<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.220> done<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> think

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
guarantee it cannot be done so think

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.550 
guarantee it cannot be done so think
about<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
about it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.860 
about it
does<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.160> cycling<00:01:56.790> posture<00:01:57.330> this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
does this kind of cycling posture this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.680 
does this kind of cycling posture this
method<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.500> pedaling<00:01:59.150> provide<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.450> most

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
method of pedaling provide the most

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.720 
method of pedaling provide the most
benefit<00:02:01.650> from<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> human<00:02:02.220> body<00:02:02.400> I<00:02:02.930> think<00:02:03.930> not

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
benefit from the human body I think not

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.400 
benefit from the human body I think not
well<00:02:05.730> there<00:02:05.940> are<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:06.360> scholarly<00:02:06.990> arguments

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
well there are some scholarly arguments

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.730 
well there are some scholarly arguments
on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.800> subject<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.430> do<00:02:08.580> believe<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
on the subject I do believe that the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.500 
on the subject I do believe that the
best<00:02:10.980> way<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> pedal<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> bicycle<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.360> by

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
best way to pedal a bicycle is by

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.610 
best way to pedal a bicycle is by
mounting<00:02:13.020> your<00:02:13.140> foot<00:02:13.410> directly<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> pedal

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
mounting your foot directly to the pedal

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.840 
mounting your foot directly to the pedal
this<00:02:16.620> gives<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.980> totally<00:02:17.310> different<00:02:17.610> feel<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this gives a totally different feel to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.630 
this gives a totally different feel to
your<00:02:18.150> bike<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.590> become<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
your bike you become one with the

your bike you become one with the
machine<00:02:21.560> there<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.590> no<00:02:22.830> opportunity<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.760> your

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
4G of the ability to now cycle with only

4G of the ability to now cycle with only
one<00:02:31.410> foot<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:35.040> does<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.310> accomplish

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
one foot so what does this accomplish

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.450 
one foot so what does this accomplish
your<00:02:37.140> feet<00:02:37.410> will<00:02:37.620> never<00:02:37.710> slide<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.250> by

if you want use more muscles in your
legs<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.900> pedal<00:02:46.140> cycle<00:02:46.530> around<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
legs as the pedal cycle around in the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.540 
legs as the pedal cycle around in the
circle

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
circle

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.190 
circle
you<00:02:47.850> still<00:02:48.060> gets<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> biggest<00:02:48.540> benefit<00:02:49.050> when

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
you still gets the biggest benefit when

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
you still gets the biggest benefit when
you<00:02:49.320> kick<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.130> extend<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.550> leg<00:02:50.760> but

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you kick down and extend your leg but

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.750 
you kick down and extend your leg but
now<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:52.410> your<00:02:52.680> pedal<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.160> Mountain<00:02:53.580> your

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
now because your pedal is Mountain your

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
now because your pedal is Mountain your
foot<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.090> mounted<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> pedal<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.020> can

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
foot is mounted to the pedal you can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.950 
foot is mounted to the pedal you can
kick<00:02:55.800> backwards<00:02:56.430> at<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.670> bottom<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.480> lift<00:02:57.750> up

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
kick backwards at the bottom you lift up

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.260 
kick backwards at the bottom you lift up
in<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.040> kick<00:02:59.310> forward<00:02:59.340> at<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> top

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
in the back and kick forward at the top

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.780 
in the back and kick forward at the top
so<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> really<00:03:01.860> strong<00:03:01.920> motion<00:03:02.550> go<00:03:02.700> all

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
so you get a really strong motion go all

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.590 
so you get a really strong motion go all
the<00:03:02.910> way<00:03:02.940> around

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the way around

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.800 
the way around
I<00:03:03.709> mean<00:03:04.709> sure<00:03:05.610> kicking<00:03:06.209> down<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
I mean sure kicking down is the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.050 
I mean sure kicking down is the
strongest<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.770> why<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.640> best<00:03:08.670> of

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
strongest but why not make the best of

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.770 
strongest but why not make the best of
all<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.450> muscles<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.930> your<00:03:09.989> legs<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.630> way

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
all the muscles in your legs the way

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.449 
all the muscles in your legs the way

clipless<00:04:23.010> pedals<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:24.770> after<00:04:25.770> those<00:04:25.950> initial

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
clipless pedals but after those initial

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.240 
clipless pedals but after those initial
training<00:04:26.940> you'll<00:04:27.780> rarely<00:04:28.020> ever<00:04:28.350> fall<00:04:28.710> again

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
training you'll rarely ever fall again

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.700 
training you'll rarely ever fall again
the<00:04:29.610> trick<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:30.060> ten<00:04:30.840> feet<00:04:31.110> before<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.440> come<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
the trick is ten feet before you come to

the trick is ten feet before you come to
a<00:04:31.890> stop<00:04:32.220> just<00:04:32.550> disengage<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:33.870> Coast<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.010> rest

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
a stop just disengage and Coast the rest

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.330 
a stop just disengage and Coast the rest
away<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.700> then<00:04:35.850> break<00:04:36.860> if<00:04:37.860> you<00:04:38.130> have<00:04:38.310> a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
away and then break if you have a

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.890 
away and then break if you have a
tricycle<00:04:39.060> or<00:04:39.560> quadricycle<00:04:40.590> without<00:04:41.460> doubt

tricycle or quadricycle without doubt

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.290 
tricycle or quadricycle without doubt
just<00:04:42.900> use<00:04:43.110> clipless<00:04:43.410> pedals<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.090> no

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
just use clipless pedals you have no

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.100 
just use clipless pedals you have no
fear<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.630> falling<00:04:46.050> over<00:04:46.350> it's<00:04:46.860> not<00:04:47.040> possible

fear of falling over it's not possible

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.430 
fear of falling over it's not possible
plus<00:04:49.610> it's<00:04:50.610> even<00:04:51.030> safer<00:04:51.450> for<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.810> because

off and then your legs or feet getting

off and then your legs or feet getting
trapped<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:01.320> concrete<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:02.520> if<00:05:02.610> you're

trapped on the concrete but if you're

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.350 
trapped on the concrete but if you're
clipped<00:05:03.000> in<00:05:03.230> that<00:05:04.230> will<00:05:04.380> never<00:05:04.530> happen

there<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.480> many<00:05:06.660> designs<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:08.040> clipless

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
there are many designs of clipless

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.360 
there are many designs of clipless
pedals<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.120> choose<00:05:09.330> from<00:05:09.600> but<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.650> prefer<00:05:11.130> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
pedals to choose from but I prefer the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.040 
pedals to choose from but I prefer the
types<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.880> afford<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.330> high<00:05:12.540> degree<00:05:12.810> of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
types that afford a high degree of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.580 
types that afford a high degree of
side-to-side<00:05:13.800> twisting<00:05:14.520> motion<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.990> me<00:05:16.140> this

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
side-to-side twisting motion to me this

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.230 
side-to-side twisting motion to me this
is<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.919> most<00:05:17.070> comfortable<00:05:17.520> for<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.850> knee<00:05:18.000> as

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
is the most comfortable for the knee as

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.680 
is the most comfortable for the knee as
you<00:05:18.570> go<00:05:18.810> through<00:05:19.080> your<00:05:19.230> full<00:05:19.470> pedal<00:05:19.830> stroke<00:05:20.690> my

I had to make to my mountain cheese by
cutting<00:05:57.540> off<00:05:57.630> pieces<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.320> tread<00:05:58.680> so<00:05:59.370> that

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
cutting off pieces of that tread so that

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.490 
cutting off pieces of that tread so that
could<00:05:59.700> make<00:05:59.850> a<00:05:59.880> straight<00:06:00.660> line<00:06:00.930> to<00:06:01.470> the
