00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.650 
just a little bit left of the shampoo
but<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:20.160> like<00:04:20.280> honestly<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.820> really<00:04:21.510> just

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
but it's like honestly I really just

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.880 
but it's like honestly I really just
