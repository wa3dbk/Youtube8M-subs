a good and a bad thing I like that the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
a good and a bad thing I like that the
multiplier<00:01:09.119> increases<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.170> picking<00:01:10.560> up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
multiplier increases now by picking up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
but I don't like that your multiplier

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
but I don't like that your multiplier
doesn't<00:01:14.940> reset<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.720> die<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:15.960> feels<00:01:16.410> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
doesn't reset when you die it feels like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380
