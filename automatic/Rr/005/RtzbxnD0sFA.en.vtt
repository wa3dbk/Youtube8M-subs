00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.820
 wanted to talk a little about it is the closing of the door of grace and speech 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.259
 on the plagues the question is the following per person 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.050
 in the time of the plagues they will happen and everyone at the same time 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.720
 and it is this time the door of grace will already be closed 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.109
 How does the former teacher get this interesting question? 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.039
 and the goalkeeper I'm going to get gorgeous for the meeting viewer 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.329
 Chapter 12 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.360
 verses 1 and 2 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.390
 because there men mention jesus light are clear celestial 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.890
 exercising the functions of intersections is that of judge 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.490
 what is going to happen when Christ ends the function to be exercised 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.840
 the functions of interest are judges 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 he will come back this world to get us 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.490
 when he comes back 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.140
 what will happen at the gates of the temple god sanctuary if 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.560
 close 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 This is a symbol that we use to say 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.500
 because 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.820
 by the fact that Christ returns this world to give to each according to his works 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 as matheus asserts there are 7 he also points out that 22 12 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.730
 when chris comes back to give the reward this indicates that the time of 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.040
 Grace, the time to accept salvation is over. 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.200
 then ring 12 1 and 2 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 this next year 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.690
 in that time the prince-believer will rise up the defender of the children 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.640
 of its people 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 and there will be times of trouble 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.520
 which has never happened since I heard in the action 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 or something jesus knew of the heavenly sanctuary 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.760
 the powers of evil and not to persecute the children of God 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.290
 because you of criciÃºma will be more a sanctuary without being in growing for 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.860
 they 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.100
 and says that at the time of leaving 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 denig that the opposition does the examination of order is one of the names of honor of christ 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.720
 though only two that many are asleep when the earth resurrected the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.340
 be 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 Miguel leaves the sanctuary 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.570
 It's jesus coming back 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.990
 and there the dead rise again 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.069
 indeed the bible says that after Christ came out of the heavenly pualo to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.730
 return to this world the door of grace leaves there or to the porte unit of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.369
 salvation will be over 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:19.859
 That's why it brings sinner and friend listener and surfer as long as you're 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.309
 I have to be saved if I call today 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.969
 how to tell the 3 3 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 in the second chain six athletes 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.009
 enjoy the opportunities God gives today 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.879
 and there is little liquidity of a 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.029
 verses and 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.540
 this year this door closing grace 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.230
 when Christ came out of heaven to send this world to seek to give us the reward 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.819
 how he comes to give the reward no longer has a little because it is that grace 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.819
 is available the fact is that it exists would give reward 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.199
 apocalypse 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 Chapter 21 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.260
 the half chapter 22s11 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 apocalypse 22 people 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.789
 continue with the unjust farm and justice 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.869
 I continued with the filthy yet good world. 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.769
 for just cultivation and in the practice of justice 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.989
 the saint continue to sanctify themselves 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.319
 Why does life say that? 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.559
 I had with the end of the continent without world 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.819
 and ju only remained fair because because critically tried all 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.169
 people 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
 and when he came out of the heavenly sanctuary 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.929
 to give the reward each way will start to fall to the plagues 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.429
 on land seven plagues mentioned 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:38.810
 in apocalypse 15 in apocalypse 16 these plagues 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.269
 six of them are symbolic movie literals 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.479
 as we can see in the other program 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.039
 and these pests 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.889
 will fall in different localities of the earth 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:55.040
 these seven plagues are the last seven god's judgments 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.570
 about a community 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.740
 who does not want to depend on their sins 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.050
 and who did not accept the last three scraps of god in apocalypse captors 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.209
 closed 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.699
 so when chris middle of the shrine closes the door of winning be the pole 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.689
 For mercy salvation will end 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.099
 and rates fell in specific places 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.750
 in the world as we can see in the apocalypse 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.199
 chapters 15 16 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.779
 Another question you think you're talking about is end of time. 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:26.460
 such 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 the question is the following those diseases that are appearing 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.020
 It's an end time signal per person 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.999
 What an interesting question, Tito 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.449
 when we analyze the chapters that speak of the signs of the return of Christ 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.430
 especially mateus 24 lucas 21 to other chapters too 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.539
 in lucas 21 people and 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.300
 we realize that really the emergence of ricky new diseases of 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.910
 lines 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.659
 is just one of the signs of the return of Christ 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.150
 in the magazine god is implanting this but it is that christ prophesied 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.509
 here by the carlinda condition of humanity 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.699
 hysteria with trying to convince them as a consequence of our sins for 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.129
 disrespect the laws of nature 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.360
 God has established 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.409
 lucas 21 titus quickly chapter one verse 11 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.490
 this text was written two thousand years ago 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.539
 it looks like it was written yesterday
