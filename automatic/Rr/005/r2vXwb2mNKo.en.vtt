looking at the desktop experience and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.589 
looking at the desktop experience and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.450 
Windows 8 yes there is a desktop on
Windows<00:00:16.109> 8<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.920> people<00:00:17.190> that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Windows 8 for some of you people that

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.400 
Windows 8 for some of you people that
don't<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.140> but<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> bare<00:00:20.640> minimum

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
don't know but it's a bare minimum

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.570 
don't know but it's a bare minimum
desktop<00:00:22.410> that's<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.920> there<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> run

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
desktop that's really there to run

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.630 
desktop that's really there to run
applications<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.990> run<00:00:25.560> natively<00:00:26.310> in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
applications that don't run natively in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.320 
applications that don't run natively in
Metro<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.199> mean<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:29.400> Windows<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
Metro so that could mean that Windows is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
Metro so that could mean that Windows is
looking<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.019> phase<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.189> desktop

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
looking to phase out the desktop

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.440 
looking to phase out the desktop
environment<00:00:33.600> completely<00:00:34.700> maybe<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.300> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
environment completely maybe in not in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.290 
environment completely maybe in not in
this<00:00:36.600> version<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.260> incoming<00:00:38.040> versions<00:00:38.579> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this version but incoming versions we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
this version but incoming versions we
could<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.160> desktop<00:00:41.610> experience

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
could see when the desktop experience

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
could see when the desktop experience
just<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.600> away<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.680> might<00:00:43.860> not

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
