00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello everyone with you channel everything about android 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.059
 and today we will talk about the application 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.219
 which is called al colle free mine 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.320
 case I have a version installed 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.820
 have advanced functionality now i 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.110
 briefly explain why this 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.290
 the application is the application 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.899
 will help you output the incoming bell 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.759
 without minimizing the game there browser that is 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.630
 if you work with some other 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.480
 the application then on top of the application will 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.760
 pop-up window now we move on to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.030
 settings, I will show how this whole thing 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 It looks like it is 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 It is the preview that is under the function in 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.170
 where you can see how to sit 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.220
 will be organized when working for example 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.500
 into browsers and since I have on elji 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.079
 installed 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.120
 similar function then i will demonstrate in 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.270
 the end of the video how it looks on samsung 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.850
 galaxy s i installed the app 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.170
 positioned as an expo model 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.360
 after installation it will be necessary 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.300
 activate this application in 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.540
 uses but maybe she will earn at 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.060
 you and without sex pose that is 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.250
 I have already made a video for one 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.990
 an application that is positioned as 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.530
 module works fine without 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.120
 expositor let's go to the preview here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 the whole thing will look like let's say you 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.860
 working in some kind of application and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.920
 incoming call it will be like this 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.710
 here is a pop-up window in which you can 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.440
 reject answer or mute 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.229
 There are settings on topics you can choose 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.000
 light and dark theme 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.920
 that is, here is such an interesting if u 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.950
 you installed on the smartphone light 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 the theme then the popup window will be here in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 such a dark video for exactly the settings 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.979
 here the principle is 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.689
 tune and nothing can all this business 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.509
 right in real time on 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.610
 construction site to see how this whole thing 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.900
 looks like we will choose a light theme and 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 let's see here I position posted 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.439
 pop-up window in the center and 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.800
 let's see how it will look the business 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.810
 there is a popup 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.600
 will be displayed in the center or 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.570
 below if you ask the appropriate 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.660
 position for this application ie 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.850
 it will look like this than interesting 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.740
 as I said, that will allow to reject 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.660
 answer the bell just without leaving 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.850
 there is no application 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:47.730
 roll up say that let's say I 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.680
 she and lies if i left but as modules 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.550
 way not activated it's all the same 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.010
 the application that was running it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.670
 folded and after activating it all 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 I worked on the Samsung 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.650
 spoke at the end of the video will be seen as 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.950
 this whole thing works like this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.500
 Briefly about the application itself as I have already 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 said that the author is positioned as 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 the module is therefore after if you have x 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.820
 crawl after you install 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.660
 this application will be enough to go 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.790
 in xposed 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 and activate this module and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.730
 reboot smartphone i think it 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.110
 But fans of games or surfing in browsers 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.870
 will this application 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:39.870
 pretty interesting demonstration 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.390
 as I said at the end of the video reference 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.940
 on of the play market and application jump 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.520
 will be in the video description 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:53.190
 so use hope this 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.930
 the app will help you more easily 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.590
 communicate with your android device 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.330
 nice so here you are 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.690
 playing some kind of game will not lose 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.959
 progress or the game will not be there 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.330
 shut off 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.680
 just be able to accept or deactivate 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 reject the incoming call 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.840
 I will end up with this subscribe 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 on the channel leave comments to new 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.660
 meetings and now see 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.660
 a demonstration
