00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the back of this little bolt and then I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.590 
the back of this little bolt and then I
couldn't<00:00:32.099> find<00:00:32.309> exactly<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.090> would<00:00:33.270> fit<00:00:33.480> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
couldn't find exactly what would fit on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.479 
couldn't find exactly what would fit on
this<00:00:33.750> other<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> eleven<00:00:34.829> sixteenth

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this other one but the eleven sixteenth

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
this other one but the eleven sixteenth
which<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.809> close<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.500> get

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
which is about as close as I could get

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.229 
which is about as close as I could get
to<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.770 
to it I'm going to put that on there to
hold<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.760> see<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.000> can't<00:00:43.370> get<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
hold it and then see if I can't get this

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
hold it and then see if I can't get this
bolt<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:47.039> ah<00:00:52.760> there

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
bolt to back out a little bit ah there

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.080 
bolt to back out a little bit ah there
it<00:00:54.539> came<00:00:54.750> too<00:00:54.840> loose<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.469> okay<00:00:55.800> good

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
it came too loose that time okay good

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.189

I'm going to go ahead and just take this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
I'm going to go ahead and just take this
bolt<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.870> may<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

to be holding this main caliper on and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.660 
to be holding this main caliper on and
now<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> treat<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.220> caliper

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
now we're going to treat this caliper

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.490 
now we're going to treat this caliper
just<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> door<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.260> going

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
just like it was a door and we're going

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
just like it was a door and we're going
to<00:01:13.560> try<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.040> swing<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.509> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to try and swing it up it's going to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
to try and swing it up it's going to
hinge<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.820> top<00:01:20.820> bolt<00:01:22.189> we'll

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
hinge up on this other top bolt we'll

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
hinge up on this other top bolt we'll
just<00:01:23.430> swing<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:25.009> make

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just swing it up out of the way make

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490 
just swing it up out of the way make
sure<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.549> pinching<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.500> little

rubber<00:01:29.329> brake<00:01:30.329> hose<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:33.780> won't<00:01:33.990> stay

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
rubber brake hose and then it won't stay

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
rubber brake hose and then it won't stay
up<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:34.890> good<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.610> I've<00:01:35.759> got<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> little

wire just a piece of baling wire I've
got<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.119> place<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.930> top<00:01:40.439> spring<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
got in place up on this top spring and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.600 
got in place up on this top spring and
I'm<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.490> slide<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:43.610> see

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I'm going to just slide that in to see

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
I'm going to just slide that in to see
if<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> camera<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.500> bit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
if I can get it camera up a little bit

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
if I can get it camera up a little bit
of<00:01:46.829> us<00:01:47.119> slide<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> hole<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
of us slide it into that hole with that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
of us slide it into that hole with that
bolt<00:01:50.070> oh<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.329> tie<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
bolt oh and then just tie it up out of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
bolt oh and then just tie it up out of
the<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.220> looks<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the way now it looks like there's just a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.510 
the way now it looks like there's just a
little<00:01:54.420> backing<00:01:54.750> shim<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
little backing shim so we're going to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
little backing shim so we're going to
note<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.380> off

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
note how that's going to go on and off

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
note how that's going to go on and off
because<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.070> believe<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.909> with

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
because I don't believe I have one with

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.649 
because I don't believe I have one with
the<00:02:00.240> new<00:02:00.469> set<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.500> brakes<00:02:01.950> shoes<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.420> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the new set of brakes shoes and then

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
try to flip it out a little bit just try

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.120 
try to flip it out a little bit just try
to<00:04:25.419> remember<00:04:25.780> how<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.110> came<00:04:26.440> out<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.889> I'll<00:04:26.950> try

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
to remember how it came out and I'll try

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.400 
to remember how it came out and I'll try
to<00:04:27.190> push<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.580> back<00:04:27.729> in<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.150> same<00:04:28.360> way<00:04:28.630> and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
to push it back in that same way and

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.020 
to push it back in that same way and
it's<00:04:29.560> got<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> little<00:04:29.889> backing<00:04:30.190> plate<00:04:30.639> another

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
it's got a little backing plate another

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
it's got a little backing plate another
little<00:04:31.330> clip<00:04:31.570> up<00:04:31.750> here<00:04:32.020> we'll<00:04:32.200> do<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.500> same

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
little clip up here we'll do the same

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.219 
little clip up here we'll do the same
thing<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.250> then<00:04:34.120> we'll<00:04:34.300> pull<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:34.720> clip<00:04:35.020> out

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
thing and then we'll pull this clip out

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.010 
thing and then we'll pull this clip out

there get that backside on and then try
to<00:05:20.640> get<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:21.880> front<00:05:22.240> yeah<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:23.380> popped<00:05:23.710> right

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
to get that front yeah that popped right

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.620 
to get that front yeah that popped right
in<00:05:24.130> there

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
in there

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.550 
in there
now<00:05:25.630> this<00:05:25.960> next<00:05:26.230> shoe<00:05:27.480> as<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:28.690> recall<00:05:29.169> it<00:05:29.530> was

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
now this next shoe as I recall it was

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.390 
now this next shoe as I recall it was
rotated<00:05:30.520> let's<00:05:31.150> see<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:35.290> can't<00:05:35.650> go<00:05:35.860> no<00:05:36.130> other

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
rotated let's see it can't go no other

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.180 
rotated let's see it can't go no other
way<00:05:36.700> then<00:05:37.060> with<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.450> backing<00:05:37.690> plate<00:05:38.169> on<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
way then with the backing plate on the

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.330 
way then with the backing plate on the
outside<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.590> we<00:05:41.590> got<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:41.950> get<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.220> in<00:05:42.370> here

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.430 

there<00:05:48.340> got<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.060> top<00:05:49.390> in<00:05:49.630> first<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.169> seemed

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
there got the top in first that seemed

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.290 
there got the top in first that seemed
to<00:05:50.560> do<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.770> trick

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
to do the trick

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.600 
to do the trick
now<00:05:52.300> this<00:05:52.650> little<00:05:53.650> piston<00:05:54.070> is<00:05:54.220> going<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.430> have

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
now this little piston is going to have

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.909 
now this little piston is going to have
to<00:05:54.760> be<00:05:54.910> compressed<00:05:55.330> try<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.290> get<00:05:56.470> me<00:05:56.620> an<00:05:56.770> old

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
to be compressed try and get me an old

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.650 
to be compressed try and get me an old
brake<00:05:57.280> shoe<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.729> put<00:05:57.880> on<00:05:58.030> here<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.330> then<00:05:58.510> get

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
brake shoe and put on here and then get

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.960 
brake shoe and put on here and then get
a<00:05:58.690> clamp<00:05:59.140> now<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.010> don't<00:06:00.280> want<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.550> pinch<00:06:00.760> your

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
a clamp now you don't want to pinch your

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.850 
a clamp now you don't want to pinch your
hose<00:06:01.210> line<00:06:01.600> or<00:06:01.840> anything<00:06:02.020> like<00:06:02.350> that<00:06:02.620> back

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
hose line or anything like that back

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.409 
hose line or anything like that back
over<00:06:03.160> here<00:06:03.310> we<00:06:03.430> just<00:06:03.640> get<00:06:03.789> it<00:06:03.880> on<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.030> regular

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
over here we just get it on a regular

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.029 
over here we just get it on a regular
flat<00:06:04.720> piece<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.050> that<00:06:05.350> back<00:06:05.560> side<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:05.919> that

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
flat piece of that back side of that

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.670 
flat piece of that back side of that
piston<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.789> then<00:06:07.539> try<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:07.930> clamp<00:06:08.200> this<00:06:08.440> and

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
piston and then try and clamp this and

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.330 
piston and then try and clamp this and
squeeze<00:06:09.010> it<00:06:09.220> on<00:06:09.340> down<00:06:10.710> let<00:06:11.710> me<00:06:11.830> get<00:06:11.950> my<00:06:12.070> clamp

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
squeeze it on down let me get my clamp

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.390 
squeeze it on down let me get my clamp
set<00:06:12.669> up<00:06:12.990> now<00:06:13.990> we're<00:06:14.200> trying<00:06:14.410> to<00:06:14.560> slowly<00:06:14.979> turn

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
set up now we're trying to slowly turn

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.790 
set up now we're trying to slowly turn
this<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.650> get<00:06:17.890> that<00:06:18.130> piston<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.840> seat<00:06:20.500> back

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
this and get that piston to seat back

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.680 
this and get that piston to seat back
down<00:06:20.830> there

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
down there

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.270 
down there
okay<00:06:22.690> now<00:06:22.870> hopefully<00:06:23.140> you<00:06:23.440> can<00:06:23.560> see<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:24.070> that

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
okay now hopefully you can see that that

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.670 
okay now hopefully you can see that that
breaks<00:06:24.850> you<00:06:25.030> now<00:06:25.300> has<00:06:25.479> just<00:06:25.780> flushed<00:06:26.200> out<00:06:26.470> with

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
breaks you now has just flushed out with

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.430 
breaks you now has just flushed out with
the<00:06:26.800> housing<00:06:27.250> of<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.520> piston<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:29.080> can<00:06:29.229> see

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
the housing of the piston you can see

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.500 
the housing of the piston you can see
now<00:06:29.620> this<00:06:29.860> piston<00:06:30.310> has<00:06:30.460> been<00:06:30.640> pushed<00:06:30.970> in<00:06:31.150> level

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
now this piston has been pushed in level

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.710 
now this piston has been pushed in level
with<00:06:31.630> this<00:06:31.810> little<00:06:32.140> housing<00:06:32.590> and<00:06:33.310> so<00:06:33.550> now<00:06:34.539> I'm

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
with this little housing and so now I'm

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560 
with this little housing and so now I'm
going<00:06:34.870> to<00:06:34.930> go<00:06:35.080> ahead<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:35.560> take<00:06:36.520> this<00:06:36.729> bailing

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
going to go ahead and take this bailing
