at the box there isn't a great deal of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.690 
at the box there isn't a great deal of
detail<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.159> fairly<00:01:20.340> plain

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

but what they do state is that it's
going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.400> ddr3<00:01:24.060> support<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.630> we'd

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
going to have ddr3 support which we'd

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.560 
going to have ddr3 support which we'd
expect<00:01:25.259> anyway<00:01:25.640> you've<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.790> compatibility

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
expect anyway you've got compatibility

with<00:01:27.600> windows<00:01:27.750> 7<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> norton<00:01:29.549> budget

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
with windows 7 and the norton budget

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
with windows 7 and the norton budget
though<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.299> i<00:01:30.360> presume<00:01:30.570> you've<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.590> internet

user so we're going to be able to tweak

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
user so we're going to be able to tweak
those<00:01:47.189> settings<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.970> easy<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.720> hopefully

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
those settings really easy and hopefully

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039 
those settings really easy and hopefully
get<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> clock<00:01:49.710> speeds<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:51.049> opening

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
get the clock speeds right up opening

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
get the clock speeds right up opening
the<00:01:52.170> box<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.649> we've<00:01:52.799> got<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.159> board<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.790> an

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the box then we've got the board in an

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
the box then we've got the board in an
anti-static<00:01:54.329> bag<00:01:56.960> take<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> closer<00:01:58.380> look<00:01:58.500> at

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
anti-static bag take a closer look at

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.670 
anti-static bag take a closer look at
that<00:01:58.860> later<00:01:59.509> we've<00:02:00.509> got<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:00.990> serial<00:02:01.409> ATA

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
that later we've got two serial ATA

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
that later we've got two serial ATA
cables<00:02:03.920> I've<00:02:04.920> got<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> driver<00:02:05.430> disk<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> yeah

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
cables I've got the driver disk and yeah

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.690 
cables I've got the driver disk and yeah
it<00:02:06.329> does<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.780> norton<00:02:07.560> internet<00:02:07.799> security<00:02:08.099> on
