00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello to all girls very short video o 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.090
 first of all to let you know that I am 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.550
 still alive so I'm a bit gone 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.410
 from the channel because we are really layer is 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.340
 busy as I register on 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.020
 Facebook 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.419
 all those who follow me there too 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.369
 they will know this will be a very short video 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.779
 update because in fact they are 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.669
 managed to cut the hair too 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.650
 made a color a little details then 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.079
 loved me to share this with 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.790
 you to make you a bit to see if ye 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.670
 to know even if you like them no 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.990
 then it was from so much wine to cut the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.450
 hair because he had in mind of 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.910
 to grow back pro so I really am 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.220
 many months have passed since the last one 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.080
 time when I cut them and finally 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.060
 let's say let's say the time has come 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.590
 however to give us a cut and to give 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.450
 however a systematization also because 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.070
 in the last period I felt a bit like one 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.130
 little goat where very own hair 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.520
 messy and therefore precisely as a change 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.900
 I tried to keep the length ha 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.479
 better defined the tube than you can 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.780
 see is rather scaled and of course 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.670
 I also ticked slightly likud e 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.140
 totally scaled hair in the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.299
 highest part to give a little bit of 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.189
 volume seen anyone I have a lot of hair 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.469
 smooth so they tend to flatten out 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.119
 very much while regarding the 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.740
 so many color of you often me 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.749
 they ask for more color and colors are i 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.420
 my hair what color I do and myself 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:32.049
 basically let's say I already have mine 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.719
 a natural basis therefore what has gods 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.640
 gold reflections satri echo and therefore I have 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.009
 always used these shades of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.990
 color or a mahogany brown then 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.030
 slightly pink to reddish 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.649
 or it is precisely the reds, however 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.380
 Milan will say much more about the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.139
 purple is much less towards the red more 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.630
 hot rossorame because I find it anyway 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:54.609
 that they are even better with better with the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.950
 my skin color with my shade 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.509
 of the face and this time precisely I have 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.039
 redone over the entire length of the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.460
 hair if for a sort of red headphone 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.869
 purple, however, to give some movement 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.360
 td is a little bit lacking in everything I lighthouse 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.280
 asks some recipes made 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 seen tv then a kind of rose 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.110
 violet a little lighter 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.459
 I hope you see in camera with in 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.130
 this is our full length 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.890
 hair and just to make everything a 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.560
 a little bit more even a little more youthful a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.520
 slightly livelier a little more lively and 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.319
 also because strips a little more 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.600
 car clear these games a little bit more 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.100
 plans however still give a little more a 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.870
 a little more movement than my hair 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.110
 I repeat, they have succeeded by now 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.489
 you will know very well then nothing 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 I'm glad it's a color that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.870
 i enjoy canine miles so know if 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.360
 you too like everyday bicolor o 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.810
 if you still like me anyway 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.370
 these shades a bit precisely that they turn 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.769
 on purple red with regard to i 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.360
 hair and you before concluding this 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.550
 very short video I wanted to talk to you too 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.500
 of two products that underlie and that me 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.769
 i really really like it in the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.390
 sense that he had been thinking of for a while 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.549
 try the products for hair and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.900
 sense I leave shampoo and conditioner e 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.670
 I must say that I am finding myself with these 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.650
 really I wanted you very well 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.290
 talk about it and maybe give it some 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.200
 continue more then they are like shampoo it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.850
 shampoo all the fruits that is this one 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.250
 and it is indeed a shampoo with a lot of touches 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 to greasy hair, which however tends to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.600
 thank you I especially if not 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.430
 have the skin very very grateful and this 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.500
 as the description says and the shampoo 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.750
 tropical taste to squeeze the hair 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.239
 fats with all the libya of nature 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.030
 with you with papaya mangwana fresh 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.769
 born kiwi to clean thoroughly and ingenious 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.450
 to do it gently 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.850
 I must say that I like it a lot 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.769
 I was the first thing very much 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.989
 hit between the consistency of the shampoo 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.030
 because it is very dense and looks almost like one 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.890
 fruit puree 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.880
 so it's not really in the victim we create 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.680
 a kind of tour and a lot 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.080
 liquid fruit and not like it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.670
 apply to hair because it looks like 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.600
 just about shampooing with 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.460
 past fruit is the scent is very good 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.230
 because it really smells like fruit 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.570
 very very strong and very intense and 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.610
 nice and cleans a lot when mine 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.010
 hair without excessive degreasing 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.420
 which often happens with hair with 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.400
 shampoos for hair because grateful 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.830
 they go to excessively clean the skin 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.480
 then next day it seems almost back 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.140
 dirty because it's leather anyway 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.670
 the scalp that comes 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.070
 excessively released goes to produce 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.690
 even more sebum while this is a show 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.340
 which cleans well but very well 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.110
 delicate and this is something that I ta 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.150
 that beckons a lot 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.780
 I want to test it much longer 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.310
 because I want to see if indeed 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.960
 don't go over time instead to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.180
 scratch too much but for the moment 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.730
 I'm really very happy with it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.440
 this product the hair remains 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.110
 cleaned even for three days and for me it is 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.780
 really a wonderful thing and then 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.020
 perfume remains intense right on 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.510
 hair and the second product I am 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.790
 using this balm instead 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.070
 call it diligence and the balm that you 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.720
 this point also stands out due to lack of mandate 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.970
 to all types of hair then 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.160
 however very delicate and has a scent 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.530
 heavenly because it contains handle 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.060
 fresh strawberries and honey to sweeten 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.340
 all hair types 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.500
 the scent is really delicious 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.210
 wonderful is obviously I apply it 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.280
 only on this part of the hair then 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.350
 on the lengths and I must say that it makes them 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.650
 really very soft if you say they seem 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.720
 almost z and does not go heavy because 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.520
 often some hops tend to atc 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.440
 Carli point out all the hair between 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.660
 them creating a greasy effect indeed 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.610
 terrible while in this case it was 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.100
 it is enough and maximum that false work said 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.530
 that hair makes smooth bites and lights 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.910
 and shiny but no more so not in 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.040
 exaggerated manner 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.050
 so really not finding much 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.580
 the votes go well with both products 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.290
 bertolini are still full because 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.840
 really a very small walnut of 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.570
 product if to shampoo all the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.670
 hair is still to recall the 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.530
 tips therefore even if the jars are 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.060
 little ones I'm sure they 'll have to 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.000
 really a lot because they are used 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.790
 just very little product every two three 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.060
 days so I have to say that from this 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.860
 point of view according to me they are though 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.930
 they cost a little bit but in the end the 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.430
 product certainly lasts in lugo e 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.870
 so nothing I wanted to do just me 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.130
 seems like a group of these two primates 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.900
 productive even if you give it some 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.730
 I recommend more if maybe you too 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.860
 like me you have this type of 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.870
 very smooth thin hair that stretches 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.560
 to fatten up to weigh down his chest 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.820
 I hope behind avoided useful and nothing like 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.860
 I always wait for your comments 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.660
 let me know if you like this cut 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.160
 this color 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.410
 you know yours are my pleasure 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.700
 opinions also however critical to 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.890
 criticisms are constructive 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.020
 I remind you that is about to expire you 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.520

 almost in the water it has a lot effect 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.290
 fresh and able to make up perfectly 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:19.490
