the last couple of games they got bored

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.869 
the last couple of games they got bored
with<00:03:05.620> our<00:03:05.830> submission<00:03:06.250> system<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.670> had

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
with our submission system we had

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.670 
with our submission system we had
implemented<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.959> now<00:03:08.049> we've<00:03:08.200> got<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> brand<00:03:08.560> new

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
implemented so now we've got a brand new

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.350 
implemented so now we've got a brand new
submission<00:03:09.069> system<00:03:09.159> in<00:03:09.340> place<00:03:09.459> we've<00:03:10.209> got

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
submission system in place we've got

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.030 
submission system in place we've got
super<00:03:10.629> sorry<00:03:10.840> Pacific<00:03:11.140> comebacks<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.829> are
