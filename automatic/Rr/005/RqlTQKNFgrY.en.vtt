00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello everybody 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.679
 I promised a while ago 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.469
 that it's still a video shoot like mine 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.320
 Nails lay so well that it was days too 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.699
 lasts for a long time or weeks and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.050
 now something funny happen one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.850
 followed the same service as yesterday 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
 hopes to put online but not done 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.580
 because I thought it was funny that one 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.349
 other person under the nails video 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.719
 wrote that she tried it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.930
 and it does not work for him 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 does because you watch him always seen has 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 which I found quite funny because I have 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.899
 exactly in this video I am in a position 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 canceled and I still have this one 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.280
 times up made with a new technology 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 So you just can not do the transition 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 I thought it was cool because of that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.600
 I did that again now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 So as I speak and I said 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 as was now the video how here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.329
 I really want to be able to recognize my situation 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.229
 just do not grow report rather always 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.270
 maybe he has to catch up 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 Anyway, another nail looks like that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.659
 we can see from the one we see 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.290
 no longer transition it is just beautiful 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 smooth and has no longer hawk one long 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 in itself is already grown great so 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 as you can see my nail is already 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.479
 almost as long as the tip of course 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.009
 Great when I turn it off 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.009
 Again, you do not see him 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.409
 the next step is looking for ours 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.600
 nail from the course perfect on the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.550
 Take care of other nail 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.460
 little glue, and then get him 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.770
 Thinking about our nail they think 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.260
 that makes a nail bed until the middle of august 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.090
 Press firmly firmly so that there is none 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.820
 more air is when stuck 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.560
 that would have to look something like this 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.660
 of course you can see him 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.700
 but immediately it is negotiating an opel 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.920
 of course, that has to go away and that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.619
 Let's do it the way we take ourselves 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.530
 so essens studio nils balls then 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.479
 let's go that is now 3 1 there does both 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.360
 the art long gone as the glue 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 and also the nail polish itself 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.119
 So we used one of us 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 cotton pads do something on it 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.709
 all men with and then go over the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.300
 art painter over 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.060
 that's why I think that's you too 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.220
 please to the middle of the actual 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.930
 nail bed on it always sticks with it 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 have a little stop the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.230
 nail polish remover now removes the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.480
 nail and so we create one 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.910
 beautiful white passed over here 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 you can really see that the nail 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.720
 now on a level 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.880
 we have no transition no hawk-eye 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 nothing is just a super 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.720
 soft transition 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.450
 After we did that , we fall ours 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.590
 close to as it wishes 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.360
 how could i see it a bit 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.360
 top but that's up to you 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.870
 then we take our base nail polish 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.730
 this gene is leaked in two 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.800
 steps split a new base 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 nail polish I apply now and 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.810
 then let it dry super well 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.040
 and then comes the top nail polish Roman 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.230
 the top nail polish will be twice 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.810
 So please apply thinly once 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.000
 Apply to dry and then apply 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.230
 second time 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.660
 Please do not forget that we are at the front 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.519
 The top one too long is so great 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.500
 important so that the nail polish not synonymous 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 peels off or skips whatever 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.510
 when it is dry we paint ourselves 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.780
 our beautiful new nails color 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.769
 of course leave it to you 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.510
 Again, you should get back to it 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.930
 think that he is also in the lead at the top 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.269
 again appeal go here even from a 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.769
 side you know squat from above too 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.110
 not so the have a wonderful 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.660
 transition and the front is the tip too 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.920
 have been painted again with the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.280
 January nail polish is sitting 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.400
 two days later, ninth january sits 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.970
 everything is still perfect 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 Super tenth only it still 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.920
 perfect tenth tenth 10th 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.290
 as always on the 11th of january it starts slowly 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.109
 on 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.039
 So it starts slowly at the tip it will 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.430
 a little bit it colors a bit 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.860
 gone 24 january no change always 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.370
 still the same little discoloration 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.400
 wear and tear again 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.930
 even before fifteen january do not know 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.070
 if I can see that, we'll go 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.169
 Now you see it on it 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.250
 my nail will be slow because it 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:49.009
 here in front but it does not split from 15 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.999
 january sixteenth january the same 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.919
 it wears on the front off the others have 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.580
 already painted again but this one 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.319
 not I hope you can recognize that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.080
 seventeenth year only end terrain here 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.369
 Last day definitely you can see the tip 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.939
 but already very German 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:11.629
 it wears out more and more but it 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:14.659
 would be still wearable so I mean mine 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.719
 he does not play for it 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.169
 small killings loki sees are there 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.779
 only as a being has that is really great 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.460
 he simply explains it to you 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.930
 half of trading then he does it with 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.139
 The saying can also be gone again 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.770
 so that you have a gentle transition yes 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.620
 then top and base airways and tap like it 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.419
 go anna grÃ¶ver if you want to mark 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.729
 and good is the hold 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.759
 for months now I have it at some point from 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.289
 made because they have grown out 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.419
 So you know that so many of you 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.969
 know yes the video with the go nails 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.159
 and the tips were super small 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.439
 Now my nails are much longer 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.999
 has just grown out and 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.919
 so simply pointless that's why I have 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.360
 not demolished but with the 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.599
 lay further away made 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.949
 I have the names so dissolved the 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.789
 two handlebars not broken at all 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.789
 gone because really always very much 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:15.409
 hard and super groomed be great 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:17.120
 out and yes so I feel and if 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.039
 you do it makes the nail polish 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.469
 further away the nail 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.689
 so the art nail with it the avengers 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.430
 The problem is that it breaks down and one 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.899
 probably still broken on the nail bed 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.399
 that's it 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.289
 I hope I liked it if so 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.919
 then thumbs up and we see the 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.919
 not to 1
