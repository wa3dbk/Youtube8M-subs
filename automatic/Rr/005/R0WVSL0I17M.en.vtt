00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that that this is a serious car and a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
that that this is a serious car and a
lot<00:02:01.830> more<00:02:01.860> serious<00:02:02.400> than<00:02:02.490> people<00:02:02.820> believe<00:02:03.150> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
lot more serious than people believe and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.530 
lot more serious than people believe and
I<00:02:04.380> remember<00:02:05.310> Dennis<00:02:05.520> cocky<00:02:05.970> telling<00:02:06.270> me<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I remember Dennis cocky telling me to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
I remember Dennis cocky telling me to
that<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> times<00:02:07.080> at<00:02:07.290> Laguna<00:02:07.560> Seca<00:02:07.619> were<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that the times at Laguna Seca were a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.270 
that the times at Laguna Seca were a
minute<00:02:08.880> 20<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.170> dp's<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.770> around<00:02:11.009> there

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
minute 20 and the dp's are around there

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.930 
minute 20 and the dp's are around there
so<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.350> serious<00:02:13.560> car<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.700> think

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so it is it's a serious car and I think

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.490 
so it is it's a serious car and I think
there's<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.420> much<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:16.350> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
there's going to be much more of a
