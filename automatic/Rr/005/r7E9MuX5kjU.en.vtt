GPS mode over here will switch to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.490 
GPS mode over here will switch to
altitude<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.159> put<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> middle<00:01:20.330> okay<00:01:21.500> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
altitude if I put in the middle okay and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
altitude if I put in the middle okay and
then<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.860> push<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> way<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:23.689> the

then if I push it all the way down the
switch<00:01:25.080> over<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:27.299> will<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.799> altitude

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
switch over here it will go to altitude

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
switch over here it will go to altitude
so<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> want<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> switch<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.720> manual

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so if you want to switch that to manual

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
so if you want to switch that to manual
you<00:01:31.890> could<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.939> by<00:01:33.150> dragging<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you could do that just by dragging it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.020 
you could do that just by dragging it
down<00:01:35.270> okay<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.829> manual<00:01:38.400> mode<00:01:38.729> okay

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
down okay so now I have manual mode okay

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
down okay so now I have manual mode okay
so<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> switch<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
they'll say I could do so altitude

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.160 
they'll say I could do so altitude
failsafe<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> also<00:01:44.850> activate<00:01:45.360> your

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
failsafe you can also activate your

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.370 
failsafe you can also activate your
intelligent<00:01:47.130> orientation<00:01:47.759> control<00:01:48.380> before

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
intelligent orientation control before

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.730

guys that's how you activate your

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
guys that's how you activate your
failsafe<00:01:54.810> mode
