00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 hi friends with you orton group for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.449
 classic 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.109
 and today we have in principle according to plan 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 assembly I warn you immediately that the machine 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.320
 everything is already painted but by color we are with you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.930
 talk later today we'll just go 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.150
 and today 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.620
 we will collect the car if the dough 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.620
 we start car assembly 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.690
 not 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.690
 there 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.390
 I have already said that the front of the 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.880
 grille will sneak in matt black 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.510
 also i have holes for deflectors 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.700
 air ducts 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.470
 pay attention to clearance and rear 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.060
 door to the gaps between the door and the threshold 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.080
 the doors with what we do not stand 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.200
 sealer well, so the pieces are locks 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.479
 everything fits together everything closes perfectly 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 in my opinion the gap turned out even 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 less than at the factory 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.040
 the car is waiting 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.130
 polishing after polishing I thought we still 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.410
 take pictures note that 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.320
 here the lack of light the camera cannot 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 hand over all the car paint but 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.570
 believe me on the word that the machine has 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.630
 I have a very red three of you 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.540

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.159

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.609

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.230

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:38.370
 the gaps between the wing and the door and now I 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.370
 turn to the gap between the door and the threshold 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.750

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.569
