need<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> install<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> secondary<00:00:32.430> turn

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
need to install the secondary turn

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.790 
need to install the secondary turn
signal<00:00:33.510> relay<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.110> right<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> turn

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
signal relay so right now the turn

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:47.299 
signal relay so right now the turn
signals<00:00:35.600> don't<00:00:36.600> work<00:00:40.760> what's<00:00:41.760> open<00:00:45.289> sit<00:00:46.309> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
signals don't work what's open sit so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.610 
signals don't work what's open sit so
right<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> turn<00:00:47.850> signals<00:00:51.230> you<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> use

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
right now the turn signals you go to use

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.830 
right now the turn signals you go to use
them<00:00:52.860> just

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.170

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
that's it that's all they do they when

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.469 
that's it that's all they do they when
they're<00:01:05.269> working<00:01:05.420> its<00:01:05.750> beam<00:01:06.020> me<00:01:06.830> beep<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:08.000> if

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
they're working its beam me beep now if

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.170 
they're working its beam me beep now if
i<00:01:08.659> unplug<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.290> rear<00:01:09.470> ones<00:01:09.710> they<00:01:09.979> work<00:01:10.220> you

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
i unplug the rear ones they work you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.880 
i unplug the rear ones they work you
tried<00:01:11.420> adding<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:11.930> line<00:01:12.140> extra<00:01:12.979> resistors<00:01:13.640> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
tried adding in line extra resistors and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.410 
tried adding in line extra resistors and
it<00:01:15.890> was<00:01:16.100> worse<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:17.210> actually<00:01:17.420> needs<00:01:19.420> less

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
it was worse it actually needs less

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.200 
it was worse it actually needs less
resistance<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.229> more<00:01:21.500> which<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.130> weird<00:01:22.340> so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
resistance not more which is weird so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.440 
resistance not more which is weird so
we're<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:23.659> going<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> secondary<00:01:25.850> relay

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
we're just going to do a secondary relay

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.899 
we're just going to do a secondary relay
in<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.869> back<00:01:27.050> with<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.830> liar<00:01:28.070> straight<00:01:28.729> into

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
in the back with a liar straight into

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.889 
in the back with a liar straight into
the<00:01:28.940> battery<00:01:30.700> connect<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.780> know

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
the battery connect it to that you know

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.389 
the battery connect it to that you know
we'll<00:01:33.050> just<00:01:33.080> we'll<00:01:33.470> do<00:01:33.590> some<00:01:33.770> splicing<00:01:34.250> I

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
we'll just we'll do some splicing I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.219 
we'll just we'll do some splicing I
don't<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.270> anything<00:01:35.479> about<00:01:35.600> electricals<00:01:36.110> oh

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
don't know anything about electricals oh

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.160 
don't know anything about electricals oh
well<00:01:36.430> I'll<00:01:37.430> get<00:01:37.700> some<00:01:37.820> help<00:01:37.970> on<00:01:38.149> that<00:01:40.119> see<00:01:41.170> pipe

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
well I'll get some help on that see pipe

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.870 
well I'll get some help on that see pipe
has<00:01:42.590> been<00:01:42.800> drilled<00:01:43.100> out<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:44.570> sounds<00:01:45.200> awesome

bolt<00:02:43.610> obviously<00:02:44.090> won't<00:02:44.209> fit<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:45.170> so

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
bolt obviously won't fit in there so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.380 
bolt obviously won't fit in there so
what<00:02:47.030> we've<00:02:47.180> done<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:49.030> well<00:02:50.030> there's<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.270> little

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
what we've done is well there's a little

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.000 
what we've done is well there's a little
bit<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.629> tape<00:02:50.959> I'm<00:02:51.470> going<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:51.830> this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
bit of tape I'm going to like this

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.140 
bit of tape I'm going to like this
couple<00:02:52.280> pieces<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.489> which<00:02:52.640> will<00:02:52.790> take<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.060> keep

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
couple pieces of which will take to keep

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.400 
couple pieces of which will take to keep
it<00:02:53.270> from<00:02:53.360> falling<00:02:53.599> off<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.170> way<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.830> then

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
it from falling off this way and then

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it from falling off this way and then
there's<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:58.720> flexi<00:02:59.720> thing<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.830> then

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
there's this flexi thing that is then

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.360 
there's this flexi thing that is then
with<00:03:01.940> some<00:03:02.269> twisty<00:03:02.750> ties<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.069> it's

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
with some twisty ties so it's it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.970 
with some twisty ties so it's it's
looped<00:03:04.640> through<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.540> then<00:03:06.230> loop<00:03:06.680> through

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
looped through and then loop through

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.470 
looped through and then loop through
this<00:03:07.220> thing<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.640> then<00:03:07.790> twisty<00:03:08.090> tight<00:03:08.330> in

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
this thing and then twisty tight in

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.290 
this thing and then twisty tight in
place<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:10.280> actually<00:03:10.610> off<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.060> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
place and this is actually off of a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.980 
place and this is actually off of a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
so I was just going to take a master

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.760 
so I was just going to take a master
link<00:04:06.660> off<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.080> forget<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.500> I'll<00:04:07.590> deal<00:04:07.740> with

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
link off and forget it I'll deal with

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.790 
link off and forget it I'll deal with
that<00:04:07.890> later<00:04:08.040> right<00:04:09.320> well<00:04:12.140> spent<00:04:13.140> an<00:04:13.380> hour

that later right well spent an hour

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.460 
that later right well spent an hour
pulling<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:14.940> trying<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.840> get<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.020> I<00:04:16.290> got

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
pulling on this trying to get the I got

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.900 
pulling on this trying to get the I got
the<00:04:16.560> clip<00:04:16.770> off<00:04:16.920> no<00:04:17.130> problem<00:04:17.310> there's<00:04:17.670> an<00:04:17.760> easy

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the clip off no problem there's an easy

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.039 
the clip off no problem there's an easy
trick<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.390> use<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> pair<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.780> needlenose

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
trick you use a pair of needlenose

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.650 
trick you use a pair of needlenose
pliers<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.730> basically<00:04:20.910> brace<00:04:21.420> one

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
pliers and and you basically brace one

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930 
pliers and and you basically brace one
under<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.870> pliers<00:04:22.170> like<00:04:22.490> try<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.520> pick<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.730> spot

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
under the pliers like try to pick a spot

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.100 
under the pliers like try to pick a spot
that's<00:04:24.060> like<00:04:24.300> pretend<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.900> math

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
that's like pretend this is the math

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.290 
that's like pretend this is the math
line<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.470> clip<00:04:25.650> on<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.430> brace<00:04:26.700> one<00:04:27.120> end

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
line with a clip on it you brace one end

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.060 
line with a clip on it you brace one end
here<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> other<00:04:28.140> end<00:04:28.320> on<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> end<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.920> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
here and the other end on the end of the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.650 
here and the other end on the end of the
clip<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.910> push<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.870> pops<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.470> right<00:04:31.680> off

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
clip and push and it pops it right off

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.750 
clip and push and it pops it right off
anyway<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:36.920> yeah<00:04:37.920> but<00:04:38.130> then<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.340> couldn't<00:04:38.580> get

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
anyway it yeah but then I couldn't get

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.030 
anyway it yeah but then I couldn't get
the<00:04:38.820> actual<00:04:39.000> master<00:04:39.420> link<00:04:39.660> apart<00:04:40.230> I'll<00:04:40.650> find

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
the actual master link apart I'll find

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.590

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
can't get it to come off and I'm afraid

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.150 
can't get it to come off and I'm afraid
that<00:05:06.720> even<00:05:06.750> just<00:05:06.990> pressing<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.770> back<00:05:07.950> together

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
that even just pressing it back together

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.730 
that even just pressing it back together
and<00:05:08.840> reinstalling<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.020> clip<00:05:10.290> or<00:05:10.440> putting<00:05:10.620> a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
and reinstalling the clip or putting a

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.400 
and reinstalling the clip or putting a
new<00:05:10.860> clip<00:05:11.100> on<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.910> really<00:05:12.360> should<00:05:12.600> I'm

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
new clip on as you really should I'm

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.830 
new clip on as you really should I'm
afraid<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.950> still<00:05:13.980> wouldn't<00:05:14.430> work<00:05:14.640> well

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
afraid it still wouldn't work well

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.110 
afraid it still wouldn't work well
I<00:05:16.870> can't<00:05:17.710> seek<00:05:17.949> nothing<00:05:18.130> like<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:18.760> on<00:05:18.940> here

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
I can't seek nothing like it's on here

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.840 
I can't seek nothing like it's on here
somewhere<00:05:19.480> without<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.930> clip<00:05:20.139> on<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.850> around

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
somewhere without the clip on it around

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.469 
somewhere without the clip on it around
here<00:05:22.770> somewhere<00:05:23.770> anyway<00:05:24.730> it's<00:05:25.180> also<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.419> only

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
here somewhere anyway it's also the only

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.570 
here somewhere anyway it's also the only
cleanest<00:05:25.900> one<00:05:26.050> because<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.290> was<00:05:26.550> wd-40<00:05:27.550> and

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
cleanest one because I was wd-40 and

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.100 
cleanest one because I was wd-40 and
everything<00:05:28.090> trying<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.330> get<00:05:28.449> it<00:05:28.510> loose<00:05:28.660> now<00:05:29.050> it

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
everything trying to get it loose now it

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.150 
everything trying to get it loose now it
wasn't<00:05:29.290> happening<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:31.650> my<00:05:32.650> chain<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:32.979> really

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
wasn't happening so my chain is really

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.439 
wasn't happening so my chain is really
dirty<00:05:33.250> right<00:05:33.460> now<00:05:33.490> because<00:05:33.790> we<00:05:33.970> just<00:05:34.180> had<00:05:34.419> a

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
dirty right now because we just had a

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.240 
dirty right now because we just had a
rain<00:05:34.720> normally<00:05:35.560> it's<00:05:35.680> much<00:05:35.889> cleaner<00:05:36.130> than

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
rain normally it's much cleaner than

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.430 
rain normally it's much cleaner than
this<00:05:36.490> but<00:05:36.910> you<00:05:37.150> can<00:05:37.300> see<00:05:37.449> the<00:05:37.540> whole<00:05:37.660> bag<00:05:37.900> cuz<00:05:38.169> i

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
this but you can see the whole bag cuz i

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.879 
this but you can see the whole bag cuz i
was<00:05:39.160> riding<00:05:39.310> in<00:05:39.490> rain<00:05:39.610> for<00:05:39.940> several<00:05:40.240> days

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889

essentially<00:05:44.580> wash<00:05:45.580> me<00:05:46.770> um<00:05:49.229> but<00:05:50.229> yeah<00:05:50.560> I'm

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
essentially wash me um but yeah I'm

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.890 
essentially wash me um but yeah I'm
nervous<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:51.790> I've<00:05:52.000> compromised<00:05:52.540> the<00:05:52.720> safety

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
nervous that I've compromised the safety

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.840 
nervous that I've compromised the safety
of<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.320> chain<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.800> because<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:54.400> don't<00:05:54.639> have<00:05:54.700> a

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
of the chain and because I don't have a

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.490 
of the chain and because I don't have a
case<00:05:55.120> saver<00:05:55.419> not<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:55.930> they<00:05:56.050> do<00:05:56.110> anything

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
case saver not that they do anything

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.540 
case saver not that they do anything
anyway<00:05:56.770> but<00:05:56.950> when<00:05:57.070> I<00:05:57.100> put<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.370> bigger

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
anyway but when I put the bigger

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.610 
anyway but when I put the bigger
sprocket<00:05:57.970> on<00:05:58.060> for<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.750> track<00:05:58.960> day<00:05:59.080> one<00:05:59.260> day<00:05:59.410> we

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
sprocket on for a track day one day we

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.870 
sprocket on for a track day one day we
had<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.800> take<00:05:59.919> the<00:05:59.950> case<00:06:00.190> saver<00:06:00.400> off<00:06:00.669> because

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
had to take the case saver off because

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.060 
had to take the case saver off because
it<00:06:00.910> got<00:06:01.240> all<00:06:01.419> bent<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:01.930> warped<00:06:02.229> because<00:06:02.889> the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
it got all bent and warped because the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.159 
it got all bent and warped because the
sprocket<00:06:03.460> was<00:06:03.550> too<00:06:03.669> big<00:06:03.880> it's<00:06:04.840> back<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.050> a

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
sprocket was too big it's back to a

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.900 
sprocket was too big it's back to a
stock's<00:06:05.410> rocket<00:06:05.740> now<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.040> I<00:06:06.070> could<00:06:06.250> put<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.639> new
