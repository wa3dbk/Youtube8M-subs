00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
these are three packages from brick link

these are three packages from brick link
and<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.790> first<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.270> from<00:00:32.220> plastic<00:00:33.220> bricks

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
and the first is from plastic bricks

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.540 
and the first is from plastic bricks
direct<00:00:34.090> which<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.809> this<00:00:34.960> one<00:00:35.170> then<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.370> other

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
direct which is this one then the other

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.799

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
two are from the castle's squared and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.310 
two are from the castle's squared and
also<00:00:40.890> uncle<00:00:41.890> Steve's<00:00:42.400> bricks<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.960> let's<00:00:44.140> start

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
also uncle Steve's bricks so let's start

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.299 
also uncle Steve's bricks so let's start
with<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.500> first<00:00:44.650> one<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.650> this<00:00:47.650> is<00:00:47.710> obviously

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
with the first one and this is obviously

00:00:48.309 --> 00:01:03.630 
with the first one and this is obviously
the<00:00:48.640> smallest<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.449> three<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:03.460> you

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the smallest of the three and there you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.490 
the smallest of the three and there you
can<00:01:03.790> see<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.540> is<00:01:04.720> everything<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.290> we<00:01:05.380> have

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500

there<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.920> plastic<00:01:09.700> bricks<00:01:10.180> direct<00:01:13.470> all

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
there from plastic bricks direct all

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:31.380

close<00:01:38.330> up<00:01:38.510> at<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.930> end<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.760> then<00:01:40.760> finally<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
close up at the end and then finally the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:51.420 
close up at the end and then finally the
big<00:01:41.810> one

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.790 

this<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.580> really<00:01:52.820> good<00:01:53.030> packing<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:57.170> ever<00:01:57.410> open

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
this is really good packing to ever open

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.980 
this is really good packing to ever open
inside<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.670> one<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.940> these<00:01:59.030> so<00:02:01.660> see<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:02.780> is

inside of one of these so see this is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.500 
inside of one of these so see this is
probably<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.800> biggest<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.760> think<00:02:05.270> this

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510
