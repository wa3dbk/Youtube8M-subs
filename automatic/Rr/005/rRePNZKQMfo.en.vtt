that you've managed on your own don't
underestimate<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:20.290> for<00:01:21.070> me<00:01:21.220> two<00:01:21.490> important

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
underestimate it for me two important

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.389 
underestimate it for me two important
things<00:01:21.939> one<00:01:22.719> understand<00:01:23.560> what<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:23.950> and

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
things one understand what it is and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.760 
things one understand what it is and
learn<00:01:24.850> how<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.180> first<00:01:25.689> of<00:01:25.930> all<00:01:26.020> communicate

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
learn how to first of all communicate

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.550 
learn how to first of all communicate
the<00:01:26.950> value<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.399> your<00:01:27.520> PhD<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.270> yourself<00:01:28.840> most

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
the value of your PhD to yourself most

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.859 
the value of your PhD to yourself most
importantly<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.369> then<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.270> will<00:01:31.420> be<00:01:31.540> able<00:01:31.689> to

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
importantly and then you will be able to

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.260 
importantly and then you will be able to
communicate<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.590> others<00:01:32.680> but<00:01:33.460> most<00:01:33.700> PhD

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
communicate it to others but most PhD

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.060 
communicate it to others but most PhD
students<00:01:34.630> where<00:01:34.780> they<00:01:34.930> get<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.259> wrong<00:01:35.469> is<00:01:35.710> they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
students where they get it wrong is they

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.770 
students where they get it wrong is they
cannot<00:01:36.399> communicate<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.240> value<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.630> what

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
cannot communicate the value of what

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.480 
cannot communicate the value of what
they're<00:01:37.960> doing<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.320> themselves<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.310> think

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
they're doing to themselves and I think

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.340 
they're doing to themselves and I think
that's<00:01:39.670> where<00:01:39.909> all<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.180> wrong<00:01:40.390> starts<00:01:40.869> so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
that's where all the wrong starts so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.889 
that's where all the wrong starts so
when<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.680> why<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.090> why<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.329> don't<00:01:43.479> know<00:01:43.689> and

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
when is why you why we don't know and

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.859 
when is why you why we don't know and
and<00:01:44.640> exactly<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.850> then<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.180> will<00:01:46.390> be<00:01:46.509> able<00:01:46.689> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
and exactly and then you will be able to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.590 
and exactly and then you will be able to
say<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.439> others<00:01:47.680> as<00:01:47.799> well<00:01:48.390> thank<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
say this to others as well thank you
