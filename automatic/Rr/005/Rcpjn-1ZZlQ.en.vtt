00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
coverage for this bikini top you would

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.040 
coverage for this bikini top you would
just<00:01:02.170> adjust<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.309> pattern<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.089> side<00:01:04.360> but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
just adjust the pattern on the side but

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.600 
just adjust the pattern on the side but
once<00:01:05.260> you<00:01:05.379> print<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.650> out<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.100> just<00:01:06.310> need<00:01:06.490> to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
once you print it out you just need to

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.240 
once you print it out you just need to
add<00:01:06.729> seam<00:01:07.090> allowance<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.560> have<00:01:08.920> more

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
add seam allowance and to have more

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.300 
add seam allowance and to have more
coverage<00:01:09.790> like<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:11.020> model<00:01:11.619> in<00:01:11.800> this<00:01:12.009> photo

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.660 
here you just just make a few minor
adjustments<00:01:17.259> at<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.590> top<00:01:17.800> in<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> side<00:01:18.460> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.240 
adjustments at the top in the side of
the<00:01:18.820> pattern<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.740> I'm<00:01:20.800> just<00:01:20.950> going<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> lay

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
the pattern so I'm just going to lay

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090 
the pattern so I'm just going to lay
that<00:01:21.280> pattern<00:01:21.850> on<00:01:22.030> my<00:01:22.300> fabric<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.170> cut<00:01:23.979> out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
that pattern on my fabric and cut out

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.219 
that pattern on my fabric and cut out
two<00:01:24.130> pieces<00:01:24.399> one<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.630> left<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.080> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
two pieces one for the left and the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:34.290 
two pieces one for the left and the
right<00:01:26.530> side<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:33.610> going<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.970> cut<00:01:34.149> out<00:01:34.270> two

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
right side and I'm going to cut out two

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.080 
right side and I'm going to cut out two
additional<00:01:35.170> pieces<00:01:35.440> without<00:01:36.160> seam<00:01:36.550> allowance

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
additional pieces without seam allowance

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.779 
additional pieces without seam allowance
so<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.750> there's<00:01:38.380> gonna<00:01:38.530> be<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.860> lining<00:01:39.310> and

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
so the there's gonna be the lining and

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.480 
so the there's gonna be the lining and
it's<00:01:39.970> going<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.210> be<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.860> half-inch<00:01:41.860> shorter

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's going to be in half-inch shorter

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.639 
it's going to be in half-inch shorter
around<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> edges<00:01:43.810> because<00:01:44.289> I'm<00:01:44.410> going<00:01:44.590> to

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
around the edges because I'm going to

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.889 
around the edges because I'm going to
take<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.039> edge<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.490> fold<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.970> over<00:01:46.119> that

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
take the edge and fold it over that

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.950 
take the edge and fold it over that

lining and pin it down and sew along the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.810 
lining and pin it down and sew along the
edge<00:01:50.229> with<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> zig<00:01:51.520> zag<00:01:51.759> stitch<00:01:53.520> once<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.670> have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
edge with a zig zag stitch once you have

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.080 
edge with a zig zag stitch once you have
sewed<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.810> should<00:01:56.170> look<00:01:56.439> just<00:01:56.470> like<00:01:56.950> this
