practice session here's an example of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
practice session here's an example of
warming<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.330> arpeggios

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
warming down I like to do arpeggios

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.830

downward

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.810 

Oh

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.130 

Oh

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020 

just<00:01:41.140> like<00:01:41.350> an<00:01:41.500> athlete<00:01:41.710> after<00:01:42.160> they<00:01:42.580> exert

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
just like an athlete after they exert

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.840 
just like an athlete after they exert
themselves<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:44.530> need<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.950> stretch<00:01:45.430> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
themselves they need to stretch and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.540 
themselves they need to stretch and
maybe<00:01:46.300> take<00:01:46.600> some<00:01:46.840> time<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.350> relax<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:48.370> need

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
maybe take some time to relax you need

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.370 
maybe take some time to relax you need
to<00:01:48.610> do<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:48.970> as<00:01:49.090> well<00:01:49.330> because<00:01:49.780> these<00:01:50.050> facial

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
to do that as well because these facial

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.130 
to do that as well because these facial
muscles<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.190> your<00:01:51.640> arm<00:01:51.910> batur<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.930> been

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
muscles and your arm batur have been

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.650 
muscles and your arm batur have been
taxed<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:54.010> they<00:01:54.640> need<00:01:54.880> some<00:01:55.150> time<00:01:55.390> to

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
taxed and they need some time to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.780 
taxed and they need some time to
rejuvenate<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.770> warming<00:01:57.250> down<00:01:57.400> process

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
rejuvenate so that warming down process

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.630 
rejuvenate so that warming down process
gives<00:01:58.720> them<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> chance<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.650> relax<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.340> stretch

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
gives them a chance to relax and stretch

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.180 
gives them a chance to relax and stretch
maybe<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.840> next<00:02:02.080> day<00:02:02.290> since<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.980> were<00:02:03.010> only

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
maybe the next day since you were only

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.580 
maybe the next day since you were only
able<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.520> go<00:02:03.730> 15<00:02:04.210> minutes<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.870> extend<00:02:05.410> that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
able to go 15 minutes you extend that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.460 
able to go 15 minutes you extend that
time<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.220> go<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.910> 20<00:02:07.210> minutes<00:02:07.510> but<00:02:08.260> I<00:02:08.290> would

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
time and go for 20 minutes but I would

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.320 
time and go for 20 minutes but I would
recommend<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:09.070> warming<00:02:09.460> down<00:02:09.640> because<00:02:10.149> then

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
recommend the warming down because then

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.390 
recommend the warming down because then
you'll<00:02:10.479> come<00:02:10.810> back<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.710> face<00:02:12.010> will<00:02:12.220> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you'll come back and your face will be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.260 
you'll come back and your face will be
fresher<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.270> next<00:02:13.600> time<00:02:14.730> once<00:02:15.730> again<00:02:15.910> my
