00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 weight at all and we sent a batch of liners 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.260
 Ilya Midjli Chonko is better for the contest 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.219
 known party alliance kai party and so 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.219
 Mikhail Chigorin 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 the famous Russian chess player and classic 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.650
 this party is also a classic 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.619
 although on the basis of some party cheek lily 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 against lawrence 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 also in the same year but we will assume that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.210
 This party was played as if from a sheet 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.090
 Mikhail Chigorin was at first more such 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.010
 attacking plan chess player then he 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 come and find out this brutal protection 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 chigorin in the spanish party came on 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 more traditional rails 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 but at the dawn of their careers dolbat such 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 same revenge so Italian party white 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.129
 above the trunk on g5 black immediately his 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 rejected 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 it's a classic let's say so classic 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.689
 Italian party when how else 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.909
 novice chess players are told about 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.159
 tom that's right here let's take a little bit 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.170
 the grids will come back here here 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 before black castling 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.619
 better not to take five already because otherwise 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 then rushi will follow followed by already 5 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.439
 or concrete on f6 but all lie in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.869
 Ternopol to the morgue is not scary but you can 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 unpleasant, but here 5 is the same elephant 3 or 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.729
 castling whites and might hit our 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 5 ganny but when castling is not done 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.159
 have to enter and h5 h5 is a sacrifice 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.429
 the victim of the series 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.999
 i you know 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.380
 with the unobvious victim queen i 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:54.700
 maybe sacrifice sometime in life 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.740
 the queen but here so never let 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 look at this exchange 5 h4 horse 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:10.690
 j7 and yoji coyne jd 8 thousand donated for 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:18.700
 an elephant but it's not an elephant 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:21.099
 elephant g4 then move and after health until 2 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.200
 the d4 horse is essentially not even black 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.519
 they play the horse they simply have no time 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.220
 on this they go ahead and what happens 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.980
 we have two elephants in attack which is necessary 4 here 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:40.480
 so is the pawn on the harvest of Latakia our 8 rook 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 That's how I like the machine says that 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:50.859
 here after h3 only followed 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.799
 horses would hardly Shah now we have to drink because 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.500
 that the king h1 will own as many as three cups 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.590
 elephant and in 3 with a mat you see 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.549
 so drink water drink and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 either beat here either the horse e6 further 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.720
 blacks scrapping big cavalry and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.919
 have eaten 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 ate eaten and generally black and white 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.709
 waiting for a hard ending but apparently she 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.799
 prolonged but at least it was possible 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.230
 fight all the same on foot f2 black yet 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.239
 you need to keep it and maybe she 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.010
 overeat two pawns here on the edge of a common 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.959
 although it was possible to develop mainly by driving 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.000
 thought it might even be better 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.739
 In general, a difficult position and a rival 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.049
 plays horse c3 all ends 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:48.669
 instantly but he was such a chess player he 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.400
 not weak I'll say 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.829
 your life 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.170
 he is there simultaneous play no this 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.769
 was really a chess player 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 but here he is clearly just confused and 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.750
 the party ends chapter finally 3 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.159
 sin elephant byd f3 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.470
 all because there is no protection from our mat 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.829
 own one mat threatens the same of smart 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.639
 it is no longer possible to simply drink 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.430
 a bunch 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.610
 Well, you can go for Tomash 42 pro became 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.550
 debit h4 actually 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.510
 a step can still do but it does not change 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 Essentially what is a classic Italian 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.789
 party 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.720
 Mikhail Chigorin Russian famous 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.380
 chess player 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.380
