00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
I refuse to get rid of that because I

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.910 
I refuse to get rid of that because I
know<00:03:24.720> they<00:03:24.930> don't<00:03:25.019> make<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.350> anymore<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.830> I'm

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
know they don't make it anymore so I'm

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.680

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
keeping that in there I've lured crack

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.080 
keeping that in there I've lured crack
and<00:03:27.930> basically<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.650> from<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> creators
