he did all this testing and posted it on

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
he did all this testing and posted it on
the<00:00:54.600> forums<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> he<00:00:56.010> shows<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:57.090> experience

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the forums and he shows what experience

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
the forums and he shows what experience
per<00:00:57.660> hour<00:00:57.780> he<00:00:58.020> got<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> experience<00:00:58.590> /<00:00:58.890> kill

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
per hour he got the experience / kill

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
per hour he got the experience / kill
experience<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.820> kills<00:01:00.149> per<00:01:00.359> minute<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> each

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
experience or kills per minute and each

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
experience or kills per minute and each
of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> areas<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.640> kills<00:01:03.239> per<00:01:03.449> minute<00:01:03.719> and

of the areas now kills per minute and

hills of slaughter is really up to par
with<00:03:15.409> these<00:03:15.530> other<00:03:15.680> three<00:03:15.950> areas<00:03:16.370> he<00:03:17.030> did

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
with these other three areas he did

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.849 
with these other three areas he did
point<00:03:17.359> out<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.629> Aria<00:03:17.989> crater<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.739> no

point out that Aria crater to is no

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.409 
point out that Aria crater to is no
longer<00:03:19.129> worth<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.609> because<00:03:19.790> they<00:03:20.030> nerfed<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
longer worth it because they nerfed the

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.210 
longer worth it because they nerfed the
experience<00:03:20.810> from<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.989> scorpions<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:22.160> uh

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
experience from the scorpions but uh

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.729 
experience from the scorpions but uh
these<00:03:22.940> three<00:03:23.299> definitely<00:03:23.780> solid<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.560> then<00:03:24.709> I

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
these three definitely solid and then I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.439 
these three definitely solid and then I
think<00:03:25.040> feels<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.310> slaughter<00:03:25.549> he's<00:03:26.209> probably

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
think feels a slaughter he's probably

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.740 
think feels a slaughter he's probably
right<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.079> would<00:03:27.169> be<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.410> next<00:03:27.739> highest

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
right is it would be the next highest

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.650 
right is it would be the next highest
experience<00:03:29.750> per<00:03:30.109> hour<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:31.220> lineup<00:03:31.660> but

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
experience per hour in that lineup but

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.300 
experience per hour in that lineup but
yeah<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.079> thought<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.319> was<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> good<00:03:33.709> post

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
yeah I thought that was a good post

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.559
