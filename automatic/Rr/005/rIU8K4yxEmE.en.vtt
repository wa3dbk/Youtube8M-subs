00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.189
 Hi 500 students 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.890
 see the text for the next issue for 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.400
 find out which of the robbers 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.550
 hawk hawk got the money 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.269
 stolen from a bank branch 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.460
 the delegate noted the following facts 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.600
 the fact that in hawk hawk left the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 City 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 so the money did not stay with the hawk 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.170
 fact 2 if there was an ATM in 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:10.299
 front of the bank then the money was 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:16.600
 with hawk f3 hawk hawk left the 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:19.510
 f4 city had an ATM 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.750
 in front of the bank where the money was 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.310
 delivered to the hawk woman 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.409
 considering that the propositions f1 f2 f3 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:37.649
 f4 be true of the items 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.649
 following the rules of the sun 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.929
 Let's go the next question. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.080
 question 24 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.750
 The proposition was given to the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.500
 hawk woman is true 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:05.410
 right or wrong solution and we will analyze 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.190
 the argument if the argument formed with 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.630
 this conclusion was the valid argument 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.620
 means that this proposition will be 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.730
 true 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.709
 Let us then analyze the argument we have 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.770
 premise premise premise is wire 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:28.420
 Grave and hawk get out of town carry on 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.390
 hawk left the city then the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.550
 money did not stay with the plane 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.970
 if there was an ATM in front 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.970
 to the bank 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.770
 then the money was with the hawk gav 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:50.640
 hawk left the city there was a box 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:55.390
 and vis-Ã -vis the bank or 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.570
 or the money was given to the woman of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.760
 hawk the issue said that these 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.560
 propositions were true, that is to say 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.800
 this is true 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.150
 this proposition is also true 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.690
 this is also true and this is also the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.690
 truth 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.799
 we have the real premises 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.549
 now the argument will be valid if the 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.040
 conclusion is necessarily true 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.049
 we will then analyze the premises as 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.060
 all are true the first one 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.130
 conditional is true 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.590
 the second is a conditional is also 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.870
 true and the third is not a 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.250
 Conditional is a proposition and that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.480
 so hawk and hawk came out of the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.739
 city is a true proposition this 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.269
 it is true 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.310
 we have this it is true we have 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.510
 then the starting point will leave 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.959
 from here missing hawk 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.340
 out of the city this is true since 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.459
 this is true 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.159
 in the first premise of airplane and hawk 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.989
 He left town and I know this is true. 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:16.639
 soon as the first proposition is a 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.579
 conditional proposition opens since the 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.410
 conditional if truth then some 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.930
 thing of truth 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.240
 I was consequent so that the conditional 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.600
 It's true, it has to be 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.850
 necessarily true then the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.260
 money did not stay with hawk as well 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.570
 it will be a true proposition soon 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.610
 money did not stay with the plane is a 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.990
 true proposition 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.350
 therefore on the second premise money 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.729
 stayed with a hawk if to a proposition 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.810
 false 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.310
 the spin is left with hawk will be false already 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.449
 That money stayed with Brazil is 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.510
 false 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.880
 as the second premise takes a 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.870
 conditional and conventional said 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.840
 if so, then this false truth 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.949
 antecedent so that the conditional is 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.930
 true 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:18.050
 by the truth table can only be false 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.830
 soon there was an ATM on the counter 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.320
 the bank will necessarily be false 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.650
 When we got down here, there was a 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.820
 ATM in the bank will record 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.970
 a necessarily false proposition 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.970
 now just read the last 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.380
 the last one the money was delivered 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:46.760
 to the hawk woman as statesmen are 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.590
 or the truth I have if false and then 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.130
 study truth 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.990
 now a conditional to see the aad 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.840
 junction to be true 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.560
 as this first one is false that second 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.960
 It will have to be true. 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.169
 only if it is false then true 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.130
 truth only if false then truth 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.860
 in fact 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.620
 therefore we have that money 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.000
 handed to the hawk woman will be a 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.860
 proposition necessarily true you 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.900
 so that the document is valid when 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.639
 the provinces are true 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.120
 the conclusion will necessarily be 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.939
 true then what conclusion 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.250
 I could possibly take out could 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.949
 take the one I want the money was 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.849
 delivered to the hawk woman is true 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:56.569
 I can soon conclude that the money 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:59.379
 money was in treg the woman of 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.379
 Hawk 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.569
 this conclusion is necessarily 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.310
 true it is necessarily 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:12.169
 true then I can conclude 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.569
 quietly as I tested an argument 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.699
 that the money was delivered to the 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.810
 hawk woman is a proposition 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:21.169
 true 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.779
 he said that the proposition money 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.889
 was delivered to the hawk woman is 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:26.990
 true 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:33.379
 he is right because it is an argument 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:39.009
 valid that there are 24 the answer is right 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:46.430
 allez posta is alright certain right alright 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:51.319
 answer close this question number 24 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:54.250
 good luck and a good answer. 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.250
 next question
