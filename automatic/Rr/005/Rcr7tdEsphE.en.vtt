back<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.960> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
back on there it is that that is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.010 
back on there it is that that is
essentially<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> unit<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> terms<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
essentially the unit now in terms of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.889 
essentially the unit now in terms of
setting<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.460> simple<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
setting it up it's really simple all you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.709 
setting it up it's really simple all you
have<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.950> plug<00:01:59.340> this<00:02:00.030> component<00:02:00.630> now

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
have to do is plug this component now

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.149 
have to do is plug this component now
this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> four<00:02:01.320> pole<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.890> sure<00:02:02.040> how

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this is a four pole and not sure how

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.280 
this is a four pole and not sure how
clear<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> video<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.020> four

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
clear that is in the video it's a four

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.770 
clear that is in the video it's a four
pole<00:02:04.530> adapter<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> essential

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
pole adapter there which is essential

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.190 
pole adapter there which is essential
that<00:02:06.960> plug<00:02:07.799> straight<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.429> controller

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that plug straight into your controller

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
that plug straight into your controller
just<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.000> here

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
just like that now as you can see here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
just like that now as you can see here
you've<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you've got to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
you've got to
little<00:02:14.040> inputs<00:02:14.720> one<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.870> those<00:02:16.110> will<00:02:16.650> go

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
little inputs one of those will go

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.460 
little inputs one of those will go
directly<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.549> your<00:02:17.670> headset<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:19.140> believe

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
directly to your headset now I believe

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.220 
directly to your headset now I believe
it<00:02:19.620> doesn't<00:02:19.920> really<00:02:20.040> matter<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.519> one<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
it doesn't really matter which one so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.899 
it doesn't really matter which one so
now<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.769> see<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:23.129> have<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> continuous

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
now you can see we have a continuous

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.149 
now you can see we have a continuous
loop<00:02:24.150> from<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.049> controller<00:02:25.470> through<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
loop from the controller through to the

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.300 
loop from the controller through to the
headset<00:02:26.610> now<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.569> other<00:02:27.810> side<00:02:28.049> what<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.010> want

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
headset now the other side what we want

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
headset now the other side what we want
to<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.819> capture<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.329> audio<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:30.930> run<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.409> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
to do to capture the audio is run it to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.990 
to do to capture the audio is run it to
your<00:02:31.680> capture<00:02:31.920> device<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.609> I've<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
your capture device so I've got the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.960 
your capture device so I've got the
elgato<00:02:33.629> HD<00:02:34.349> 60<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> use<00:02:35.939> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
elgato HD 60 so I'm going to use that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.440 
elgato HD 60 so I'm going to use that
and<00:02:36.480> all<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.319> want<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.709> here<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.700> plug<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and all we want to do here is plug a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.170 
and all we want to do here is plug a
standard<00:02:40.260> RCA<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.459> RCA<00:02:41.819> but

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
standard RCA I think it's an RCA but

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.960 
standard RCA I think it's an RCA but
basically<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.720> three<00:02:43.049> pole<00:02:43.290> connector<00:02:43.609> in<00:02:44.609> from

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
basically a three pole connector in from

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.160 
basically a three pole connector in from
there<00:02:46.040> straight<00:02:47.040> into<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.790> audio<00:02:48.269> input<00:02:48.959> in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there straight into the audio input in

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.009 
there straight into the audio input in
your<00:02:49.560> el<00:02:49.739> gato<00:02:50.000> now<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> will<00:02:51.599> do<00:02:51.810> is

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
your el gato now what that will do is

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.259 
your el gato now what that will do is
it'll<00:02:52.290> pick<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.980> game<00:02:53.370> chat<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.060> as

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
it'll pick up in game chat it's as

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.110 
it'll pick up in game chat it's as
simple<00:02:54.299> as<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.900> guys<00:02:55.549> now<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> next

is have you guys actually used the the
astro<00:03:16.230> powered<00:03:16.709> splitter<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> working<00:03:17.639> for

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
astro powered splitter is it working for

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.759 
astro powered splitter is it working for
you<00:03:18.030> or<00:03:18.329> what<00:03:18.569> other<00:03:18.780> methods<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.620> guys

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you or what other methods do you guys

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.039 
you or what other methods do you guys
actually<00:03:20.040> use<00:03:20.609> now<00:03:21.419> I'm<00:03:21.540> not<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> hundred

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
actually use now I'm not a hundred

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.680 
actually use now I'm not a hundred
percent<00:03:22.199> sure<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.699> will<00:03:24.090> actually<00:03:24.389> work

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
percent sure if this will actually work

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.430 
percent sure if this will actually work
in<00:03:25.560> both<00:03:25.949> the<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.760> xbox<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.720> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
in both the the xbox one and the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.059 
in both the the xbox one and the
PlayStation<00:03:29.069> 4<00:03:29.340> controller<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.449> it<00:03:30.569> will

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
PlayStation 4 controller I think it will

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.920 
PlayStation 4 controller I think it will
because<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.250> does<00:03:32.459> look<00:03:32.699> like<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:33.060> fits<00:03:33.329> in<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
because it does look like it fits in the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.839 
because it does look like it fits in the
PlayStation<00:03:34.530> 4<00:03:34.769> controller<00:03:34.919> pretty<00:03:35.639> damn

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
PlayStation 4 controller pretty damn

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.879 
PlayStation 4 controller pretty damn
well<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.019> not<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.230> hundred<00:03:37.440> percent<00:03:37.560> sure

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
well but I'm not a hundred percent sure

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.369 
well but I'm not a hundred percent sure
