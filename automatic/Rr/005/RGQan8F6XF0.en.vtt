00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.469
 a sad sight wind and weather 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.349
 have irregular maintenance 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.539
 vigorously added to our garden domizil 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.099
 not only dirty and balanced 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.859
 make the exterior facade 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.529
 unsightly also knotholes and deep 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.490
 scratches carry their part in it 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.150
 hard to miss 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.800
 a renovation is urgently needed 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.079
 we start with the outside arrangements 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.820
 How to unscrew flowerpots so 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.469
 we free the exterior of 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.360
 and can also obstruct the 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.059
 flower tub later piece by piece 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.070
 clean and paint 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.079
 Now let 's rough the roof of foliage 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.879
 and dirt and rinse the bitumen 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.789
 Shingles with the help of the garden hose 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.710
 thoroughly after that we devote ourselves 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.989
 the same ergi and the roof 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.850
 edge do not afford the by mold 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.730
 and pest infest quickly unusable 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.679
 will also show up in our case 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.390
 When checking clear traces of 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.259
 weathering so continue away with it 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.540
 then we also remove the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.240
 ailing blow bar the door the without 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.250
 any resistance is yielding now 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.320
 to clean it out we have to say that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.810
 Facade vigorously with a hand brush 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.150
 around the surfaces of dust and dirt 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.290
 bird droppings to free 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.720
 especially cobwebs have to disappear 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.659
 as you paint for very ugly 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.100
 provide effects 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.110
 We will help you to repair shadows and knotholes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.689
 wooden kit and reduce so the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 attack points for pests but also 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.960
 unsightly dirt deposits are like that 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 no topic anymore 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 Now it's the facade directly to body 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.200
 we treat the surfaces with one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.180
 practical delta grinder 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.909
 while we pay attention to even 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.770
 sanding movements stubborn dirt and 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.670
 rest of the old glaze give now 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.619
 finally put your resistance on before we 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.540
 But now start with the new painting 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.870
 we still have the broken one 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.210
 replace parts 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.550
 we start with the new strike bar 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.370
 We first fix these provisionally 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
 with screwing in place 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.750
 everything is perfect in regular 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.270
 distances pre-drilled because this time will 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.550
 screwed important while we have 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.010
 enough distance to the door knew so that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.110
 The wood does not travel yet another 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.150
 screw in one after the other and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 finished the door works again 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 perfectly synonymous to the new the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170
 recipients we have not forgotten 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.960
 she becomes fast and in the same way 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.910
 uncomplicated screwed now follow the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.280
 Gable wall afford which we with the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.990
 place boards screw down before the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
 Screw also comes here before the back 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.250
 prevent drilling through the holes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.810
 we carry that wood in while carrying it 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.210
 screws rips and the bar 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.540
 be properly attracted to the board 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.860
 can 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.850
 that looks pretty good 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.990
 finally are the actual ones 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.900
 painting on it 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 we used an elastic one 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.110
 open-pored weather protection have the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.270
 durably against external influences such as 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 Moisture and UV radiation protects 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.220
 wear with a soft wide brush 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.320
 we do not paint the color thoroughly 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.440
 to vigorous wipes always 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.690
 along the wood grain on the joints 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.760
 We carefully exclude this with it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 no excessive color deposits 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.140
 emerge after drying we paint 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.580
 the garden house one more time so 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 is guaranteed that the color 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.280
 sufficiently covers and results on 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.560
 the end is also great the new 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.330
 components are no longer recognizable and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.940
 the garden shines in new splendor 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.940
 that's where the joy comes from
