00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
I am a big fan of a chem blog just so

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.050 
I am a big fan of a chem blog just so
you<00:01:55.750> know<00:01:55.980> anyway<00:01:56.980> I'm<00:01:57.130> just<00:01:57.190> gonna<00:01:57.400> exit<00:01:57.880> that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you know anyway I'm just gonna exit that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.320 
you know anyway I'm just gonna exit that
so<00:01:58.360> I'll<00:01:58.540> cut<00:01:58.720> out<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.930> video<00:02:00.030> doesn't<00:02:01.030> just

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
so I'll cut out the video doesn't just

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.450 
so I'll cut out the video doesn't just
have<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.720> video<00:02:02.020> as<00:02:02.260> well<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.280> can

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
have to be video as well you can

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.580 
have to be video as well you can
obviously<00:02:03.700> do<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.210> photos<00:02:04.720> too<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.440> we

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
obviously do it with photos too so if we

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.070 
obviously do it with photos too so if we
were<00:02:05.710> looking<00:02:06.460> through<00:02:06.670> pictures<00:02:07.030> or<00:02:07.660> music

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
were looking through pictures or music

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.130 
were looking through pictures or music
for<00:02:08.619> example<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:10.030> again<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.660> could<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.960> done

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
for example then again it could be done

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.870 
for example then again it could be done
the<00:02:11.260> same

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940
