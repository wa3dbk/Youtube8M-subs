00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 [Laughs] 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.810
 and try to raise the temperature of the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.229

 and why do not you go up the thermostat 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.320
 good question 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.399
 office is not in my office is not 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.170
 here next to the office of the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.210
 davenport teacher who currently 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.210
 suffers hot flashes associated with menopause 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.660
 because there is a hole in there that because there 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 a hole and my new office I've 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.110
 reduced the chances to two days and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.110
 good on the wall 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 worse yet there was something on the wall that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 I wanted to escape 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.870
 at least you have a window that 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.040
 Open is fine 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.410

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.050
 there is the pair does not match it does not go with 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.050

 you do not understand it, it's really a nightingale 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.459
 the nightingales can change their song 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.870

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.720
