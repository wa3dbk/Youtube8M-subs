00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.609
 several things that as they are as we continue in our tutorial we are going to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.030
 explain how 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.729
 percent export us animated objects with texture 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.700
 of blender harkin index from 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.700
 or go out to light 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.239
 let's hope now cross 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.499
 I have seen 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.329
 this as you know this default cube that comes 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.969
 and now to create texture is a bit different because the tools 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 which is using r the move where it is deposited differently than 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.890
 what it was to light 2 points 4 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.280
 and we're going to go to what is material 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 and we are going to choose this study 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.280
 and after knowing that there is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.370
 add the v 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's click here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 search I did not ask for more unpublished 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 we already have the split screen 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.040
 and to add we are going to choose it from 8 not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.930
 appetite 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 city ​​comments and it was like orange shading 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.220
 so much 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.880
 let's all pass because it says that on this side also be like a mesh 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.830
 and good eyes approved this study 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.500
 of arts 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 the title now you're worth 'in the Maya 15 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.890
 what we are going to banish the image 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.920
 oppenheim 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.860
 minute in which Egypt decided 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 victorious and I suppose 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 pokémon good is the example that I put texture 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.720
 x so much 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.880
 To make it look 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690
 on this side the cube we are going to put 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.200
 ate south 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.150
 missions 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.340
 to see it well mossad abc 12 detach 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 and yes they actually record 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.050
 already make the goal texture 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.780
 percent and good is different when exporting it already in the distinctive sadar the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.620
 accounts that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.570
 you can lose a bit the own era textures 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.860
 but it is good to work it to use it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.540
 work as the textures history of quartzite and place the images 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.830
 in the object not because it is a cube but they are going to be one more object 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.879
 developed more accurate more is difficult complicated 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 it would be good if they already work thin build here illán which will emit 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.859
 read again bush 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.209
 Passarella gave him a broad and more sensitive 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.629
 we are going to put to swim affirmed to be able to inherit managements in nations 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.769
 we press you 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.449
 and so set it to tone 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.469
 roth is that 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.029
 akiba 1 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.209
 I tell you here 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.879
 jose at scale 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.359
 kiko rotation 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.399
 ii - move them 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.789
 us here 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.389
 and we read it 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.559
 and again 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.049
 track 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.109
 realize I have an animation with him here 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.749
 it makes us another dimension 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.109
 Accede to 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 I snoop leo 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.779
 are here 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.179
 it's not a simple 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:14.939
 and address it 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.959
 for blind people export it in daegu 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.429
 if it's true in previous 100 in defeated 4 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.899
 they said he had gp save it as block mompó double 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.619
 here there is better thing to export it because it has a fault 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.889
 per cent what I know is that they are of this x that does not allow it to be exported very well 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.059
 3d files 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.980
 there you 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.980
 we have exported you run aground 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.979
 the eleventh marcum 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.539
 with the desk 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.409
 sign the pokémon 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.409
 montmeló 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.439
 we export 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.019
 and now it's 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.849
 go out 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.389
 ixmiquilpan 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.299
 He expressed that it does not take so long 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.369
 we load wearing 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:08.799
 this time we have less this one 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.630
 an advance already developed 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.349
 what are you going to see 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.560
 to add what we have done is sell 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.779
 we put to do 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.569
 misfortune 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.569
 we look for pokémon dae 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.490
 here until we support nda 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.449
 Pokemon Dae 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.969
 fran account 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 let's talk about rhythm 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.990
 Millán but as you do not see much beyond 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 try 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.409
 visualize the judges I also got it 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.409
 to zoom in on the camera 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.349
 let's give it 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.849
 10 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.849
 17 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.229
 they lied 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.389
 up to the cube 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.229
 Pokemon 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.719
 with his bow 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.719
 and in this area, textures 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 with the texture that assaults 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:18.969
 Caste texture included 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:19.919
 now 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.919
 we have that replica 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 you see in the image or nothing 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.650
 they realize 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.980
 that gave an animation but especially the network luc 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.059
 we do the impossible be bouquets 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.879
 already caste ccoo 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.999
 on the property we have used to 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.699
 for the pokémon that this one 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.130
 this is a PT 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.990
 let's go to pec 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.569
 until the effect itself 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.490
 sbx matters 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.139
 what we are going to do is 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.189
 be here in lima animation 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.510
 the ospa house by defoult 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.099
 I know 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.099
 marquez and repeat let's see here 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 but we are going to win 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.969
 here is your 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.559
 here it is 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.559
 coentrao 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.749
 and that principle 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.619
 and that's all and good 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:28.780
 percent if you want to do with subjects plus percent 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.229
 difficult cross more precise of the cem blender you 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.319
 i - it's all thanks i think we've given them and welcome lion
