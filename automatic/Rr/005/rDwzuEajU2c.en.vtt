00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
picture and I just check all my

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.800 
picture and I just check all my
verticals<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.549> also<00:01:05.810> check

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
verticals that way you can also check

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.179 
verticals that way you can also check
your<00:01:07.080> horizontals<00:01:08.040> too<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.920> as

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
your horizontals too but that's not as

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.580 
your horizontals too but that's not as
accurate<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.080> gravity

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
accurate because this is with gravity

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
accurate because this is with gravity
keeping<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> perfectly<00:01:15.119> plumb<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
keeping it perfectly plumb and when you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.490 
keeping it perfectly plumb and when you
hold<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.189> horizontal<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.400> can

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
hold it horizontal you can

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.539 
hold it horizontal you can
subconsciously<00:01:19.500> tilt<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> angles<00:01:20.250> there's<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
subconsciously tilt the angles there's a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.560 
subconsciously tilt the angles there's a
mirror<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.150> say<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.450> use

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.450 
these are rolls that got from an old
canvas<00:02:00.160> but<00:02:00.700> if<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:00.880> take<00:02:01.060> paper<00:02:01.270> towel<00:02:01.510> rolls

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
canvas but if you take paper towel rolls

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.400 
canvas but if you take paper towel rolls
that'll<00:02:03.460> do<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> trick<00:02:03.700> too<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.870> what<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.290> do

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
that'll do the trick too and what you do

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.590 
that'll do the trick too and what you do
is<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> hold<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.920> up<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.010> your<00:02:06.190> eyes<00:02:06.370> and<00:02:06.910> you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
is you hold it up to your eyes and you

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.320 
is you hold it up to your eyes and you
can<00:02:07.630> actually<00:02:07.990> look<00:02:08.380> at<00:02:08.670> two<00:02:09.670> objects<00:02:10.149> at<00:02:10.270> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
can actually look at two objects at the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.600 
can actually look at two objects at the
same<00:02:10.600> time<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.200> little<00:02:11.890> tricky<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.340> me<00:02:12.460> there

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
same time a little tricky for me there

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.930 
same time a little tricky for me there
you<00:02:12.700> go<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.430> somehow<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.850> don't

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
you go and that just somehow I don't

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.190 
you go and that just somehow I don't
know<00:02:16.060> why<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.540> tricks<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:16.900> brain<00:02:17.080> into

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
know why but it tricks your brain into

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
know why but it tricks your brain into
seeing<00:02:17.800> two<00:02:18.040> separate<00:02:18.400> things<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> same

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
seeing two separate things at the same

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.570 
seeing two separate things at the same
time<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.620> kind<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.920> split<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.430> up

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
time so you can kind of split it up

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.890 
time so you can kind of split it up
visually<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.390> you're<00:02:22.510> looking<00:02:22.690> at<00:02:22.750> one

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
Apple you look at the other Apple and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.210 
Apple you look at the other Apple and
you<00:02:26.110> start<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> notice<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.740> things<00:02:27.040> you
