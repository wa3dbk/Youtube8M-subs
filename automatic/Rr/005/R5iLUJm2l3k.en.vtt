00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello special muscle maker at this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 video is about the biggest mistakes when 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.610
 biceps training my biceps training 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.650
 you will often see that the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.210
 Rangehen people with heavy weights 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 completely free according to the motto all the more 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 weight all the more muscle build up so completely 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 that is not wrong but just play 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.050
 also other factors with purely for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 for example the training technique 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 shows the times a thing you unfortunately 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 relatively often has to see because it saves you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.140
 a dumbbell 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 Of course, that should be as big as possible 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 Although it still works then it is trained like that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 according to the motto that is just done 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.270
 have nothing other than swing 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.860
 brought 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 I got a swing from the hip 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.219
 even from deep out of the body swing 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 brought and the weight in the position 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 I do not have the weight to loll 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.879
 concentration of a weight lifted 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.050
 but just lashed 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.879
 Often there was also a reversal 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 swing used that is the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.580
 Conversion is just the swing 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.500
 that you develop out of here rather than first 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 times a symmetrical load in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 Station to go is the reverse momentum 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 finally used by the rhein immediately 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 to go to the house 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 that's just the back of the most 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.790
 made mistakes when biceps training it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 is working with momentum with 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 turnaround worked with any 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 lufthansa is working on the main thing 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.329
 the highest possible weight is in this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 position 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.640
 absolute error number one momentum 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.979
 let out 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 biceps training is isolated that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.880
 training for a very small muscles 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 this very small muscle needs to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.340
 focused approach when it says 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 no other muscle works except that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.759
 biceps very important that is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.380
 Weight is not the case right now 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.860
 important but just the execution of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.979
 all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.490
 Another thing is that my biceps 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.590
 training often 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.570
 the attitude of the upper arm is forgotten 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.270
 again and again you see that in the studio 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.640
 someone still has such a biceps training 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.070
 worse it looks if you can do that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.479
 the sz rod sees it is her 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.720
 of course a very light weight court 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.910
 but I'll recognize it if that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.519
 weight not from the body of the authority 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.060
 but more or less out of the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.700
 shoulder high forced 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.620
 who is working more neck or shoulder 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.400
 biceps because that 's the question 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.090
 that means the upper arm stays on the body 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.290
 and the weight of the body crossed away 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.299
 Only now do I notice in the biceps 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.760
 really 4 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.330
 the tension when I get away from the body 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 role 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.390
 that means again with the movement 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.160
 Pay attention to this 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.930
 the weight is not as close as possible to the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.209
 pull up body else works 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.120
 shoulder neck party but the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.080
 Let biceps work in isolation and just work 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.910
 the body away at 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.500
 There is a very good trick 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.209
 good exercise for the first time again 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.370
 to learn correctly because partly over 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.630
 months is badly trained over years 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.359
 please come with me I'll show you this 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:14.380
 just a little more so on accordingly 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:17.150
 on the ground so natural here 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.190
 accordingly, lie down with your back 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.900
 to earn on the ground clementi 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.640
 is on the floor and the top is 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.319
 on the floor 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.319
 now you can not fake it 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.190
 of course quite a bit of weight 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.120
 important in the exercise, I had to synonymous there 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.870
 focus 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.430
 Of course , you clear something of the elbow 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.900
 clean in the ground but you do not have it 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.470
 the possibility so backwards to 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.510
 fake 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.489
 as you often see when you with ÃŸ 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.750
 It also helps a lot of people to exercise 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.319
 already with a long trade too 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.510
 work out 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.220
 so without sz stood a straight trade 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.049
 because you 're just there from the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.810
 concentrate better away from the body 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.730
 comes as that with the sz rod like 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.920
 Simply tempted if you give it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.940
 the unclean trained somehow urban 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.190
 pull 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.780
 most importantly, the first thing you do 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.669
 should not notice the weight is 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.190
 decisive but the execution of the 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.830
 All of you are really careful that you 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.070
 not working with swing second tip 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.560
 be careful that the upper body 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.419
 remains of the upper arm is back here at 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.340
 biceps cologne to look for anything 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.660
 and the third tip that is he hanged 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:43.520
 at all uses eccentric loads 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:49.060
 that is the eccentric load 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.060
 not this burden but this one 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.150
 the muscle stretch is exactly what the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.700
 Muscle structure eccentric load 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.130
 muscle stretched is attractive to build 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.320
 that's the third tip and the one 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.940
 absolute secret to the massive 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.190
 build biceps 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.500
 clean technology, the three tips you have 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.450
 does not include a jump upper arm on the body and 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.550
 use eccentric load intensively 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.280
 I hope you are completely concerned about her 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.360
 You will see that the whole thing will be rewarded with 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.950
 Success See you in the next video 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.950
 many greetings your room
