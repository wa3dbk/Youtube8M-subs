00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.580 
played by Hiro Santiago Cabrera it looks
a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.930> may<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.410> used

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a little bit like they may have used

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
a little bit like they may have used
some<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.010> ideas<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.879> developing<00:01:03.480> Jason

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
scheme maybe the armor design a little

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640 
scheme maybe the armor design a little
bit<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.909> uh<00:01:11.939> Jason<00:01:12.630> Momoa<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.140> definitely

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bit but uh Jason Momoa is definitely

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410
