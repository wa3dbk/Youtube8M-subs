us<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.249> this<00:00:53.399> type<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.149> we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
us that do this type of thing I think we

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
us that do this type of thing I think we
usually<00:00:54.839> do<00:00:55.019> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.409> that's<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
usually do I think that's one of the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.919 
usually do I think that's one of the
things<00:00:56.249> that<00:00:56.519> drives<00:00:56.879> us<00:00:57.179> to<00:00:57.359> do<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.659> type<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.079 
things that drives us to do this type of
work<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.249> overcoming<00:00:59.999> those

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.710 
thing and it's not just the repair
profession<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.360> every<00:02:56.450> profession

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.660 
profession I think in every profession
there's<00:02:57.200> people<00:02:57.500> who<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.829> sort<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.130> punch

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
there's people who just sort of punch

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.520 
there's people who just sort of punch
the<00:02:58.819> clock<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.269> then<00:02:59.569> watch<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.019> clock<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the clock and then watch the clock and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.930 
the clock and then watch the clock and
and<00:03:01.160> that's<00:03:01.340> what<00:03:01.489> they're<00:03:01.640> doing<00:03:01.670> they're

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
and that's what they're doing they're

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.150 
and that's what they're doing they're
just<00:03:02.329> they're<00:03:03.019> basically<00:03:03.380> passing<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> time

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
just they're basically passing the time

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.830 
just they're basically passing the time
so<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.790> collect<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.150> check<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.569> go<00:03:05.690> do

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
so that I can collect a check and go do

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.890 
so that I can collect a check and go do
something<00:03:05.870> else<00:03:06.319> okay<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.360> we're<00:03:08.569> not<00:03:08.690> all

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
something else okay and we're not all

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.580 
something else okay and we're not all

holds something down that may not be

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.699 
holds something down that may not be
critical<00:03:31.069> but<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:32.450> completes<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.230> job<00:03:33.470> in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709

whole point you go into repair you're

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.500 
whole point you go into repair you're
hoping<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:40.670> better<00:03:40.850> than<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.150> was<00:03:41.299> when

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.140 
hoping it's better than it was when
you're<00:03:41.690> when<00:03:42.380> you're<00:03:42.410> done<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.880> think<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
you're when you're done and I think a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.580 
you're when you're done and I think a
lot<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.540> comes<00:03:44.840> from<00:03:44.930> detail<00:03:45.380> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
lot of that comes from detail and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.160 
lot of that comes from detail and
detail-oriented<00:03:46.340> people<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:47.030> think<00:03:47.090> are<00:03:47.450> are

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
detail-oriented people I think are are

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.199 
detail-oriented people I think are are
very<00:03:48.230> good<00:03:48.709> at<00:03:48.829> this<00:03:48.980> type<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.250> work<00:03:49.609> because

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
very good at this type of work because

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.479 
very good at this type of work because
there<00:03:50.510> are<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> lot<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.109> tiny<00:03:51.889> little<00:03:52.100> bits<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
there are a lot of tiny little bits and

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.069 
there are a lot of tiny little bits and
pieces<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:53.090> need<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.389> deal<00:03:53.569> with<00:03:53.599> and

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
pieces that you need to deal with and

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.780 
pieces that you need to deal with and
and<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:54.410> can<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.680> frustrating<00:03:54.889> at<00:03:55.250> times<00:03:55.280> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and that can be frustrating at times and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.550 
and that can be frustrating at times and
sometimes<00:03:56.420> it's<00:03:56.630> easy<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.930> say<00:03:57.139> you<00:03:57.200> know<00:03:57.380> what

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
sometimes it's easy to say you know what

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.020 
sometimes it's easy to say you know what
