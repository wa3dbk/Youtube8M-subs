bartsch<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.300> bart<00:01:03.570> strategy<00:01:04.140> actually

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
bartsch but the bart strategy actually

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
bartsch but the bart strategy actually
works<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.670> basis

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
works really well on the little basis

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.510 
works really well on the little basis
because<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:07.020> level<00:01:07.290> mortars<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:08.220> kill

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
because at that level mortars don't kill

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070 
because at that level mortars don't kill
your<00:01:08.640> guys<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.300> hit<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> mean<00:01:09.600> look<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:09.930> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
your guys in one hit I mean look at this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
your guys in one hit I mean look at this
it<00:01:10.350> takes<00:01:10.800> like<00:01:11.070> three<00:01:11.430> four<00:01:11.850> hits<00:01:12.120> for<00:01:12.330> those

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
it takes like three four hits for those

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.480 
it takes like three four hits for those
barbarians<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> even<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.500> killed<00:01:14.220> by<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
barbarians to even get killed by a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
barbarians to even get killed by a
single<00:01:14.850> mortar<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.290> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.410> worry

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
single mortar so you don't need to worry

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
single mortar so you don't need to worry
too<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.070> barbs<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.700> archers<00:01:18.060> being

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
could take them out so as long as you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
could take them out so as long as you

Giants and barbarians and archers which
is<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.380> effective<00:02:25.920> strategy<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:27.030> here

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
is really effective strategy but here

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720 
is really effective strategy but here
you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.569> see<00:02:27.780> he<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.500> working<00:02:29.010> his<00:02:29.220> way<00:02:29.280> into

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
you can see he is working his way into

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.729 
you can see he is working his way into
the<00:02:29.970> base<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.870> Town<00:02:31.110> Hall<00:02:31.380> always

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the base going for that Town Hall always

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.170 
the base going for that Town Hall always
got<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.190> get<00:02:32.310> through<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.700> more<00:02:32.910> wall

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
got to do is get through one more wall

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.690 
got to do is get through one more wall
let's<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.569> how<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.720> goes<00:02:34.040> pretty<00:02:35.040> easy<00:02:35.370> base

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
let's see how it goes pretty easy base

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
let's see how it goes pretty easy base
though<00:02:36.030> nothing<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> worry<00:02:36.840> about<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.380> my

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
though nothing to worry about in my

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.949 
though nothing to worry about in my
opinion<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.099> pretty<00:02:38.370> sure<00:02:38.610> those<00:02:38.819> giants<00:02:39.720> by

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
opinion I'm pretty sure those giants by

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.800 
opinion I'm pretty sure those giants by
themselves<00:02:40.470> could<00:02:40.709> pretty<00:02:40.920> much<00:02:41.040> take<00:02:41.400> out

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
themselves could pretty much take out

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.080 
themselves could pretty much take out
75%<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> base<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.890> nothing<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> worry<00:02:44.670> about<00:02:44.730> he

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
75% of base so nothing to worry about he

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940 
75% of base so nothing to worry about he
does<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> couple<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> goblins<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.769> which

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
does have a couple of goblins here which

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.500 
does have a couple of goblins here which
he's<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> use<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.730> take<00:02:47.910> out<00:02:48.090> all<00:02:48.300> that

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
he's going to use to take out all that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.570 
he's going to use to take out all that
gold<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.050> there's<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> much<00:02:50.250> showing

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
gold and there's not that much showing

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.370 
gold and there's not that much showing
guys<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.690> he's<00:02:51.840> win<00:02:52.019> their<00:02:52.200> lap

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
guys so it's not like he's win their lap

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.449 
guys so it's not like he's win their lap
but<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.620> don't<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:52.950> he<00:02:53.010> lost<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.400> thing

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
but I don't think he lost a thing

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.100 
but I don't think he lost a thing
because<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.510> an<00:02:54.630> expensive

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
because if you this is not an expensive

and destroy them now somehow this is

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.509 
and destroy them now somehow this is
actually<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.959> lowest<00:03:22.170> level<00:03:22.709> I've<00:03:22.830> seen<00:03:23.220> a

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
actually the lowest level I've seen a

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.960 
actually the lowest level I've seen a
gold<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.480> versus<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.110> gold<00:03:25.410> 3<00:03:25.799> where<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.609> gold

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
gold one versus a gold 3 where the gold

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.780 
gold one versus a gold 3 where the gold
one<00:03:27.209> can<00:03:27.480> lose<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.620> many<00:03:28.799> trophies<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.519> thought

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
one can lose so many trophies I thought

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.190 
one can lose so many trophies I thought
they<00:03:29.940> had<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.209> higher<00:03:30.359> than<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.720> but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
they had to be higher than that but

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.410 
they had to be higher than that but
apparently<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:32.100> wrong<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.730> happens<00:03:33.269> once

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
apparently I was wrong it happens once

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.120
