hey guys it's d flash and we're back for
another<00:00:14.370> look<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.849> our<00:00:14.880> Ableton<00:00:15.360> Live<00:00:15.509> devices

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
another look at our Ableton Live devices

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.870 
another look at our Ableton Live devices
this<00:00:16.440> week<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.340> EQ

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
this week we're going to look at EQ

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
this week we're going to look at EQ
three<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> how<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> use<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.529> filter<00:00:19.740> our

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
three and how to use it to filter our

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.370 
three and how to use it to filter our
music<00:00:20.630> so<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> drag<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> onto

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
music so we're going to drag it onto

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.360 
music so we're going to drag it onto
this<00:00:22.650> track

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
this track

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.090 
this track
and<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:25.750> looking<00:00:25.990> at<00:00:26.080> EQ<00:00:26.500> 3<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.770> can<00:00:26.920> see

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
and from looking at EQ 3 you can see

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.650 
and from looking at EQ 3 you can see
that's<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:28.330> your<00:00:28.630> standard<00:00:29.460> DJ<00:00:30.460> EQ<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.360> you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
that's like your standard DJ EQ so you

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.180 
that's like your standard DJ EQ so you
got<00:00:31.810> your<00:00:31.960> lows<00:00:32.169> you're<00:00:32.500> missing<00:00:32.860> your<00:00:32.980> highs

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
got your lows you're missing your highs

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.979 
got your lows you're missing your highs
and<00:00:33.489> then<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.989> have<00:00:35.200> your<00:00:35.670> low-cut<00:00:36.670> mid<00:00:37.660> cut

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
and then you have your low-cut mid cut

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.390 
and then you have your low-cut mid cut
and<00:00:38.230> high<00:00:38.650> cut<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:40.000> LEDs<00:00:40.570> up<00:00:40.750> here<00:00:41.400> indicate

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
and high cut these LEDs up here indicate

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.640 
and high cut these LEDs up here indicate
that<00:00:42.940> if<00:00:43.629> there's<00:00:43.809> activity<00:00:44.290> on<00:00:44.320> those

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
that if there's activity on those

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.369 
that if there's activity on those
frequencies<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.989> set<00:00:47.260> your

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
frequencies and these set your

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.979 
frequencies and these set your
crossovers<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.250> your<00:00:48.370> EQ<00:00:48.790> s<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.540> this<00:00:49.750> sets

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
crossovers for your EQ s so this sets

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.140 
crossovers for your EQ s so this sets
your<00:00:50.140> low<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:51.370> sets<00:00:51.550> your<00:00:51.670> high<00:00:51.820> and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
your low and this sets your high and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.020 
your low and this sets your high and
then<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.530> also<00:00:53.860> will<00:00:54.190> adjust<00:00:54.460> your<00:00:54.670> mitts

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
then that also will adjust your mitts

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.900 
then that also will adjust your mitts
so<00:00:55.180> as<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.480> raise<00:00:55.690> this<00:00:55.960> your<00:00:56.739> mid<00:00:56.920> start<00:00:57.309> at<00:00:57.820> a

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
so as you raise this your mid start at a

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.270 
so as you raise this your mid start at a
higher<00:00:58.180> frequency<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.710> lower<00:00:59.890> frequency

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
higher frequency or a lower frequency

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.079 
higher frequency or a lower frequency
and<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.870> set<00:01:02.140> your<00:01:02.320> filter<00:01:02.770> modes<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.969> can

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
and these set your filter modes you can

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.070 
and these set your filter modes you can
either<00:01:04.270> have<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.479> 24<00:01:04.960> DB<00:01:05.320> filter<00:01:05.800> or<00:01:06.780> 48:48<00:01:07.780> just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
either have a 24 DB filter or 48:48 just

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.870 
either have a 24 DB filter or 48:48 just
ends<00:01:08.770> up<00:01:08.860> being<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.220> more<00:01:09.520> drastic<00:01:09.820> cut<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:11.880> but

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
ends up being a more drastic cut and but

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.359 
ends up being a more drastic cut and but
it<00:01:13.060> does<00:01:13.270> result<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:14.009> more<00:01:15.009> CPU<00:01:15.610> uses<00:01:15.910> more<00:01:16.149> CPU

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it does result in more CPU uses more CPU

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.980 
it does result in more CPU uses more CPU
so<00:01:18.369> we're<00:01:18.729> going<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.910> kick<00:01:19.119> on<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.420> music<00:01:19.780> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
so we're going to kick on the music and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.480 
so we're going to kick on the music and
play<00:01:20.320> around<00:01:20.440> with<00:01:20.619> some<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> knobs<00:01:21.160> and

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
play around with some of the knobs and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:33.779 
play around with some of the knobs and
see<00:01:22.330> how<00:01:22.539> it<00:01:22.600> sounds<00:01:31.050> ok<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.530> here's<00:01:33.459> your<00:01:33.610> low

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
see how it sounds ok so here's your low

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:51.520 
see how it sounds ok so here's your low
cut<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:37.000> adjust<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> crossover

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.250 

and<00:01:52.340> use<00:01:52.550> your<00:01:52.580> mitts<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:55.570> here's<00:01:56.570> why<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.080> was

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
and use your mitts and here's why I was

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:05.290 
and use your mitts and here's why I was
only<00:01:57.410> adjust<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> filter<00:01:58.190> switch<00:02:04.120> just<00:02:05.120> show

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
only adjust the filter switch just show

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:41.550 
only adjust the filter switch just show
some<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.080> little<00:02:06.410> bit<00:02:06.530> more<00:02:06.740> drastic

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.890 

and<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:42.920> pretty<00:02:43.100> much<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.430> q3<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.330> only

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
and that's pretty much it q3 the only

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.930 
and that's pretty much it q3 the only
thing<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> would<00:02:45.380> say<00:02:45.560> about<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.310> it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
thing that I would say about is that it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.199 
thing that I would say about is that it
does<00:02:47.150> color<00:02:47.480> your<00:02:47.780> sound<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.880> turn<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
does color your sound so if you turn it

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.130 
does color your sound so if you turn it
off<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.570> on<00:02:52.540> you'll<00:02:53.540> notice<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> slight

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
off and on you'll notice the slight

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.039 
off and on you'll notice the slight
changing<00:02:54.650> your<00:02:54.770> sound<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.870> don't

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
changing your sound but if you don't

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.759 
changing your sound but if you don't
mind<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.380> then<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.950> feel<00:02:58.700> free<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.940> use<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
mind that then you feel free to use it

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.780 
mind that then you feel free to use it
if<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:00.920> any<00:03:01.040> questions<00:03:01.400> feel<00:03:01.610> free<00:03:01.640> to
