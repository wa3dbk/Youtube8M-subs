00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.269
 again more and next time I make a 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.339
 I salute like this, I'll have to leave 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.680
 I'll have to go to the bathroom because I'll have 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.539
 shit from as much as is said of so much of 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.430
 so many in front of so much pressure at 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.430
 composed of so much effort that 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 showdown directshow they give a game of 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.650
 cars like another we are not going to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.559
 explain the car games as they are and 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:48.530
 also as you know in my colleagues of 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.530
 clan let's say do not start do not start 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.030
 well you know already know mackinnon bike 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.690
 for only immolate g which are a few cases two 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 mental 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.960
 this game is this game mode like 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.610
 I like to say friend is head to head 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.840
 I think it's a race if at par 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.840
 the best time 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.500
 and also during the road you have to 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.500
 you have to do a couple of tricks 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.439
 as I skid 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.550
 why 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.220
 although not for today we have 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.220
 lost 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.950
 jump 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.950
 terra I thought now this 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.979
 I dont know 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.340
 I do not know yet, I have to talk, I think it's 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340
 call 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.150
 what a bastard 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.820
 is to observe 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.969
 it does not matter anymore you know you can not devote 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.969
 perfectly 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.050
 it's a change 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.420
 I want to see this 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.219
 great a round of applause for me and my team 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.219
 withdrawn because why 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.250
 I have made a group of 12 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.940
 these game modes are not what 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.940
 our that there are 2 to 2 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.730
 we want by ebro donuts 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.160
 this time as I already know what the game is about 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.850
 and now I 'm going to put more 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.850
 batteries 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.840
 I'm going to put the batteries 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.239
 good be primitive with 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.239
 I'm always wrong god 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.320
 here not your car 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.360
 but I think I have a shot here 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.040
 I have a machine in front 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.760
 I lost here 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.760
 I have here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.030
 fuck 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.970
 I do not think the time if I want 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.970
 I should look at the time 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:59.610
 let's see let's see the great construction 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:04.990
 of best 4 we go 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:09.700
 first came to me the apocalypse came 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:14.340
 came the spin but guys are not very 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.829
 exciting these gameplays but not 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.829
 opposition before opposition before 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.389
 good but we also wanted to do all 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.930
 the game games in this comeback already 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.999

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.260

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.440

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.390
 let's not start saying that I hope you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.040

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.340

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.710

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.480
