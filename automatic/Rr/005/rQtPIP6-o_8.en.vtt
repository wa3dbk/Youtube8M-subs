00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 hello everyone is welcome 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 on my channel so before introducing myself 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269
 just to tell you that I put you a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.250
 little gameplay are they 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.810
 gameplay on black ops twice a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 magic part but I realize when 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 same part not too bad I do not receive 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 all the material to record so 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 I did not have much in stock that I 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 put you alone there I hope she 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 you will like it anyway so that I 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 introduce me adriq title to you you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.670
 can call me adrien if you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 wish I'm 20 years old to repeat I'm in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.530
 3rd year of design degree 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.890
 mechanical taxes the size not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.539
 and I play on xbox so to come back 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.730
 to my channel as you can in you 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.860
 see it will be dedicated to games 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.440
 video and so to do in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.909
 the utmost originality I'm going 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.710
 as a first step introduce yourself to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.940
 conference which is what what about code 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.659
 gameplay that will be I think 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.340
 commented on small video montages I 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.110
 not bad the idea also videos in mind 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.640
 which could be very nice but 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.020
 I do not tell you more for the moment 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 really should that first that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.080
 I learn to manage well all 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 editing software 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 what I would also like is that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.890
 this chain is basically a support 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.190
 self-help between gamer so it's up to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 to say that they can allow to 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.380
 find subscribers and realize 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.440
 challenges and successes and paralyze 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 emblems and therefore knows how to proceed 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.729
 you that if the idea envy comes from me 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.409
 I'll let you know who has a video 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 and you in the comments you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 indicate who is leaving and therefore 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.140
 I will train teams 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.869
 if ever you are more than one can 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.729
 to make several teams and suitcases I 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.869
 could do the challenge several times 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 with several people 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860
 but I will obviously not post all 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.049
 the videos i will post mans part 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.150
 which will be the most successful the most fun one 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.600
 will say and so why not do it 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.670
 a series 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.739
 so I would really like this idea 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 is developing because that would allow 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.820
 to all people like me who 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.940
 have no active or perform 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.500
 challenges we'll say almost impossible to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.970
 to do if we do not have to eat sitting 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.970
 not all the delegates have 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.739
 the same goal that I think especially 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.320
 to the challenges in domination having the 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.980
 three points for three minutes 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.900
 but hey we could for example 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.910
 achieve nuclear medals do 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.280
 carnage to several and so it's 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.799
 it could really be nice if I went 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.269
 forget so if ever the idea comes from 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.459
 you and want to achieve 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.799
 one or other of that particular success 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.150
 you yourself describe me in the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.920
 comments that I will read well 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.450
 obviously is a game would make pass 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000
 then announce it so the same in a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.730
 video and of course for the purpose of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.890
 build a team to succeed 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.630
 little challenge so that's it I'm done 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.490
 the code part that ours for the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.770
 future project yes I'm waiting with 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.890
 looking forward to the release of gears of war 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.370
 judgment hoping that the live be 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.740
 new york a single 8 go 3g not too much 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.010
 hooked on gow3's particular live caused 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.300
 a good weather wave is ripe 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.950
 so I really hope you got him 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.110
 will be better so what I you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.870
 will propose on these wars it's I 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.590
 think a test is an adventure followed by 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.170
 the campaign surely comes to 4 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.080
 so here I am also waiting the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.850
 walking dead hoping that activation 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.290
 do not go out a dung since I 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.750
 would be really disappointed if I'm a little 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.650
 a fan of the series also so a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.480
 another chronicle that I would like 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.880
 developed on my channel came true 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.320
 gaming tests but it was I did not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.940
 want to do it alone 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.130
 well call on I do not know 3,4 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.380
 subscribers no more than 5 for 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.700
 pass alone brothel and so that all the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.030
 world can offer its point of view 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.959
 of the default relay the trumps of the game and I 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.600
 think it could be really 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.680
 interesting to have several points of 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.810
 view of different people 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 rather than the life of one of a single 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.570
 someone who not necessarily really 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.940
 objective 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.070
 so why not see people 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.140
 coming from different media lends itself 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.030
 really interesting and that would allow 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.489
 I think better of hesitant people 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.790
 on the purchase of quality game learn 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.919
 more 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.360
 so here I hope this idea is going 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.800
 to really please you and that she will 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.000
 develop one because I think that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.600
 it could really be nice of 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.940
 to achieve that is to many what 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.980
 else if I'm trying to 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.840
 to make an intro there and the intrigued 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.400
 you will see on the video is not terrible 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.530
 but first of all really that I learn 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.450
 to understand and learn how 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.700
 use the editing software and 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.200
 modelization 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.690
 so I have a lot of tutorials in 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.620
 this moment I also count 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.260
 improved size controls and they think 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.120
 that I am not necessarily super natural 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.590
 talking to us but hey I'm skiing well this 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 so I really hope there progressed 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.720
 in and hope you serve indulgent 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.970
 on the first video so bah I have 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.920
 finished the presentation so small 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.480
 recap say that I would like 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.990
 really develop so two points 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.270
 especially it's really it's my channel 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.850
 either place a support of them 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.590
 between gamer so especially on call of 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.790
 duty but not necessarily that on this 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.330
 game and I really wish that this 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.360
 chronic about multi- boss tests 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.980
 is developing so obviously I do not 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.780
 will not do that as video as I 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.580
 wanted to say i 'll do kemp the montages 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.260
 concluded to videos will say more 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.880
 conventional but I will always try 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.500
 d bring my touch 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.260
 story to bring originality 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.880
 So here in the video I have finished the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.890
 presentation of if you can also 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.630
 follow me on my twitter account that I 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.910
 will put the link in description so 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.710
 especially to be aware of 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.560
 next videos that are organized in 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.020
 line et cetera go here I think in 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.220
 have finished and that this first video 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.710
 I hope that what I will propose you 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.880
 will please and that will lead you to develop the 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.450
 two points that require your 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.540
 involvement and that especially test them 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.550
 and the support of help so here we go 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.860
 I finished so I tell you more these 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.860
 hunks and girls very obvious in leo
