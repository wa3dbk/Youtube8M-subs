00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:13.440
 shit all nice guys back here 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.240
 makes cup to the agis look and with a new one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 video on clash of class in which vi 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.689
 I will show an arrangement for town vol 9 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 wars and therefore for the clamor with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 new fly that this defense here that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.840
 we see that it has recently been implemented 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 in the game I try to upload the video 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.290
 even as soon as possible if you do n't load it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.000
 on the same day that exit of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 update the load 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
 the next day so the boys hope to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.969
 be as timely as possible 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 let's talk about this defense 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.399
 see that it can rotate and in practice the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 its operation is to push 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.710
 all the air defenses that separate them 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.489
 within the radius that we can excuse today 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 see now we see it quite well 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.039
 here is very very large and we have a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.630
 available eight vanishing points where 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.549
 we can turn our flywheel 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 showerhead and korca as the heck is called 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.119
 let's take a look at the war base ed 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.799
 is the one I designed is 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.540
 practically very similar to a base of 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.920
 war he had already brought and with the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.189
 which I feel great 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 only problem is very weak against the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.500
 in fact air defenses are against excuses 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 in fact, air attacks attack 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.490
 however the film especially from this 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 side and from this side there is from 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.369
 worry 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 I found the solution that of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.990
 enter our flight not here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.060
 now I try to zoom in on a sea 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.070
 out to show you the whole arrangement 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.530
 in its entirety so that if you want 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.619
 copy the video you have it clear 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 clear and very clear however you see 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.770
 who placed it here where it was first 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 empty and its task 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 I turned it to this part like 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.399
 you can see right towards the town hall 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.069
 his job is if people go off the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.110
 hot air balloons on this side 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.350
 as you can see once that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.840
 reach the air defenses come 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.580
 inter on the outside of course does not have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.620
 a great impact 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.020
 after a while they can reach 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 however, the task is precisely air defense 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.390
 that of rejecting the farthest 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.490
 possible 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 another hope is that if they do not take 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.910
 these mines that are here 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 probably once they come 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.600
 blow further they change course and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.520
 hit these thousand air e 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.190
 of course this is very lucky 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.500
 how what the base is this anyway 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.850
 I hope you saw it 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.380
 I hope you can copy it nothing is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.510
 good against earth attacks was 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 less good against flying attacks 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.860
 so I decided to implement 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.780
 this showerhead that he shot from this 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.850
 part and I hope it really makes us 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.560
 I will try effective in the war 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.240
 keep up to date by writing to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.370
 channel or following my videos 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.230
 and I will tell you how this base of war goes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.240
 given you do it and we'll see you all at 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.750
 next thanks for watching mine 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.750
 nice videos
