fan which surprises me how heavy these
fans<00:00:46.590> actually<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> lot<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
fans actually are they have a lot of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.150 
fans actually are they have a lot of
substantial<00:00:49.170> weight<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:49.559> had<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> few

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
substantial weight I've had quite a few

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.750 
substantial weight I've had quite a few
fans<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:51.629> building<00:00:52.050> days<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.770> I've

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
fans and my building days here and I've

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
fans and my building days here and I've
never<00:00:54.120> come<00:00:54.300> across<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> fan<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.020> weighs<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
never come across a fan that weighs this

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.160 
never come across a fan that weighs this
much<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.760> rubber<00:00:57.000> Isolators<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
much they have rubber Isolators all the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.099 
much they have rubber Isolators all the
way<00:00:58.260> around<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> outside<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.670> are

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
way around the outside and they are

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
way around the outside and they are
literally<00:01:01.109> screwed<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
literally screwed right on to the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.910 
literally screwed right on to the
outside<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> frame<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.589> their

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
outside of the frame they have their

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.660 
outside of the frame they have their
these<00:01:05.400> particular<00:01:06.270> ones<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.840> lit<00:01:07.619> white<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
these particular ones are lit white the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
these particular ones are lit white the
lighting<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> inside<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> hub

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
lighting is on the inside of the hub

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
lighting is on the inside of the hub
which<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> unique<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:11.909> most<00:01:12.119> fans<00:01:12.630> are

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
which is unique because most fans are

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
which is unique because most fans are
actually<00:01:12.900> lit<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> outside<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
actually lit from the outside and this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
actually lit from the outside and this
gives<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.960> even<00:01:16.920> even<00:01:17.549> light

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
gives it a very very even even light

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179 
gives it a very very even even light
coverage<00:01:18.240> anyway<00:01:19.080> I'll<00:01:19.229> turn<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.770> let

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
coverage anyway I'll turn them on let

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.859 
coverage anyway I'll turn them on let
you<00:01:20.310> hear<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.790> let<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.420> him<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you hear them let you see him and you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.510 
you hear them let you see him and you
can<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> decision<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:24.140> as

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
can make a decision on what you think as

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
can make a decision on what you think as
you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:27.630> powerful<00:01:27.869> fan

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you can see they are very powerful fan

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
you can see they are very powerful fan
you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> box<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.280> moving<00:01:29.610> around<00:01:29.729> in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you can see the box is moving around in

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
you can see the box is moving around in
the<00:01:30.030> background<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.720> those<00:01:31.439> boxes<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.369> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the background a bit those boxes do have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
the background a bit those boxes do have
fans<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.780> moving<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
fans in them they are moving like that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
fans in them they are moving like that
the<00:01:35.280> fan<00:01:35.490> does<00:01:35.520> appear<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.390> rather<00:01:36.630> blue<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the fan does appear to be rather blue in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.749 
the fan does appear to be rather blue in
this<00:01:37.290> image<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.920> assure<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this image but I assure you it is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.789 
this image but I assure you it is
definitely<00:01:39.659> white<00:01:40.619> white<00:01:42.020> they<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.500> touch

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
definitely white white they are a touch

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
definitely white white they are a touch
on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.009> lots<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.610> outside<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.450> not

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
on the lots little outside I have not

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.149 
on the lots little outside I have not
installed<00:01:45.899> these<00:01:46.170> yet<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:47.009> how

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
installed these yet so I don't know how

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
installed these yet so I don't know how
well<00:01:47.399> they'll<00:01:47.780> work<00:01:48.780> under<00:01:49.140> pulse<00:01:49.920> width

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
well they'll work under pulse width

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.789 
well they'll work under pulse width
modulation<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.590> would

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
modulation but I would think that would

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
modulation but I would think that would
do<00:01:52.979> rather<00:01:53.310> well<00:01:55.219> I<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> currently<00:01:57.540> out

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
do rather well I have the currently out

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
do rather well I have the currently out
of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> fan<00:01:58.079> tied<00:01:58.409> down<00:01:58.649> by<00:01:58.890> its<00:01:59.040> cable<00:01:59.280> here

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of the fan tied down by its cable here

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.539 
of the fan tied down by its cable here
in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> back<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.100> one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
in the back I had to do that because one

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
in the back I had to do that because one
if<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.939> didn't<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> fan<00:02:03.719> would<00:02:03.869> literally<00:02:04.229> just

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
if I didn't the fan would literally just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
if I didn't the fan would literally just
push<00:02:04.710> itself<00:02:05.009> across<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> table<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
push itself across the table here and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.919 
push itself across the table here and
would<00:02:06.509> fall<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:06.780> eventually<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:09.750> gives

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
would fall over eventually so that gives

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.270 
would fall over eventually so that gives
you<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> idea<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:10.979> air

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you a pretty good idea how much air

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.570 
you a pretty good idea how much air
these

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
these

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.850 
these
actually<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.630> move<00:02:12.840> I'm<00:02:13.470> gonna<00:02:13.710> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
actually really do move I'm gonna be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
actually really do move I'm gonna be
using<00:02:14.160> six<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.390> build<00:02:15.600> on

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
using six of these in a build on

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.800 
using six of these in a build on
