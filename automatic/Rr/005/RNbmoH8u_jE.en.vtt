everyone<00:01:51.689> spins<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.409> days<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> grind

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
everyone spins these days if you grind

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
everyone spins these days if you grind
you<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.180> drops<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> spinners<00:01:56.130> are

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you get drops because the spinners are

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
you get drops because the spinners are
going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.729> efficient<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.500> when

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to be more efficient than you when

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
going to be more efficient than you when
you<00:01:58.619> spin<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.130> burn<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.520> fat<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you spin your burn more fat than you

burn<00:02:00.360> sugar<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.140> grinding<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> burn<00:02:01.950> your

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
burn sugar so grinding you burn your

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
burn sugar so grinding you burn your
Sugar's<00:02:02.369> quicker<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.420> means<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> have

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
Sugar's quicker which means you have

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.679 
Sugar's quicker which means you have
less<00:02:04.200> stamina<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.490> spin<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> lot

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
less stamina so if your spin it's a lot

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.889 
less stamina so if your spin it's a lot
easier<00:02:07.399> dr.<00:02:08.399> Ferrari<00:02:08.759> always<00:02:09.149> says<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.660> you're

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
easier dr. Ferrari always says if you're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.559 
easier dr. Ferrari always says if you're
spinning<00:02:10.379> over<00:02:10.619> 90<00:02:10.979> cadence<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:12.660> blood

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
spinning over 90 cadence you you blood

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.509 
spinning over 90 cadence you you blood
axes<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.049> peripheral<00:02:14.530> pump<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.430> you

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
axes like a peripheral pump because you

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.099 
axes like a peripheral pump because you
just<00:02:15.640> circulating<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.329> lot<00:02:16.480> easier<00:02:16.810> than<00:02:16.959> if

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
just circulating a lot easier than if

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and went off the front there because if

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940 
and went off the front there because if
you<00:02:43.269> attack<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.599> hard<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.499> caught<00:02:44.709> yet

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
you attack that hard you get caught yet

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.379 
you attack that hard you get caught yet
maybe<00:02:45.099> attacking<00:02:45.579> again<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.180> went

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
maybe attacking again so you just went

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.770

I think he actually is a track rider but

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.050 
I think he actually is a track rider but
it<00:03:32.470> looks<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> track<00:03:33.099> or<00:03:33.250> doesn't<00:03:33.489> he<00:03:33.579> high
