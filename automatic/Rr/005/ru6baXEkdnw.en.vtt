 Biscuit missed you later. 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 15 days of sauce 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 So I want to start here. 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.090
 thanking the people who sent the fleet 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 to home box on facebook the staff of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 group of biscuit your affection 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.369
 very cool everybody cheering for 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 Come back fast and in class today I'm going 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.750
 to teach you a detail to use with 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 Evening at stake a custom doll 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 what is going to be the scarton and pitu shoe 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 with potato 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.410
 I'm going to teach everything the whole leg and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.739
 then use apathy 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 I already have the skin tone more or 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 At least three centimeters and I've got mail . 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.149
 formatted as a secure format 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.149
 elongated 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.760
 This mine is giving more or less 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.009
 eight centimeters in length 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.049
 I'll get the tip here 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.440
 I'm going to give a distance of more or less 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 one centimeter and I'll start tuning 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.880
 generating my fingers here 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.110
 This tip here I'll put out 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.090
 out of my hand and I will finish tuning the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 rest here this leg got balls 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.570
 out 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 leg compliance right now does not 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.679
 It matters more because the excess after me 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 I can cut 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.229
 I'll concentrate more here on the little foot. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.909
 laying here aside 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 I'm going to give a little squeeze some orders 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.869
 accordingly wet my thumb 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.869
 face to face 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.500
 I'll take this finger here, I'll give it to you. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 sink from her squeezing in fear of 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 Up the little toe is just feeling 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.239
 support and I'll start modeling the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.280
 my character 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.000
 here our part since it got more 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 high 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.360
 this part of the tip here I'll put the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 most back here now to support 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.640
 this one down here and will support 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.160
 who's going to work is the little toe and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.050
 I'm going to make a fond childhood of this point that 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:01.090
 I like to bring a little foot of 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 ballerina and now one tuned to 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.670
 form that shoe shape a lot 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.530
 great your foot 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:17.800
 You can cut the excess down here. 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:20.380
 using my little treasure and the point here 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.990
 I turn up because she's going to be 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.130
 Jump high then imagine who gets in 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.950
 foot 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.630
 the little jump is coming out here and the little point 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.630
 foot like that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.960
 and if from here how it will be a little shoe 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.250
 I hope that the one who leaves the 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.530
 finger off 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.990
 I will not make it go up because much 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.280
 tuned if it was a whole scarpin 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.530
 closed 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.780
 I already told you to show why the front 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:13.660
 good end but this one I'm leaving 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:15.850
 slightly rounded place the leg 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.120
 always so someone in thesis is for you 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.120
 see the format the correct position 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.920
 if you need to know that Brazil is going to go 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.600
 turning her all over for you 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.600
 see if there's anything crooked 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.920
 I'm going to turn her on her back or 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.550
 less in the middle of the land I will support it 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.960
 mark the coast here will be to 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.750
 a belly on the leg 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.390
 I'm going to sink a little here to 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.340
 to separate the marquinha from the knee 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:02.890
 Actually the knee is in front of this 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:07.140
 adobe which is longer leg marquinhos 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.140
 modeling here will walk from the belly 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.410
 and here I already do here in front of 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.410
 knee marking 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:43.169
 but making a fondness to soften 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:45.389
 all the fingerprints that are left 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.880
 Do you want to bookmark here? 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.880
 using more technique stays cool 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.490
 and then the clear position will be according to 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:13.030
 with the part you are doing in the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.020
 night the deputy before a little hole 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.180
 custom imports 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.710
 It can get strained. 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.000
 be a bent leg 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.729
 there you will position the way you 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.520
 need according to your need 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:35.599
 I'm going to put this leg of the way 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:38.150
 which is on top because if I put 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.969
 she straight on the table goes to xata 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.400
 So I'll put her first 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.199
 satin because the city will not stick 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.870
 will leave no type of marquinhos no 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.770
 Are you going to come back then it's gonna be okay? 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.110
 right 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.229
 let her arrive at least a bit 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:58.069
 here in the outside of a cone she 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:00.319
 start to stay outside in 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:02.960
 in the inside will be in the field 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:05.539
 with one line and without needing depending 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.000
 of the part you are going to make you can 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.539
 pass a structure the daily oven of 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.430
 toothpick and then to make the shoe there 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.199
 I recommend that you leave after 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.879
 already finished that he already put a toothpick 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.089
 already made everything structured 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.729
 You leave both days to be well. 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:24.680
 thin little foot is firm for 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:29.110
 easier to assemble the 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.110
 shoe without damaging the shape of the foot
