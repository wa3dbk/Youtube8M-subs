00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 d'agosto pereira on the suspended side 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.500
 we will have to make a result at the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 house for a team that had very 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 well started in August but who 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500
 stays on four draws 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.670
 consecutive 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 the first training to get started 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.830
 action 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 it's dijon with a first strike 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 repulsed by kerboriou the guardian of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.949
 second chance crying goal with this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.230
 center is the point-blank recovery 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's still saved by the keeper 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.190
 huge cristolian dijon dominance 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.649
 outside in this early match 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.920
 this cleared ball passes right next to the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.210
 goal against his side was not far 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.520
 still a possibility for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 Burgundians inspired the balloon rolled up 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 at the second post 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 the delivery and purpose of zakaria diallo to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.789
 the 25th minute a deserved goal for the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.500
 dijonnais this is the first goal of the 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.450
 season for zakaria diallo a team of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.110
 dijon deprived of love and souprayen a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 injured and that makes a very good match to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 outdoors 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 and yet in three games played at 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.820
 outside since the beginning of the season 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.310
 dijon did not win any creteil 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.329
 try to come back with this balloon that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.600
 misses 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.100
 very few opportunities for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.880
 logically half time it is well dijon 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 who leads 1 0 a team of cranks 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 yet undefeated at home in three 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.899
 matches played in front of his audience 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.899
 we will have to react in the second half 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 the cristolians who is accelerating with this 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.430
 ball in the penalty area the 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.640
 meaning between the point blank 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.970
 for cheikh d'oye the Senegalese player 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 scored the goal of a everywhere at the 53rd 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 minute 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 it's already his fourth of the season 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.070
 but dijon do not let it count 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.420
 a new head up then this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.500
 opportunity that is the right one for 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 take back the advantage 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.830

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.330
 thil in the 66th minute 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.440
 dijon confirms its renewal of form 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.130
 since a few weeks 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 unbeaten for four matches 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 the Dijonnais who are close to 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.710
 concede a new equalization to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.530
 but that resists it is saved on 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.510
 line 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.660
 still katia the initiatives and this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.420
 balloon is diverted into the small net at 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.900
 the outside of the goal 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.960
 dijon resists and will do better than 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.360
 resist and keep the Buzeins 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.220
