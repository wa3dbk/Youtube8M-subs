we're finished with the design of the

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.450 
we're finished with the design of the
manager<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:54.040> last

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
growing to like it more and more every

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.990 
growing to like it more and more every
day<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.850> it's<00:04:07.600> been<00:04:08.140> replacing<00:04:08.980> such<00:04:09.640> beasts

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
day and it's been replacing such beasts
