for everybody the fashional animation

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
for everybody the fashional animation
that's<00:01:19.260> something<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:20.070> difficult

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that's something that is quite difficult

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
that's something that is quite difficult
to<00:01:20.550> achieve<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.690> remove<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.560> bit

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to achieve you remove just a little bit

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.680 
to achieve you remove just a little bit
of<00:01:22.740> expression<00:01:23.370> on<00:01:23.580> an<00:01:23.700> eyebrow<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.510> have<00:01:24.660> a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
of expression on an eyebrow you have a

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.160 
of expression on an eyebrow you have a
very<00:01:24.930> different<00:01:25.170> result<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
very different result so for the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.320 
very different result so for the
combinations<00:01:28.740> we've<00:01:29.190> been<00:01:29.340> using<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.940> type<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
combinations we've been using a type of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.960 
combinations we've been using a type of
motion<00:01:31.140> capture<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> capture<00:01:32.670> at

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
motion capture but where you capture at

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.810 
motion capture but where you capture at
the<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.440> voice<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.950> actor<00:01:35.370> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the same time the voice of the actor the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
the same time the voice of the actor the
body<00:01:36.000> motion<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.200> facial<00:01:37.590> expression<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
body motion and the facial expression of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
body motion and the facial expression of
the<00:01:39.300> actor<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.980> that<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.280> our<00:01:41.430> approach<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the actor so that was our approach to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
the actor so that was our approach to
come<00:01:42.300> up<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.420> something<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.960> bit<00:01:43.050> different

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
come up with something a bit different

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.880 
come up with something a bit different
not<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.760> realistic<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.350> environment<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
not just realistic the environment is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240 
not just realistic the environment is
just<00:01:47.190> absolutely<00:01:47.400> kick<00:01:47.700> ass
