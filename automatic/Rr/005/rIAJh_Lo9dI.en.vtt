00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.890
 So 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.170
 the third exercise of our training 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.569
 exercise program for 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.999
 leg muscles 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.949
 we will do everything 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.019
 on a trolley which moves downhill 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.230
 plane 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.020
 first need 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.119
 set the back of this simulator under 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.269
 approximately 90 degrees 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.309
 inclined plane and make sure the cart 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.839
 securely fixed for 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.239
 so that she does not slip into the bank 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.810
 first option when 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.980
 stop sheet row high enough on 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 carts 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080
 in this case work 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.250
 posterior thigh muscle group 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.760
 or annual muscles 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.030
 Besides 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.130
 work is the top of the front group 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 my opinion 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.120
 with this exercise, you can 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 lift large enough weight 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.900
 the next option is when your feet stand 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.140
 low enough 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
 half court not accomplished carts 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.440
 with such a question 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 to train 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.430
 lower part of the front groups 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.220
 located directly on 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.990
 fabrics 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 however shipment savenkov became 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 significantly increased working i 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.800
 should be less 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 another embodiment of this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 exercises 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 when your feet are at an angle to each 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.970
 to a friend 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.870
 masks out 5 kilometers 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.890
 notice that the knees are in this 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 better move 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.290
 it gives you the opportunity to train 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 thigh muscle group 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.890
 and the most common error 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 plate 302 movement time pay 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 Attention 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.860
 that you can not tear tass 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.780
 at the bottom when the cells 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.520
 specialist it could cause injury 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.680
 spine 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.690
 so my 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.590
 I do not recommend that you support this 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 technology 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.500
 largely 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.009
 four of our exercises 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.929
 training day 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.709
 let's say dumbbell sitting 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.650
 he is called the wife clara skoda feature 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.469
 its that cooking is almost 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.299
 upright two women it distinguishes 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.229
 probably only the dumbbells themselves each other 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.329
 dexterous and daughters scr note that 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.079
 backside raised as high as possible 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.429
 almost vertically 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.779
 so that you can better 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.319
 consider the work of the muscles we are now 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 lower back 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.499
 front involved in this movement 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.499
 middle part of only prominent muscles 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.179
 he 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.659
 to 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.379
 breath just like in all the others 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.739
 exercise is essential 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.999
 strengthens the consideration of the Duma in 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.149
 In this case, we had a hand 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.559
 hand extension not garden most often 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.330
 there are two errors 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.070
 first when offices are located 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.920
 horizontally with this question come in 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.290
 below which results in treatment in work 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.859
 of business 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.949
 and the second mistake 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.059
 when elbows street forward in this case to 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.059
 work connected upper chest 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.199
 GDP 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.059
 and now I recall the correct version 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.339
 dumbbells whenever possible 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.229
 vertically 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.049
 at the lowest point touches the shoulder 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.649
 the top point almost touch each other 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.429
 follow your breath with your hands exhaling 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.629
 on the couch hand in debt 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.949
 f 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.949
 st 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.319
 as 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.269
 base movement for us that a battle that rise 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.749
 barbell man 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.709
 in this exercise stuffed can be raised 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.260
 maximum 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.369
 big weight 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.689
 need to take shoulder width 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.169
 top points 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.199
 hand position sit 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.199
 tightly pressed who else 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.299
 slight allowed 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.510
 forced to pay in front of the top 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.229
 movements 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.369
 this will allow the biceps to contract 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:15.919
 stronger 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.299
 most common 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.999
 mistakes 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.029
 latest news 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 Pavlenko rod 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.529
 or chitinka 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.379
 that is, helping other muscles in 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.080
 particular back muscles 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.849
 in both cases I can say 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.509
 biceps removed 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.270
 and for that it turns out 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.889
 wrong beautiful shape 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.819
 therefore, I recommend performing movements 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.930
 because 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.759
 do it before that is 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.969
 festival in itself boats pressed 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.689
 and the top of the elbow a little 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.279
 served in the period for a more complete 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.099
 pension cuts 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.819
 I remind you that without this defeat from 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.819
 big hands don't build 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.070
 recall 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.240
 So 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.889
 now we will train 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.759
 demanded Ilyich muscle or criticism 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.139
 Now that we are there 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.319
 many exercises 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.439
 one of them 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.409
 arm extension on a block device 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.769
 it is very important that the boats are pressed to 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:18.729
 torso at the lowest point of the sleeves and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.989
 was at the top of the maximum in 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.369
 debate to 3 thousand 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:23.849
 maximally diverged and 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.020
 shrunk 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.020
 note that tow trucks 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.689
 with this formulation of hands, everything is trained 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.749
 sentence 30 MSK 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:37.649
 peak wrong run when 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.919
 tricks are set aside from the body 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.289
 in this case, the muscles are involved. 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.289
 chest and load list remove 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.909
 once again the correct option 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.239
 in sport pressed down 

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:00.559
 is the top point 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.559
 maximum freedom 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.159
 if a 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.400
 the last harder than ours 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.050
 training day exercises for muscles 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.710
 abdominals 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.639
 we will do super series now 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.610
 eat in baku passed years in a row here in the gut 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.590
 first exercise our super series for 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.789
 abdominals then in this 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.849
 exercise work the upper part 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.330
 abdominals 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.689
 in order to properly perform 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.169
 this exercise is necessary trade and 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.680
 here speech and in tent federer run 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.939
 can break efficiency 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.380
 but in this case 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.980
 it will be very difficult to do this 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 so we suggest you do the exercises 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.629
 sprint individual exhale when lowering 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.149
 inhale 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:51.499
 need to do as much as possible 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.179
 possible number of repetitions usually 

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.179
 it's usually 20 25 repeat 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.489
 the second exercise of our super series 

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:05.289
 exercises for the lower abdomen volume 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.289
 stone this button of the descent of the world 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.439
 I want to draw your attention to many 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.229
 soms rise if you raise them 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.229
 straight legs you will lose balance 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.109
 Of course, repeating as much as possible 

00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:23.109
 possible mechanism arbitrary 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.789
 basic workouts 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.180
 aims to increase muscle strength 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.659
 increase in muscle volume 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.110
 reduce them 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.189
 percent fat content 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:39.639
 if you want to increase strength but 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.449
 must perform 5 six reps 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:45.449
 in two three approaches of each exercise 

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:46.990
 if a 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.929
 you need tire volumes 

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:52.489
 we have to do 80 reps in each 

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:55.489
 exercises are also two three approaches 

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.279
 if your job is less fatty 

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.479
 interlayer 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.039
 perform at least 12 15 reps for 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.900
 upper body and at least fifteen 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.039
 twenty repetitions for legs 

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:10.529
 also in two three approaches 

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:12.419
 with cancer case rest time should be 

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:14.490
 reduced to 40 a forty five seconds
