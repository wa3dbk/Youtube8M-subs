00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a little bit and maybe about right here

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940 
a little bit and maybe about right here

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.980 
that space in the trunk is fantastic
actually<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.250> doesn't<00:02:19.460> look<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.760> much<00:02:20.120> if

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
actually it doesn't look like much if

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.830 
actually it doesn't look like much if
you've<00:02:21.170> got<00:02:21.320> these<00:02:21.470> door<00:02:21.710> pockets<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.690> can

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you've got these door pockets you can

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.260 
you've got these door pockets you can
take<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.520> optional<00:02:25.940> trunk

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
take this out this is the optional trunk

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.980 
take this out this is the optional trunk
liner<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.790> lifts<00:02:29.180> up<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.840> you

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
liner and then this lifts up and you

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.370 
liner and then this lifts up and you
have<00:02:30.080> even<00:02:30.200> more<00:02:30.440> storage<00:02:30.680> under<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
have even more storage under here and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.890 
have even more storage under here and
this<00:02:33.380> will<00:02:33.560> actually<00:02:33.770> fold<00:02:34.580> back<00:02:34.850> or<00:02:35.450> come<00:02:35.720> out

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
this will actually fold back or come out

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.560 
this will actually fold back or come out
and<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:37.220> kind<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.460> dips<00:02:37.670> down<00:02:37.910> which<00:02:38.270> gives<00:02:38.510> you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
and it kind of dips down which gives you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.060 
and it kind of dips down which gives you
even<00:02:38.720> more<00:02:38.990> storage<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.560> if<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:39.800> still

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
even more storage and if that's still

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.900 
even more storage and if that's still
not<00:02:40.190> enough<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:41.300> also<00:02:41.570> comes<00:02:41.960> out<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.790> you've

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
not enough this also comes out so you've

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.230 
not enough this also comes out so you've
got<00:02:44.120> about<00:02:44.600> three<00:02:45.470> layers<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.800> storage<00:02:46.240> also

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
