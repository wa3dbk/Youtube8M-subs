00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.190
 hello how welcome are you to the first 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.440
 art tutorial in every way 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.480
 blogspot dot mx this is the first 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.220
 video but little by little I will go up more 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.140
 so I hope you enjoy it and we start 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.300
 in this first tutorial I'm going to 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.110
 show how to recover a hard drive that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.900
 step from the ntfs format to the raw format the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.600
 ntfs format is a file system 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.840
 which is mainly occupied in windows a 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.190
 from the windows version nt its 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.680
 main characteristic is that of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.080
 provide more space the partitions with 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.580
 the hard drives unlike the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.369
 other formats such as the 412 fat 16 and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.610
 fat 32 that although it is old technology 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.170
 still a clear example remains 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.540
 for those who are not familiar with 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.420
 these terms in which I also 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 I include is the following and that to me 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.930
 it happened 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.360
 before there were only memories today 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 it would make a lot of laugh to see but really 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.930
 they existed and in their times they were very 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.000
 faces 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 in my case I was in memories and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.850
 I still have them of 4 8 16 32 64 128 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 256 and 512 megas also the versions of 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:19.540
 12 48 16 and the latest acquired 32 gb 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.590
 the fact is that from 4 megabytes to 4 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.960
 gigas 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.690
 I never had any problem but starting 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.570
 of the 8 gig version was that I knew 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.720
 that was the ntfs format since the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.510
 memories came with the format fat32 and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.280
 they would not let me put more than 4 gigs I thought 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.100
 that the memory is damaged but the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.940
 I tried several times and all good only 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.230
 failed when I put a dvd in the usb 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 so when I researched I knew that for 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.280
 use all the memory capacity 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.690
 had to pass it to the file system 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.630
 ntfs and everything is solved in the case of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.450
 raw format that I researched and that does not 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.880
 find a clear definition you can 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.710
 define as new or virgin since the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.780
 raúl's translation is raw 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.680
 and in the computer world this 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.629
 term is more concerned with photography 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.980
 for those who have entered looking for something 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.250
 related to wrestling 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.409
 North American I ask for an apology now 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.920
 that has nothing to do with road of the 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.510
 ww and good enough information and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.780
 let's see how this is presented 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.030
 problem in a PC will not happen to everyone 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.620
 the same as me but it can serve them 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.510
 to feed on that can be 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.590
 happening or what can they do to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.590
 solve your problem 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.710
 let's start team 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.210
 suppose we try to open a 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.510
 file either music video photo or such 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.860
 once a common microsoft office file 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.870
 excel word 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.040
 we double click on the unit where 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.040
 find our file 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.210
 once again 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.340
 As you can see, the following appears 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.530
 error 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 and in the memory it tells us why 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.340
 we can not enter our unit 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.340
 where is our file the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.950
 which says the following location not 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.030
 available 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.280
 can not get access to the file 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.280
 or directory that is damaged or is 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.870
 unreadable this kind of messages always 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.970
 they surprise us 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.500
 so I thought it could be and I went to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.500
 properties to check the unit 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.810
 as you can see the unit does not present 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.729
 no information 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.069
 and then I present them 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.180
 a box of what unity is today 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.529
 in day 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.529
 again the operation 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.120
 you can see the differences 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.120
 they are very remarkable 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.539
 another thing that is usually done in these 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.129
 cases is to format the unit but only 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.710
 It is done when the files contained 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.710
 in the unit are no longer necessary 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.019
 The next thing that occurred to me was to go to 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.369
 disk manager to see what 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.369
 information had collected 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.789
 and it was where I realized after 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.590
 observe a few seconds that the system 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.770
 my unit was no longer the same and that there was 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.879
 suffered a radical change 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.879
 being the unit 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.250
 with the ntfs file system 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.700
 it happened to be a format 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.120
 of type round 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.470
 that as I commented the raw format 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.800
 it's been a virgin or new state 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.030
 therefore it has no file 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.640
 but as the unit had already been 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.660
 used in this case under the system 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.660
 operative windows 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.740
 we can see that if he has files 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.760
 and therefore it has already been used 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.470
 why this happens 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.650
 Well, the truth is many reasons 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.630
 some of us realize in others 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.020
 occasions and we notice 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.600
 in my case try to develop a 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.610
 computer and put together another one with all my 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.850
 components that I have of several 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.850
 computers 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.310
 but do not wait for the ipc to shut down 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.310
 totally 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.669
 and remove the power cord 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.460
 hard drive and this was what caused the 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:11.389
 what he did was lose the system 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.310
 of ntfs files that is the one that reads 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.770
 windows to access any 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.949
 type of file that the disk has 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.400
 by not finding that file because it's like 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:25.550
 if you take into account that it is new 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.169
 and that's what happened already having the 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.389
 necessary data what you have to 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.310
 do next is to say with the 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:34.550
 Mr. vigo and ask him for all the help 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.500
 necessary which I already have in my possession and 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.840
 now we just need to check which of all the 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.430
 information is true since everything 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.430
 that is on the internet not always 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.410
 it's a good solution since they have a 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.330
 idea of ​​what happened now we pass to the 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.410
 next stage that is recovery 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.410
 of the archives
