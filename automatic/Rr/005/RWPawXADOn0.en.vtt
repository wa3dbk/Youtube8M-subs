00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.399

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 for example if I am with my the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 garbage in the trash is not open here I'm with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.680

 UOL did not know what you have I do not 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.290
 I would have xbmc right or wanted and I wanted 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.860
 update and if I enter who 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 file manager I'll mount and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.009
 It's your fault, there's no way, you'll see. 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.950
 that in Brazil and you'll have the folder 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.990
 pps if you do not have a click with 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.810
 gold and new point camera the rm 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.750
 belletti and bass and let e mail thousand 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.180
 folders over is to calculate space 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.170
 used one thousand folders and create one 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 folder with a dwarf week usp to pps 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.760

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.709
 here are some programs and xbmc but 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.530
 I 'm just teaching that you have to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.540
 have the folder because because in that folder 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.870
 pps where the xbox applications will exit 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.000
 certain beauty ended as a child passes 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.880
 okay the ft says that the easiest way 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.550
 you do what you copy to access 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.739
 and safer is also in the way 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 more secure than who are you doing ftp 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.959
