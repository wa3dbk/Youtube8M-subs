00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.990
 in the morning a fire was declared in 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.329

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.249
 atrocious that has caused one of the worst 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.659
 catastrophes that are remembered in towns 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.879
 a fire that has been carried by 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.740
 in front of dreams and hopes of 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.480
 thousands of families and thousands of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.580
 workers that today 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.890
 they feel uncertain about their future 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.900
 campofrío is a symbol of villages and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.460
 Castile and Leon 'but also be 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.200
 treats a flagship industry 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.060
 Spanish agri-food industry a sector that 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.829
 has always been a leader and today is 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.809
 vital for economic recovery and 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.489
 of employment we are talking about more than 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.920
 1000 direct jobs, as many 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.109
 indirect and thousands of others in the sector 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.659
 primary suppliers also of all 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.159
 they have to worry and deal with 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.079
 that today in the plenary session of the congress of the 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.300
 deputies I want to show all the support 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.159
 from the socialist parliamentary group to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.469
 campofrío and all its workers and 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.050
 workers all those families deserve 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.550
 know that they have unanimous support 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.499
 institutional politician in boroughs in 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.749
 Castilla y León and in Spain to achieve 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.699
 that the cold field is rebuilt 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.430
 recover all the production and all the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.840
 employment in villages there are measures in 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.149
 of industrial policy of 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.740
 of tax incentives that the 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.990
 Government of Spain in collaboration with 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 the board of Castilla y León can and should 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.609
 undertake for that reason I ask you minister 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.289
 that is sensitive to cooperate with the 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.119
 local and regional administrations 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.890
 to listen to those responsible for the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.409
 company and the representatives of the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.880
 workers I want to recognize the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.060
 responsibility with which they have acted 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.679
 the company and the institutions but it's 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.090
 important that today here and in 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.439
 representation of the government of Spain 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.569
 make an explicit statement of 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.789
 support for workers and measures 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.920
 that are necessary to resurrect the 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.200
 campofrío factory in villages and that the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.509
 days without work without a place to go 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 work are the least possible 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.829
 I'm sure that campofrio has 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.360
 future I grew up precisely in the 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.310
 street sonsoles valve that had that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.319
 name in memory of the daughter of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.360
 founder of this company because just 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.950
 in front of my house portal was the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.899
 Main door of the factory the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.189
 old factory of campofrío each 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.420
 early morning at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.119
 neighbors of the neighborhood we listened to the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.129
 siren of that shift change 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.690
 factory nothing remains was demolished to 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.340
 move to more facilities 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.560
 more competitive and larger modern 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 So I am convinced that also 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.459
 this time and thanks to the responsibility 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.340
 of the company and political support 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.349
 unanimous of all campofrío will resurface of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.060
 pronouncement the minister minister
