00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
but you know what I mean so this is a

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.229 
but you know what I mean so this is a
tamarillo<00:00:55.549> they<00:00:55.879> come<00:00:56.150> in<00:00:56.839> red<00:00:57.769> or<00:00:58.070> in<00:00:58.430> gold<00:00:58.909> or

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.770 
yellow I guess and the yellow ones are
supposed<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.530> be<00:01:03.710> less<00:01:04.010> acidic<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.760> sweet<00:01:05.449> or

so<00:05:19.820> how<00:05:20.330> interesting<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:23.230> yep<00:05:26.440> very

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
so how interesting is that yep very

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.640 
so how interesting is that yep very
unique<00:05:27.770> or<00:05:28.070> unique<00:05:28.370> anyways<00:05:28.940> um<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.470> think

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
unique or unique anyways um so I think

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.620 
unique or unique anyways um so I think
that<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.700> doesn't<00:05:31.970> need<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.210> be<00:05:32.300> eaten<00:05:32.600> with

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
that it doesn't need to be eaten with

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.870 
that it doesn't need to be eaten with
sugar<00:05:32.990> necessarily<00:05:33.740> although<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.580> think<00:05:34.820> a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
sugar necessarily although I think a

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.870 
sugar necessarily although I think a
little<00:05:35.120> sugar<00:05:35.300> might<00:05:35.630> help<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.930> little<00:05:35.960> bit<00:05:36.290> and

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
little sugar might help a little bit and

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.030 
little sugar might help a little bit and
and<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.180> may<00:05:38.450> be<00:05:38.510> an<00:05:38.750> acquired<00:05:39.080> taste<00:05:39.290> for<00:05:39.830> some

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
and it may be an acquired taste for some

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040 
and it may be an acquired taste for some
people<00:05:40.370> but<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.640> think<00:05:40.970> in<00:05:41.120> general<00:05:41.150> every<00:05:41.870> once

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
people but I think in general every once

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.330 
people but I think in general every once
in<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.200> while<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.710> would<00:05:42.800> make<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.040> really

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
in a while it would make a really

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.000 
in a while it would make a really
interesting<00:05:43.850> fruit<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.480> eat<00:05:44.510> itself<00:05:45.010> anyways

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
interesting fruit to eat itself anyways

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.440 
interesting fruit to eat itself anyways
