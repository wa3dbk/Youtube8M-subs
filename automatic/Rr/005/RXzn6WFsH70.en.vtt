00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 as roofing corrugated board 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 use both wall and bearing 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.680
 profiled sheet profiled for 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 the roofs of small buildings are usually 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 from 18 out of 20 and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 with 21 small roofs do not experience 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.470
 heavy loads 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.080
 so the strength of wall sheeting 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 enough more roof area and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 the greater the distance between the rafters 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 the higher the load on the roof of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.380
 sheeting for large buildings needed 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 profiled carrier ns35 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.440
 and n60 to increase sheet strength 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 metals on it make extra 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 ribs reinforcing this main 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.809
 hallmark of the carrying professional sheet 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.910
 marked such a profiled letter n 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 Roofs from corrugated board as well as roofs from 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.149
 metal tiles 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 one of the easiest is different 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.770
 corrugated and in metal tiles 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.049
 just profile and look right 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 flooring is not heavy material on the roof he 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.500
 will not overload rafters with him 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.490
 the ability to do roofing 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 the design is lighter and cheaper before 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.689
 how to proceed with the installation of corrugated 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 must first be laid on 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.310
 rafters waterproofing material a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.549
 then proceed to the construction of crates 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.590
 and counter sheathing between insulation and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 roofing sheets need 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.619
 leave a ventilated air gap 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.729
 not less than four centimeters high 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 if you decide to cover the roof 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.590
 professional flooring when choosing give 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 the preference for sheets whose length is not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.579
 less than the length of the roof slope 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.659
 then when installing the roof will be less 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.060
 transverse joints 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.490
 which greatly enhances hydra protective 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.079
 roofing properties and simplifies 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 installation 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.860
 if the roof slope has very large 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.170
 options 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.230
 installation of corrugated board is performed par 1 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.300
 starting from the bottom of the livestock profile 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.060
 smooth coating stack does not overlap 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.340
 less than eight centimeters for mounting 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.860
 sheeting ok sheathing use 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.020
 self-tapping screws that fasten 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.390
 without pre -hole preparation 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.860
 Hexagon can also be used. 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.600
 screws and liner in the form of plastic washers 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.880
 basic rules for mounting a stella profile 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 sheeting is mounted in places 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.830
 fit the lower parts of the wave 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
 the sheathing of the roof of the building during installation 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.970
 sheets of profiled flooring and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.590
 extreme slat crates sheets 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.840
 must be attached in each 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.300
 deepening whereas in intermediate 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.330
 locations permissible mount through one 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.489
 recess mount in longitudinal seams 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.970
 should be performed at a distance of no more 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.480
 5 centimeters categorically unacceptable 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.620
 fastening sheets of corrugated nails 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.440
 use is also unacceptable 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.780
 electric welding or gas cutting also 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.930
 it is forbidden to perform in a similar way 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.250
 hole in profiled sheets 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 fastening screws produce at 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 assistance drill or screwdriver with a small
