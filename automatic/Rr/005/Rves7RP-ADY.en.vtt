but I feel like this charcoal gray is
false<00:03:47.190> neutral<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.110> next<00:03:49.410> one<00:03:49.590> is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890

it's almost the deepest burgundy with a
little<00:03:54.750> bit<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.900> brown<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.920> reason

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
little bit of brown in it but the reason

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.040 
little bit of brown in it but the reason
that<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.580> one's<00:03:56.790> included<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.480> because<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
that this one's included is because the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.680 
that this one's included is because the
color<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.350> named<00:03:58.709> wicked<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.300> cool

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
color is named wicked that is so cool

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.720 
color is named wicked that is so cool
for<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.050> time<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.320> year<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.250> month<00:04:02.610> of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
for this time of year for the month of

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.000 
for this time of year for the month of
October<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.480> being<00:04:03.630> Halloween<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.440> just

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
October and it being Halloween I just

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.680 
October and it being Halloween I just
think<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.820> included<00:04:06.300> mostly

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
think that this one was included mostly

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.170 
think that this one was included mostly
because<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:08.100> name<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.670> also<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
because of the name but also it's a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.059 
because of the name but also it's a
beautiful<00:04:09.540> color<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.110> last<00:04:10.350> one<00:04:10.740> is

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
beautiful color and then the last one is

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.940 
beautiful color and then the last one is
this<00:04:11.370> Essie<00:04:11.850> color<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.420> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
this Essie color in the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.490 
this Essie color in the
Kyler's<00:04:13.099> nothing<00:04:13.550> else<00:04:13.760> metals<00:04:14.420> now<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:15.260> one

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
Kyler's nothing else metals now this one

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.229 
Kyler's nothing else metals now this one
is<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.010> different<00:04:16.040> than<00:04:16.549> every<00:04:16.880> other<00:04:16.910> one

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
is so different than every other one

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.150 
is so different than every other one
that<00:04:17.329> I've<00:04:17.480> shown<00:04:17.720> in<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:17.989> video<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.829> one

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
that I've shown in this video this one

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.909 
that I've shown in this video this one
really<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.519> just<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:20.000> metallic<00:04:20.720> soft<00:04:21.169> gray<00:04:21.620> I

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
really is just a metallic soft gray I

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.860 
really is just a metallic soft gray I
wouldn't<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.639> necessarily<00:04:22.850> see<00:04:23.720> this

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
wouldn't really necessarily see this

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.080 
wouldn't really necessarily see this
color<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.350> think<00:04:24.590> fall<00:04:24.919> but<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.790> just<00:04:25.940> thought

not<00:04:40.340> dupes<00:04:40.639> for<00:04:40.880> each<00:04:40.970> other<00:04:41.150> at<00:04:41.330> all<00:04:41.479> but

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
not dupes for each other at all but

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.050 
not dupes for each other at all but
they're<00:04:42.200> really<00:04:42.740> really<00:04:42.919> similar<00:04:43.430> colors<00:04:43.880> so

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
they're really really similar colors so

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.400 
they're really really similar colors so
I<00:04:44.090> thought<00:04:44.360> that<00:04:44.510> was<00:04:44.600> kind<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.870> interesting

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
I thought that was kind of interesting

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.680 
I thought that was kind of interesting
that<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:45.560> just<00:04:46.100> picked<00:04:46.430> up<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.700> color<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.630> I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
that I just picked up a color and then I

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.659 
that I just picked up a color and then I
turn<00:04:47.900> around<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.350> get<00:04:48.470> sent<00:04:48.860> almost<00:04:49.310> an

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
turn around and get sent almost an

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.600 
turn around and get sent almost an
identical<00:04:49.790> color<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.540> my<00:04:50.630> Birchbox<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.830> maybe

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
identical color in my Birchbox so maybe

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.129 
identical color in my Birchbox so maybe
it<00:04:52.850> is<00:04:53.000> more<00:04:53.210> fall<00:04:53.540> than<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.900> had<00:04:54.050> originally

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
it is more fall than I had originally

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.570 
it is more fall than I had originally
thought<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.280> those<00:04:55.490> are<00:04:55.669> my<00:04:55.790> 10<00:04:56.120> top<00:04:57.050> 10<00:04:57.080> /<00:04:57.889> the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
thought so those are my 10 top 10 / the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.780 
thought so those are my 10 top 10 / the
bonus<00:04:58.910> color<00:04:59.180> from<00:04:59.450> Birchbox<00:04:59.680> colors<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.979> the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
bonus color from Birchbox colors of the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.219
