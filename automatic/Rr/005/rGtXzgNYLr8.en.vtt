eventually I realized his bubbled I pie

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
eventually I realized his bubbled I pie
pops<00:01:36.570> wreck<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.990> point<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.950> break<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pops wreck at that point so I break the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.300 
pops wreck at that point so I break the
bubble<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.880> gets<00:01:39.030> away<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.600> fine

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
bubble he gets away which is fine

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.530 
bubble he gets away which is fine
because<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.790> fury<00:01:42.000> war<00:01:42.150> hasn't<00:01:42.360> done

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
because that fury war hasn't done

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
because that fury war hasn't done
anything<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.200> paladin<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.939> I

setting<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.670> would<00:02:38.269> be<00:02:38.300> too<00:02:38.480> worried<00:02:38.720> about

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
setting so I would be too worried about

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.960 
setting so I would be too worried about
it<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:39.860> guy<00:02:39.980> pops<00:02:40.190> or<00:02:40.400> mastery<00:02:40.819> he's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
it so this guy pops or mastery he's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.430 
it so this guy pops or mastery he's
popping<00:02:41.360> cooldowns<00:02:41.720> trying<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.050> stay<00:02:42.230> alive

popping cooldowns trying to stay alive

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.470 
popping cooldowns trying to stay alive
so<00:02:43.100> he<00:02:43.130> gets<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> couple<00:02:43.489> free<00:02:43.730> cast<00:02:43.940> off<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.330> get

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
so he gets a couple free cast off I get

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.170 
so he gets a couple free cast off I get
a<00:02:44.510> intercepts<00:02:45.319> done<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.549> as<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.910> see

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
a intercepts done but as you can see

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.539 
a intercepts done but as you can see
