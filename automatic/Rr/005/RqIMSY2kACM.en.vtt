00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.770
 two 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.750
 here in a preview if you already have to 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.210
 is very high of the preview that I do in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 my channel but only some preview 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 because I know they last a long time without recording 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 video and then I recorded preview is comfortable 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 but I do it so they know that it's 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 doing something in all of that comes first 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 what have we called how are we going to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 like the game that there are for devices 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 as much as ios as android and well 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 The first thing you will notice is a black thing 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is below the hearts that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 would be the score that you will know 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 later it only saves the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.300
 resources to the deaths that you the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.880
 deaths that you been whatever and what 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 the deaths of you to the amount of 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.720
 deaths that you have had and all that and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 well, this can be moved as 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.310
 can see if it moves but that's not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.000
 important how important we gave 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 will try in addition and well here I have a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 AK-47 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.560
 this is the ak-47 to greet her and then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.090
 well now we have 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 we need water cartridges whatever 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.560
 we need 63 and as you can notice 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.700
 or whatever it will not be here now the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.230
 sound that makes very 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.230
 let say 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:41.730
 tokyo let's say it's very 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.430
 I do not know very well so let's shoot 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.770
 although you will notice that it sounds super good that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 offer me many additions by adding 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 I do not know, I'm not going to say how many 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.840
 think add because I'm basing the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 how is this way so we're going to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 continue with the next one as you can see 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.110
 the wii the wii is very towards the style 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 thing and this is the bar that will be a guy 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 of rifle so let's go with 63 like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.820
 you can see two buttons will appear but 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.390
 first with this as you can see a 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.900
 button 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.260
 but that button or whatever it may be 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.270
 move it if you can move it why because 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.610
 it will be like a putt that we can move around 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.590
 wherever and also we can 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 move to this neighborhood and with how can 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 see can move it all that can 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.640
 avoid it as you want because 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.850
 Somebody speaks to me they told me that they 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.860
 the uncomfortable woman this where she was like that 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.560
 that we can see it only that if 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 we can see all that so etc are from 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.740
 things that only serves in places to see 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.459
 let's put ourselves in this building you 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.459
 I have created 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.470
 We are going here and as you can see I passed 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.240
 very well I think so and also maps well 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.590
 but that will be after it is open and 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.960
 based on my encouragement , I need many 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.810
 things to add so let's see 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.540
 who can we plant we have one and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.940
 ready you see me better besides for example 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.010
 that this one that would be the barret this baby 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.070
 one that will have an editable zoom 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.460
 that you can move it away and put it 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.160
 medium so on, then the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.410
 sounds are very what you can see are very 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.220
 good if I have it I have four just 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.880
 and they know they will not know how hard is the mp4 if 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.370
 when cartridges are put here 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.610
 m4 know the most pro wing of all 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.700
 is the most pro so let's see no 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.970
 could six be so that but can that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.849
 this has a ship we can follow this 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.239
 and they can put on and this is entered this 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.790
 rag but you can do this test as 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.140
 a book but well before I wrote 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.140
 to these are the sounds 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.480
 it recharges and you can meet again 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.900
 and well, this is the preview yet 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.239
 I know it affects many things but 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 then they will not know what will last for 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.849
 to be able to follow that and to be able to 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.229
 this would move the hill like that 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.109
 as of whatever power can 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.570
 serve you hood or buttons and put it 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.120
 where you want maybe I need to put on 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.280
 run and crouch but only all of that 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.990
 I will put forward and I will not do so much 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.240
 own or whatever if this stops 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.860
 tell you I hope you liked luck 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.940
 Write it down so it is commented until the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.180
 next 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 bye
