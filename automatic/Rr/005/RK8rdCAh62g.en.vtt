box I think is probably about 14 inches
long<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> cut<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> 12<00:02:08.520> by<00:02:08.879> 12<00:02:10.250> piece<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.520> paper

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
long so I cut a 12 by 12 piece of paper

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.520 
long so I cut a 12 by 12 piece of paper
just<00:02:12.330> roughly<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> half

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
just roughly in half

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.010 
just roughly in half
measuring<00:02:14.100> anything<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.630> what<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.900> going

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
measuring anything and so what I'm going

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500 
measuring anything and so what I'm going
to<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:17.370> their<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.880> edges<00:02:18.300> there

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to do is see their little edges there

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030 
to do is see their little edges there
that<00:02:18.750> stick<00:02:19.020> out<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> put

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that stick out so I'm just going to put

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.430 
that stick out so I'm just going to put
that<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> center<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.020> cut

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that in the center and then I cut

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.640 
that in the center and then I cut
another<00:02:22.920> piece<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.750> there's<00:02:25.410> no

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
another piece like that and there's no

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.110 
another piece like that and there's no
measuring<00:02:26.100> here<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.580> don't<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.850> make<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
measuring here we don't to make this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.600 
measuring here we don't to make this
hard<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.930> supposed<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:28.530> easy<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.160> I'm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
hard it's supposed to be easy so I'm

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.420 
hard it's supposed to be easy so I'm
going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.790> apply<00:02:30.110> acrylic<00:02:31.110> gel<00:02:31.440> medium<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
going to apply acrylic gel medium to the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
going to apply acrylic gel medium to the
bottom<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.420> cover<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.989> sides<00:02:34.290> like

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
bottom and just cover the sides like

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.910 
bottom and just cover the sides like
that<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.069> both<00:02:35.310> sides<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.060> glue<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:37.020> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that on both sides and glue it down so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.790 
that on both sides and glue it down so
I've<00:02:38.280> got<00:02:38.520> both<00:02:38.760> sides<00:02:39.120> covered<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:40.410> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
I've got both sides covered here so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.710 
I've got both sides covered here so
other<00:02:41.130> reason<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.520> do<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> sides<00:02:42.030> first<00:02:42.390> is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
other reason I do the sides first is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930 
other reason I do the sides first is
because<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.290> XS<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.920> overlap<00:02:44.430> onto<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
because the XS can overlap onto the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
because the XS can overlap onto the
front<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:45.660> I'll<00:02:45.780> cover<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
front and then I'll cover it with a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340 
front and then I'll cover it with a
piece<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.769> paper<00:02:47.070> now<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.360> next<00:02:48.630> step<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.200> only

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
piece of paper now this next step I only

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.160 
piece of paper now this next step I only
do<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.610> want<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.000> keep<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.660> bag<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
do this if I want to keep the bag and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.960 
do this if I want to keep the bag and
store<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:52.739> later<00:02:52.769> because<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.489> don't<00:02:53.730> have

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
store it for later because I don't have

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.050 
store it for later because I don't have
enough<00:02:54.720> space<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.739> whole<00:02:56.070> bunch<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.489> cereal

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
enough space for a whole bunch of cereal

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.699 
enough space for a whole bunch of cereal
open<00:02:57.600> boxes<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.370> take<00:02:59.670> my<00:03:00.230> score<00:03:01.230> tool

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
open boxes so I just take my score tool

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.910 
open boxes so I just take my score tool
and<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.670> kind<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.030> push<00:03:03.720> down<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and just kind of push down into the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.030 
and just kind of push down into the
cardboard<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.150> way<00:03:06.300> down<00:03:06.569> in<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
cardboard all the way down in there and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.300 
cardboard all the way down in there and
then<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:09.019> squish<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.050> close<00:03:10.470> make<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.130> ends

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
then just squish it close make the ends

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.390 
then just squish it close make the ends
meet<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.660> then<00:03:13.410> all<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.890> way<00:03:14.040> down<00:03:14.250> on

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
meet here and then all the way down on

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.280 
meet here and then all the way down on
both<00:03:14.580> sides<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:15.269> with<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> bottom<00:03:16.080> like

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
both sides and then with the bottom like

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
both sides and then with the bottom like
that<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.459> store<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.079> would<00:03:25.380> store

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that it will store like you would store

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.259 
that it will store like you would store
now<00:03:27.780> we're<00:03:27.959> gonna<00:03:28.079> go<00:03:28.260> out<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.470> cover<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
now we're gonna go out to cover the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.560 
now we're gonna go out to cover the
sides<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.019> bottom<00:03:32.060> okay<00:03:33.060> I've<00:03:33.180> had<00:03:33.329> so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
sides and the bottom okay I've had so

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.610 
sides and the bottom okay I've had so
much<00:03:33.690> fun<00:03:34.019> covering<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.130> box<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> at<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.380> top

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
much fun covering this box so at the top

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.380 
much fun covering this box so at the top
you<00:03:37.799> can<00:03:37.829> see<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:38.820> still<00:03:39.000> kind<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.239> wet

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you can see here it's still kind of wet

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.800 
you can see here it's still kind of wet
but<00:03:39.660> I've<00:03:39.810> used<00:03:40.230> scallop<00:03:41.010> circles<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.540> just

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
but I've used scallop circles and I just

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.720 
but I've used scallop circles and I just
punched<00:03:43.140> out<00:03:43.290> six<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.980> turned<00:03:44.430> them<00:03:44.609> around

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
punched out six and turned them around

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.670 
punched out six and turned them around
just<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.480> kind<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.690> give<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.019> scalloped<00:03:46.470> edge

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just to kind of give it a scalloped edge

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.470 
just to kind of give it a scalloped edge
so<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.459> side<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:48.090> solid<00:03:52.640> straight<00:03:53.640> so

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
so on this side it's solid straight so

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.810 
so on this side it's solid straight so
I'm<00:03:54.780> gonna<00:03:54.989> go<00:03:55.230> ahead<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.590> make<00:03:56.070> some<00:03:56.100> handles

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
I'm gonna go ahead and make some handles

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.729 
I'm gonna go ahead and make some handles
for<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.239> box<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.109> originally<00:03:58.410> gonna

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
for this box and I was originally gonna

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.890 
for this box and I was originally gonna
just<00:03:59.070> braid<00:03:59.340> some<00:03:59.640> yarn<00:03:59.880> scraps<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.450> had<00:04:00.660> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
just braid some yarn scraps I had and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.660 
just braid some yarn scraps I had and
then<00:04:01.019> when<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.620> went<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.920> look<00:04:02.160> at<00:04:02.280> my<00:04:02.430> yarn

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
then when I went to look at my yarn

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.240 
then when I went to look at my yarn
stash<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.359> had<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:03.750> cool<00:04:04.079> stuff<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.799> don't<00:04:05.010> even

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
stash I had this cool stuff I don't even

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.270 
stash I had this cool stuff I don't even
know<00:04:05.430> what<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.480> it'll<00:04:07.260> make<00:04:07.530> perfect

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
know what it is and it'll make perfect

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.069 
know what it is and it'll make perfect
handles<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.030> I'm<00:04:09.120> gonna<00:04:09.299> punch<00:04:09.630> two<00:04:10.049> holes

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
handles so I'm gonna punch two holes

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.460 
handles so I'm gonna punch two holes
here<00:04:10.739> with<00:04:10.920> my<00:04:11.070> crop-a-dile<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.060> then<00:04:12.989> knot

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
here with my crop-a-dile and then knot

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.699 
here with my crop-a-dile and then knot
this<00:04:13.739> through<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.459> make<00:04:14.609> some<00:04:14.790> handles<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.650> I

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
this through and make some handles so I

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.670 
this through and make some handles so I
cut<00:04:17.160> two<00:04:17.430> pieces<00:04:17.459> exactly<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.810> same<00:04:19.169> point

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
cut two pieces exactly the same point

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.420 
cut two pieces exactly the same point
and<00:04:20.220> then<00:04:21.120> what<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.510> did<00:04:21.659> is<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.620> used<00:04:22.860> my<00:04:23.070> big

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
and then what I did is I used my big

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.590 
and then what I did is I used my big
chop

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
chop

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.870 
chop
I<00:04:24.660> went<00:04:25.530> kind<00:04:25.890> of<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.040> little<00:04:26.250> bit<00:04:26.370> lower<00:04:26.580> than

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
I went kind of a little bit lower than

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880 
I went kind of a little bit lower than
the<00:04:27.000> scalloped<00:04:27.450> edge<00:04:27.600> there<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.260> want<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.830> make

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
the scalloped edge there I want to make

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.400 
the scalloped edge there I want to make
sure<00:04:29.010> it's<00:04:29.310> pretty<00:04:29.520> strong<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.930> went<00:04:31.260> from

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
sure it's pretty strong so I went from

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.220 
sure it's pretty strong so I went from
the<00:04:31.590> outside<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.490> as<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.060> can<00:04:33.300> see<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.960> this

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
the outside in as you can see on this

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.890 
the outside in as you can see on this
side<00:04:34.530> here<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.790> tied<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.150> really<00:04:36.600> tight

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
side here and I tied a really tight

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.520 
side here and I tied a really tight
double<00:04:37.200> knot<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.890> then<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.880> will<00:04:39.060> trim<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.540> when

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
double knot and then I will trim it when

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.000 
double knot and then I will trim it when
I'm<00:04:40.620> done

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
I'm done

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.940 
I'm done

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
so I also went on to cut some scalloped

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.290 
so I also went on to cut some scalloped
circles<00:04:44.400> I'll<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.700> punch<00:04:44.940> them<00:04:45.120> with<00:04:45.270> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
circles I'll just punch them with a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.360 
circles I'll just punch them with a
stamp<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.900> punch<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.410> put<00:04:46.590> them<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
stamp and a punch and put them on the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.480 
stamp and a punch and put them on the
front<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.150> box<00:04:48.690> there<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.680> then<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.310> took

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
front of the box there and then I took

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.540 
front of the box there and then I took
the<00:04:50.850> top<00:04:51.060> note<00:04:51.420> shape<00:04:51.810> from<00:04:52.020> Stampin<00:04:52.620> Up<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.040> ran

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
it through the dots it's like it's not a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.450 
it through the dots it's like it's not a
cuttlebug<00:05:00.530> embossing<00:05:01.530> folder<00:05:01.950> it's<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.190> staff
