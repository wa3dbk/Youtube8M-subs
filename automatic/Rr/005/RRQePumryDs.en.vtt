00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
all these little bristles which are not

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.400 
all these little bristles which are not
like<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> normal<00:00:27.480> mascara<00:00:27.779> brush<00:00:27.990> they're<00:00:28.199> like

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
like a normal mascara brush they're like

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
like a normal mascara brush they're like
the<00:00:29.660> foamy<00:00:30.660> kind<00:00:31.399> they're<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.520> silicone<00:00:33.059> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the foamy kind they're like silicone so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
the foamy kind they're like silicone so
usually<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.890> after<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.370> pull<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
usually what I do after I pull out the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.990 
usually what I do after I pull out the
brush<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.420> wipe<00:00:37.260> off<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> tip<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
brush is wipe off the tip because it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
brush is wipe off the tip because it
always<00:00:39.149> has<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.480> too<00:00:39.660> much<00:00:39.840> mascara<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
always has like too much mascara on it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.299 
always has like too much mascara on it
so<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> tip<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> looks<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.309> be

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so the tip of it looks like this be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.360 
so the tip of it looks like this be
similar<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.100> telescopic<00:00:47.100> mascara

over your eyelashes too much and it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.200 
over your eyelashes too much and it
actually<00:01:59.620> does<00:02:00.130> making<00:02:00.640> them<00:02:00.730> kind<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.090> look

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
actually does making them kind of look

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.010 
actually does making them kind of look
like<00:02:01.240> they're<00:02:01.510> fake

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020

you<00:02:40.959> build<00:02:41.170> upon<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.830> makes<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.160> more

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you build upon it it just makes it more

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.130 
you build upon it it just makes it more
clumpy<00:02:42.730> rather<00:02:42.970> than<00:02:43.239> like<00:02:43.390> brushing<00:02:43.900> through

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
clumpy rather than like brushing through

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.620 
clumpy rather than like brushing through
the<00:02:44.290> lashes<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.400> allowing<00:02:45.820> them<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.120> separate

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the lashes and allowing them to separate

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.570 
the lashes and allowing them to separate
this<00:02:47.350> doesn't<00:02:47.709> really<00:02:47.800> allow<00:02:48.130> for<00:02:48.160> much

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
this doesn't really allow for much

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.340 
this doesn't really allow for much
separation<00:02:49.270> like<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.810> keep<00:02:50.050> combing

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
separation like if I keep combing

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.080 
separation like if I keep combing
through<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.920> it'll<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.220> get<00:02:51.489> clumpy<00:02:51.880> ER<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
through it it'll just get clumpy ER and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.290 
through it it'll just get clumpy ER and
clumpy<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:52.630> like<00:02:52.750> oh<00:02:52.959> my<00:02:53.200> god<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.940> turn

too much product on it when I first open
up<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.510> tube<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.739> have<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.430> I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
up the tube so what I have to do like I

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.199 
up the tube so what I have to do like I
said<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:13.000> like<00:03:13.800> wipe<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:15.100> off<00:03:15.280> like<00:03:15.700> right<00:03:16.090> here

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
said is like wipe it off like right here

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.020 
said is like wipe it off like right here
and<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:20.320> allows<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.519> go<00:03:21.760> through

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
and that allows like if you go through

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
and that allows like if you go through
your<00:03:22.150> eyelashes<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.750> way<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:24.160> comb<00:03:24.400> through

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
your eyelashes this way to comb through

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.090 
your eyelashes this way to comb through
them<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.110> will<00:03:26.290> separate<00:03:26.680> them<00:03:26.890> quite<00:03:27.070> a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
them so that will separate them quite a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.740 
them so that will separate them quite a
bit<00:03:27.280> but<00:03:27.430> if<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.640> was<00:03:27.790> too<00:03:27.910> much<00:03:28.000> product<00:03:28.360> on<00:03:28.630> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
bit but if I was too much product on it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.030 
bit but if I was too much product on it
then<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.050> gonna<00:03:29.260> keep<00:03:29.440> adding<00:03:29.860> more

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
then it's just gonna keep adding more

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.190 
then it's just gonna keep adding more
and<00:03:30.160> more<00:03:30.310> products<00:03:30.840> another<00:03:31.840> thing<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.140> don't

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
and more products another thing I don't

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.340 
and more products another thing I don't
like<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.459> very<00:03:33.940> dry<00:03:34.450> it's<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.019> kind<00:03:35.260> of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
like is it's very dry it's the kind of

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.930 
like is it's very dry it's the kind of
mascara<00:03:35.739> where<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.040> feel<00:03:36.280> your<00:03:36.430> eyelashes

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
mascara where you feel your eyelashes

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.340 
mascara where you feel your eyelashes
and<00:03:37.000> you're<00:03:37.150> like<00:03:37.269> oh<00:03:37.420> my<00:03:37.660> god<00:03:37.840> they're<00:03:38.050> hard

as a rock

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
as a rock
and<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:41.080> also<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.830> really<00:03:42.310> hard<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.790> come<00:03:42.940> off

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
and it also is really hard to come off

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.660 
and it also is really hard to come off
like<00:03:43.330> most<00:03:44.290> mascaras<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.190> are<00:03:45.519> not

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
like most mascaras that are not

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.949 
like most mascaras that are not
waterproof<00:03:46.150> which<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:46.450> isn't<00:03:46.630> waterproof

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959

it's<00:04:52.870> kind<00:04:53.200> of<00:04:53.290> strange<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:54.850> gonna<00:04:55.030> lie<00:04:55.240> I

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
it's kind of strange not gonna lie I

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.570 
it's kind of strange not gonna lie I
think<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:55.810> just<00:04:55.930> how<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.650> formula<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.340> very

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
think it's just how the formula is very

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.540 
think it's just how the formula is very
dry<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.390> that<00:04:59.050> creates<00:04:59.620> leaps<00:04:59.980> like<00:05:00.220> if<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
dry and that creates leaps like if I

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.030 
dry and that creates leaps like if I
were<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.700> put<00:05:01.000> on<00:05:01.090> Coe<00:05:01.300> after<00:05:01.690> coat<00:05:01.930> I<00:05:02.200> do<00:05:02.590> like
