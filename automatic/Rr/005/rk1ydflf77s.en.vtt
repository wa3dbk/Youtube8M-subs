thought<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.230> interesting<00:00:52.440> because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
thought that was interesting because

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.330 
thought that was interesting because
usually<00:00:53.460> they're<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:55.100> mysterious<00:00:56.100> about

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
usually they're very mysterious about

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
usually they're very mysterious about
these<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> buy<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.289> get

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
these so you have to buy a lot to get

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.040 
these so you have to buy a lot to get
the<00:00:58.620> ones<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.420> mean<00:01:00.690> their

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the ones that you want so I mean their

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
the ones that you want so I mean their
usual<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.500> codes<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.399> those<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
usual of codes on them but those have to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
usual of codes on them but those have to
be<00:01:03.059> figured<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> thought<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.470> it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
be figured out but I thought if it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
be figured out but I thought if it's
interesting<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.489> could<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.670> see
