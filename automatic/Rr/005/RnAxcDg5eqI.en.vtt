00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.990
 of three days between the hunter over 300 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.400
 plays thanks for everything and good here 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.310
 I have the second part that I enjoyed 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.349
 hello that such friends today I bring you 15 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.470
 curiosities about minecraft that 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.720
 surely you did not know part 2 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 the minecraft was originally going to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.270
 called kate gain that translated more or 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 less would be the game of the cave or the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.449
 game of the caves if it stings with your 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.390
 hand a block of office this will take 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.510
 exactly 4 minutes and 10 seconds in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.280
 breaking the blue flowers only 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 found in the minecraft version 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 pocket edition you can not build a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 portal neder on it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 nor can you build a portal 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.610
 allen on the level did you know that the world of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.790
 minecraft is actually a model 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 scale of denmark if you have an eye for 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.250
 Pearl gender ender in hand 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.520
 anderman will not attack you as if 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.520
 you carry a pumpkin on your head there is very 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.979
 little chance that in the beginning 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 of the game instead of writing minecraft 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.689
 write minsk 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.390
 incredible not the sounds that a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.520
 end herman are actually words 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.909
 distorted and they really say 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.909
 something 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.460
 and a golden apple would really exist 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.530
 this would weigh 154 tons to say it 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.899
 otherwise it would be like loading a 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.560
 little blue whale when a skeleton 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.380
 kill a creepers this throws a record of 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 music even if the rest of the hits 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 the player gives them a way to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.399
 to achieve it is by giving four arrows to the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.310
 tripero and then make the skeleton 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.520
 kill him to catch faster the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.979
 fish is best done when it rains if 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 you plan to walk to the end of 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.380
 it will take you more than 820 hours 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.260
 is equivalent to one month and four days 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.170
 water always goes to the nearest hole 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.560
 as long as it is at a 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.049
 5 cube distance if you put 4 seeds 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 of tree together and you give him a powder of 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.870
 bone from there grow to a tree 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.170
 gigantic if a lightning bolt falls on top of a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 pork 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.050
 it will become a zombie pick and if it falls 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 on top of a clippers this becomes 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.080
 in a kripper loaded with electricity and 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.150
 for those who came here an extra one 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.480
 Minecraft is inspired by a game 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.300
 indie of the xbox called infiniti miner 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.790
 and well that was all in the second part 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.459
 of this video have like and subscribe 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.640

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.080
 another curiosity and do not forget to share it
