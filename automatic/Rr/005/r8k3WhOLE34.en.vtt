over<00:00:09.300> here<00:00:09.450> today<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.929> saw<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> lot<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.650> irregular

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
over here today I saw a lot of irregular

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.370 
over here today I saw a lot of irregular
corn<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.030> explain<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> me<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:13.080> I'm

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
corn can you explain to me what I'm

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
corn can you explain to me what I'm
looking<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.160> why<00:00:14.340> that's<00:00:14.519> there<00:00:14.820> yeah<00:00:15.690> so

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
looking at and why that's there yeah so

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
looking at and why that's there yeah so
we've<00:00:16.109> had<00:00:16.139> we've<00:00:16.920> had<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.640> tough

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
we've had we've had a pretty tough

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.990 
we've had we've had a pretty tough
couple<00:00:18.090> months<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.140> standpoint<00:00:20.000> since

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
couple months from that standpoint since

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240 
couple months from that standpoint since
May<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.570> we've<00:00:21.869> had<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.109> 24<00:00:22.830> inches<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
May first we've had about 24 inches of

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
May first we've had about 24 inches of
rainfall<00:00:23.720> that<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.289> hit<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.800> area

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
rainfall that is that has hit this area

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880 
rainfall that is that has hit this area
I<00:00:26.609> guess<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.720> compound<00:00:28.080> things<00:00:28.349> only<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I guess to compound things only one of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.589 
I guess to compound things only one of
those<00:00:29.010> rainfalls<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:29.880> four<00:00:30.090> inches<00:00:30.240> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
those rainfalls was over four inches so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.830 
those rainfalls was over four inches so
it's<00:00:30.720> been<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.170> 1<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.920> 2<00:00:32.130> inch<00:00:32.630> shots<00:00:33.630> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's been a lot of 1 and 2 inch shots of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
it's been a lot of 1 and 2 inch shots of
rain<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.730> caused<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.180> pretty

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
rain and it is it's caused some pretty

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
rain and it is it's caused some pretty
significant<00:00:37.079> flooding<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.070> area<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.610> well

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
significant flooding in the area as well

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.240 
significant flooding in the area as well
as<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.210> nitrogen<00:00:39.540> loss<00:00:39.950> it's<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
as some nitrogen loss it's kind of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.060 
as some nitrogen loss it's kind of
hindered<00:00:42.000> our<00:00:42.090> soybean<00:00:42.660> growth<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
hindered our soybean growth so we got a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
hindered our soybean growth so we got a
lot<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> pockets<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.940> look<00:00:45.539> fairly<00:00:45.809> tough

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
lot of pockets that look fairly tough

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.040 
lot of pockets that look fairly tough
we've<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> areas<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.899> were<00:00:48.899> well

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we've got a lot of areas that were well

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
we've got a lot of areas that were well
drained<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> looked<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
drained that looked very good so it's a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.310 
drained that looked very good so it's a
little<00:00:51.180> bit<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.809> board<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.289> now

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
little bit all over the board right now

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
little bit all over the board right now
here<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.550> research<00:00:53.910> facility<00:00:54.510> there's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
here at this research facility there's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
here at this research facility there's
like<00:00:54.930> four<00:00:55.199> hundred<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.829> acres<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.340> think

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
like four hundred and some acres I think

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
like four hundred and some acres I think
you<00:00:56.640> told<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.010> what<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> testing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you told me and and what are you testing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
you told me and and what are you testing
here<00:00:59.940> what's<00:01:00.180> what's<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> purpose<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
here what's what's the purpose of this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
here what's what's the purpose of this
facility<00:01:01.590> yeah<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.059> 480

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
facility yeah so there's actually 480

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
facility yeah so there's actually 480
acres<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.439> site<00:01:04.799> there's<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> variety<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
acres on site there's a variety of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
acres on site there's a variety of
testing<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> goes<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.409> part<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> our

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
testing that goes on we have part of our

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
testing that goes on we have part of our
corn<00:01:08.549> breeding<00:01:08.820> program<00:01:09.420> located<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

corn breeding program located at this
facility<00:01:10.850> part<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> our<00:01:12.060> trade<00:01:12.299> integration

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
facility part of our trade integration

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
facility part of our trade integration
is<00:01:13.979> located<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.729> facility<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.540> as

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
is located at this facility as well as

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
is located at this facility as well as
some<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> our<00:01:16.650> pipeline<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> chemistry

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
some of our pipeline and chemistry

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.929 
some of our pipeline and chemistry
testing<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> different

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
testing so really a lot of different

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.410 
testing so really a lot of different
aspects<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.960> being<00:01:22.500> looked<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:23.150> my<00:01:24.150> group

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
aspects are being looked at my group

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
aspects are being looked at my group
mainly<00:01:24.689> focuses<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> our<00:01:26.100> newly
