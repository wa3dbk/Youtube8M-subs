 A long time ago especially forgive people

 Te enemy doing the devil from one day hell 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.940

 Although Jack was surprised soul to the devil is said to rain 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.460

 I think I 'll play down before I die 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.180
 There are many demons 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.930
 If you buy my soul, the price is from people 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.360
 Its 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 Make it a silver coin that won't get lost from your wallet when you use it 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.450
 Let's do my soul to you 10 years later 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.310
 Number 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.950
 Then let's become a silver coin that I will not lose for ten years 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.170
 Edit to flash when the devil says so 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.170
 I dived into Jack's wallet 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.460
 Then Jack 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:05.510
 There was also play using the devil's silver coin which does not reduce the number even if used or used 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:07.480
 And ten years later, the silver coin of the devil came out of the wallet and returned to its original form 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.509
 How's jacke 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.750
 Did you enjoy 10 years 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.850
 Well I will get your soul as promised 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.650
 Oh 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:28.000
 It is good to take the soul because it is a promise 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:31.840
 I just promised that it's past 10 years ago and it's still before lunch 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.569
 I want to have a last meal before my soul is taken 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.560
 Does not it take an apple that is the that apple care 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.590
 Jack said that and pointed at one apple tree 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.590
 Hmm 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:55.970
 Well good to enjoy a last meal 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:03:00.120
 Devil tried to take the fruit of apples that are at low to climb to so say when the apple tree 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.480
 Then Jack points at the top and says 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.170
 It is still small 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.630
 I want a bigger apple because it is the last meal 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 Is this a woman 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.730
 OK it's still small 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.990
 An apple in the back of that leaf above 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.870
 Yo 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.920
 Naa's a lot of that leaves 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:33.140
 The devil further climbed the apple tree and tried to flip the leaf that Jack was pointing to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.710
 And I'm surprised to see what's behind the leaves 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.730
 No 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.730
 Cross Da 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.599
 A cross was carved on the branch behind the orchid and leaves 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:55.520
 Jack had climbed a tree and carved it in 10 hours of 5 up yesterday 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.410
 The devil who saw the cross hardens his body with fear 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.410
 I can not move from the spot
