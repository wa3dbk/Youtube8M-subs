it was made by fearless GT yeah I know
there<00:00:17.910> was<00:00:18.029> no<00:00:18.210> cinematic<00:00:18.840> view<00:00:19.080> thingy<00:00:19.410> but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
there was no cinematic view thingy but

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.700 
there was no cinematic view thingy but
this<00:00:20.640> map<00:00:20.880> goes<00:00:21.300> across<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> forge

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this map goes across like all the forge

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
this map goes across like all the forge
world<00:00:22.920> practically<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.060> too<00:00:24.240> lazy<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
world practically and I was too lazy to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
world practically and I was too lazy to
freakin<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.490> cinematic<00:00:26.490> view<00:00:26.699> like

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
freakin make a cinematic view like

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
freakin make a cinematic view like
flying<00:00:27.359> around<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.930> 10<00:00:28.109> minutes<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.500> i<00:00:28.769> went

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
flying around for 10 minutes so i went

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
flying around for 10 minutes so i went
ahead<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.939> sped<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> video<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.590> about

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
ahead and sped this video up to about

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.299 
ahead and sped this video up to about
like<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.780> like<00:00:33.780> three<00:00:34.050> times<00:00:34.260> speed<00:00:34.829> pretty

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
like a like three times speed pretty

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
like a like three times speed pretty
much<00:00:35.460> almost<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> third<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.630> i<00:00:36.719> was

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
much almost at a third but then i was

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
much almost at a third but then i was
like<00:00:36.870> no<00:00:37.170> wait<00:00:37.559> um<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.730> make

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
like no wait um that would actually make

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100 
like no wait um that would actually make
it<00:00:39.210> slower<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.899> anyway<00:00:40.680> um<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.899> sped<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> up

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it slower so anyway um I sped it up

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
it slower so anyway um I sped it up
because<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.770> nine<00:00:44.010> minutes<00:00:44.190> long<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
because it was like nine minutes long to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.810 
because it was like nine minutes long to
go<00:00:44.940> through<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> entire<00:00:45.360> map<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:47.070> turned

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
go through the entire map and I turned

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.639 
go through the entire map and I turned
the<00:00:47.940> volume<00:00:47.969> practically<00:00:48.780> off<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.440> there

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the volume practically off because there

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
the volume practically off because there
are<00:00:50.000> fusion<00:00:51.000> coils<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> background<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
are fusion coils in the background and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
are fusion coils in the background and
when<00:00:52.469> they're<00:00:52.590> good<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.280> fall<00:00:53.550> like

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
when they're good they they fall like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
when they're good they they fall like
pow<00:00:54.920> pow<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> haven't<00:00:57.840> spit<00:00:58.050> up

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pow pow but like when I haven't spit up

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.099 
pow pow but like when I haven't spit up
so<00:00:58.350> quick<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:59.420> like<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> entire<00:01:00.840> video

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
so quick it's like like the entire video

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
so quick it's like like the entire video
so<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:02.070> turned<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> volume<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:03.030> like

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so I just turned the volume down like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
so I just turned the volume down like
all<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.430> yeah<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> kind

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
all the way and yeah it was kind of kind

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.399 
all the way and yeah it was kind of kind
of<00:01:07.140> crazy<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.000> he<00:01:09.000> attempts<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> his<00:01:10.020> jumps

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of crazy so he attempts one of his jumps

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
of crazy so he attempts one of his jumps
and<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> epic<00:01:11.400> fails<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and some of them the epic fails and you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.590 
and some of them the epic fails and you
know<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:14.150> basically<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
know but you can see basically the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010 
know but you can see basically the
entire<00:01:15.720> map<00:01:16.820> either<00:01:17.820> through<00:01:18.450> him<00:01:18.479> flying

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
entire map either through him flying

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
entire map either through him flying
around<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.790> walking<00:01:20.790> around<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
around it or walking around it and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
around it or walking around it and
whatnot<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> pretty<00:01:25.409> good<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
whatnot so this is a pretty good way to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.910 
whatnot so this is a pretty good way to
submit<00:01:26.220> jump<00:01:26.430> maps<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.990> remember

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
submit jump maps because I I remember

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.280 
submit jump maps because I I remember
that<00:01:29.009> days<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.460> Halo<00:01:29.729> 3<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:30.750> people<00:01:31.200> would

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that days of Halo 3 where people would

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
that days of Halo 3 where people would
send<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.770> ridiculously<00:01:32.490> long<00:01:32.729> jump

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
send me these ridiculously long jump

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
send me these ridiculously long jump
maps<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> they'd<00:01:33.600> fail<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> half<00:01:34.530> an

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
maps and they'd fail for like a half an

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.230 
maps and they'd fail for like a half an
hour<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.100> I'd<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> edit<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.119> out

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
hour and I'd have to edit all of it out

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690 
hour and I'd have to edit all of it out
and<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.229> such<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> pain<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.520> they'd

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and it was such a pain and then they'd

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
and it was such a pain and then they'd
have<00:01:38.729> co-op<00:01:39.360> jump<00:01:39.659> maps<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.049> I'd<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.409> edit

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
have co-op jump maps so I'd have to edit

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770 
have co-op jump maps so I'd have to edit
everything<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.220> twice<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.420> wanted<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
everything out twice because I wanted to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
everything out twice because I wanted to
show<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.049> both<00:01:43.409> views<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:45.020> yeah<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
show you both views but yeah so this is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
show you both views but yeah so this is
a<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.399> good<00:01:47.579> way<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.090> show<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.630> jump<00:01:48.960> maps

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a pretty good way to show your jump maps

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
a pretty good way to show your jump maps
if<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.829> quick<00:01:50.220> enough<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
if they're not quick enough that you can

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
if they're not quick enough that you can
beat<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.500> legitimately<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.759> know

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
beat them legitimately in like you know

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.420 
beat them legitimately in like you know
three<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.479> four<00:01:54.720> minutes<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.530> five<00:01:55.890> minutes<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
three or four minutes or five minutes I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
three or four minutes or five minutes I
guess<00:01:56.460> would<00:01:57.180> probably<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> limit<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
guess would probably be the limit to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
guess would probably be the limit to
where<00:01:58.290> I'd<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.280> show<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.880> know

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
where I'd want to just show you know

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270 
where I'd want to just show you know
jump<00:02:00.329> maps<00:02:00.770> actually<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.009> walking

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
jump maps actually you know walking

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.709 
jump maps actually you know walking
through<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.090> jump<00:02:03.329> maps<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.689> be

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
through them because jump maps can be

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.850 
through them because jump maps can be
made<00:02:04.280> ridiculously<00:02:05.280> hard<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.570> can

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
made ridiculously hard because you can

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
made ridiculously hard because you can
you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.849> item<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you know have one item be you know a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.020 
you know have one item be you know a
jump<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> then

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
jump and then

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.570 
jump and then
and<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.510> there's<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.560> billions<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.220> items

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580
