certain number of shots come on do

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.919 
certain number of shots come on do
perfect<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.880> may<00:01:29.969> be<00:01:30.119> perfect<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.810> are

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
perfect you may be perfect there we are

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.349 
perfect you may be perfect there we are
and<00:01:31.109> it's<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.590> fantastic<00:01:32.249> and<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
and it's in fantastic and so that's the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.489 
and it's in fantastic and so that's the
idea<00:01:33.569> it's<00:01:33.719> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.899> like<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> physics

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
idea it's kind of like a physics

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.339 
idea it's kind of like a physics
physics-based<00:01:35.419> puzzle<00:01:36.419> game<00:01:36.599> suppose<00:01:37.169> you'd

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
physics-based puzzle game suppose you'd

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.289 
physics-based puzzle game suppose you'd
call<00:01:37.529> it<00:01:37.679> it's<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:37.889> Facebook<00:01:38.340> integration<00:01:38.789> as

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
call it it's got Facebook integration as

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
call it it's got Facebook integration as
well<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.719> you'll<00:01:39.929> see<00:01:40.109> on<00:01:40.139> the<00:01:40.289> right<00:01:40.409> hand

stage move on to something that I've not
done<00:01:52.200> brilliantly<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.859> far<00:01:53.009> move<00:01:53.219> on<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.459> stage

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
done brilliantly so far move on to stage

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.080 
done brilliantly so far move on to stage
13<00:01:54.119> unlucky<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.249> possibly<00:01:56.249> for<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.520> here

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
13 unlucky for some possibly for me here

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
13 unlucky for some possibly for me here
we<00:01:57.179> are<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.679> game

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
we are so you can see here that the game

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.249 
we are so you can see here that the game
gets<00:01:59.249> a<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.209> lavish<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
gets a little bit more lavish right so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
gets a little bit more lavish right so
the<00:02:01.829> idea<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.669> with<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.869> throw

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the idea is that with these I can throw

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.629 
the idea is that with these I can throw
the<00:02:04.109> basketball<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:04.919> hit<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
the basketball here it will hit that

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.259 
the basketball here it will hit that
switch<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.779> will<00:02:06.840> change<00:02:07.109> over<00:02:07.289> and<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:08.939> can

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
switch that will change over and I can

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.309 
switch that will change over and I can
throw<00:02:09.659> the<00:02:09.810> ball<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.289> through<00:02:10.799> here<00:02:11.299> no<00:02:12.299> oh<00:02:12.689> no

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

this stage basically the balls are kind
of<00:02:59.280> magnetized<00:02:59.879> towards<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:01.859> net<00:03:02.129> now<00:03:02.459> this

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
of magnetized towards the net now this

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.399 
of magnetized towards the net now this
is<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.939> bowling<00:03:03.239> ball<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.569> can<00:03:03.659> throw<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.169> oh

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
is a bowling ball I can throw this oh

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.429 
is a bowling ball I can throw this oh
that's<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.400> basketball<00:03:05.879> maybe<00:03:06.569> I'll<00:03:06.719> throw<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
thing and then it's going to bounce it

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.179 
thing and then it's going to bounce it
on<00:03:09.719> there<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> smash<00:03:10.889> those

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
on there and it's going to smash those

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.849 
on there and it's going to smash those
boom<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.379> gives<00:03:13.500> me<00:03:13.620> better

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
boom like that and that gives me better

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.599 
boom like that and that gives me better
