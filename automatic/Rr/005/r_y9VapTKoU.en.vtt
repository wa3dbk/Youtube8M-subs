all right so Jack is interesting well
Big<00:00:02.760> Sam<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.540> think<00:00:04.440> he's<00:00:04.589> as<00:00:05.190> good<00:00:05.700> as<00:00:05.730> he<00:00:06.029> used

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
Big Sam I think he's as good as he used

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.740 
Big Sam I think he's as good as he used
to<00:00:06.359> be

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to be

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.140 
to be
he's<00:00:06.870> very<00:00:07.140> slow<00:00:07.649> he<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.400> supposed<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.030> like

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
he's very slow he is supposed to be like

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.150 
he's very slow he is supposed to be like
a<00:00:09.240> more<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.599> rush<00:00:09.870> town<00:00:10.110> style<00:00:10.530> character

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
a more of a rush town style character

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.480 
a more of a rush town style character
but<00:00:15.289> ends<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.379> being<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> lot<00:00:16.800> harder<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.310> play

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
but ends up being a lot harder to play

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.769 
but ends up being a lot harder to play
with<00:00:17.640> him<00:00:17.730> than<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:17.940> he<00:00:18.150> used<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.660> if

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
with him than I think he used to be if

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.189 
with him than I think he used to be if
you<00:00:18.869> want<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.109> honest<00:00:19.380> opinion<00:00:21.140> especially<00:00:22.140> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
you want my honest opinion especially in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
you want my honest opinion especially in
a<00:00:22.260> game<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.580> that's<00:00:23.580> fast<00:00:23.910> pace<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
a game like this that's fast pace and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.550 
a game like this that's fast pace and
you're<00:00:24.539> gonna<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> lot<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> people<00:00:25.320> trying

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
you're gonna have a lot of people trying

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890 
you're gonna have a lot of people trying
to<00:00:25.680> juggle<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.400> combos<00:00:26.910> using<00:00:27.779> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to juggle and do combos using a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
to juggle and do combos using a
character<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.349> relies<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.859> counter

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
character that relies a lot on counter

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.580 
character that relies a lot on counter
hits<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.970> movies<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.080> launch<00:00:31.349> you're

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
hits like like movies that launch you're

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
hits like like movies that launch you're
sure<00:00:31.859> okay<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> big<00:00:33.360> combo<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
sure okay now you do a big combo with

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
sure okay now you do a big combo with
stuff<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.250> blah<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> even<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
stuff you know blah so even at the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.100 
stuff you know blah so even at the
Titans<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> off

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 

that<00:00:46.950> wasn't<00:00:47.130> pretty<00:00:47.370> good<00:00:47.520> combo<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.880> was

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that wasn't pretty good combo that was

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
that wasn't pretty good combo that was
only<00:00:48.120> four<00:00:48.390> hits<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.020> tenth<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
only four hits that was just tenth but

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.550 
only four hits that was just tenth but
you<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> rely<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.830> this<00:00:50.040> really<00:00:50.490> slow

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
you have to rely on this really slow

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.720 
you have to rely on this really slow
launch<00:00:52.560> or<00:00:52.770> something<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.250> launcher

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
launch or something of this launcher

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.000 
launch or something of this launcher
really<00:00:54.330> good<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.840> look<00:00:54.990> how<00:00:55.110> slow<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
really good but look how slow it is you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
really good but look how slow it is you
know<00:00:56.130> what<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.280> mean<00:00:58.880> but<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.060> I<00:01:00.590> mean<00:01:01.590> ideally

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.550 

I<00:01:04.119> think<00:01:04.750> you're<00:01:04.839> going<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.019> try<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.199> rely<00:01:05.530> on

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
I think you're going to try to rely on

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.990 
I think you're going to try to rely on
some<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.979> those<00:01:06.040> more<00:01:06.250> quick<00:01:06.490> stripes

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
some of those more quick stripes

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.930 
some of those more quick stripes
something<00:01:07.960> like<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.380> it'll<00:01:08.650> stop<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:08.979> lot<00:01:09.850> of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
something like that it'll stop a lot of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.740 
something like that it'll stop a lot of
attacks<00:01:10.180> coming<00:01:10.450> in<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:12.220> basic<00:01:13.150> launchers

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
attacks coming in some basic launchers

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.480 
attacks coming in some basic launchers
just<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.020> regular<00:01:14.680> launcher<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:18.280> his

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
just a regular launcher and that's his

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
just a regular launcher and that's his
his<00:01:18.880> bounce<00:01:19.180> move<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:20.050> can<00:01:20.200> tag<00:01:20.440> out<00:01:20.649> to<00:01:20.920> okay

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
his bounce move you can tag out to okay

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.430 
his bounce move you can tag out to okay
this<00:01:24.040> is<00:01:24.190> this<00:01:24.970> aerial<00:01:25.570> throw<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.140> pretty

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
this is this aerial throw it's pretty

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.410 
this is this aerial throw it's pretty
good<00:01:26.619> cuz<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.790> probably<00:01:28.000> figure<00:01:28.270> out

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
good cuz you can probably figure out

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.399 
good cuz you can probably figure out
which<00:01:29.110> can<00:01:29.229> lead<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.530> big<00:01:29.710> aerial<00:01:30.100> juggle<00:01:31.409> if

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
which can lead to a big aerial juggle if

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.190 
which can lead to a big aerial juggle if
you<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:32.680> get<00:01:32.770> over<00:01:32.920> there<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.250> time

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.499 

you<00:01:39.500> can<00:01:39.680> stay<00:01:39.860> out<00:01:40.000> actually<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.210> believe<00:01:41.329> in

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
you can stay out actually I believe in

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.910 
you can stay out actually I believe in
him<00:01:41.600> as<00:01:41.719> soon<00:01:41.960> as<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.140> do<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:44.350> yep<00:01:45.350> see<00:01:45.590> see

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
him as soon as you do it yep see see

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.990 
him as soon as you do it yep see see
your<00:01:46.039> shipment<00:01:46.399> came<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.579> from<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.880> other

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
your shipment came in from the other

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.480 
your shipment came in from the other
side

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.930 

say<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.270> could<00:01:56.450> lead<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.720> big<00:01:56.870> juggle<00:01:57.260> combo

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
say it could lead to a big juggle combo

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.400 
say it could lead to a big juggle combo
just<00:01:58.940> by<00:01:59.120> doing<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.420> throw<00:01:59.810> which<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.200> really

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
just by doing that throw which is really

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.090 
just by doing that throw which is really
effective<00:02:00.950> okay<00:02:01.310> um<00:02:02.710> training<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.860> anything

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
effective okay um training is anything

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.730 
effective okay um training is anything
else<00:02:04.250> if<00:02:04.400> that's<00:02:05.120> any<00:02:05.240> good<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> okay<00:02:06.500> I'm

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
else if that's any good this is okay I'm

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.290 
else if that's any good this is okay I'm
sure<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.070> one<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.550> low<00:02:07.730> folk<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.149> has

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
sure that one it's a low folk it has

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.609 
sure that one it's a low folk it has
pretty<00:02:08.479> good<00:02:08.600> range<00:02:08.720> they'll<00:02:09.080> probably<00:02:09.259> stop

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
pretty good range they'll probably stop

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.060 
pretty good range they'll probably stop
a<00:02:09.649> lot<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.039> stuff<00:02:11.320> that's<00:02:12.320> who<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> nice<00:02:12.800> good

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
a lot of stuff that's who the nice good

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.290 
a lot of stuff that's who the nice good
mid<00:02:13.310> Pope<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:13.790> coming<00:02:13.940> straight<00:02:14.150> at

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
mid Pope that they're coming straight at

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.240 
mid Pope that they're coming straight at
you<00:02:14.630> that's<00:02:14.750> probably<00:02:14.900> really<00:02:15.200> good<00:02:15.350> but

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
you that's probably really good but

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.280 
you that's probably really good but
there's<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.240> couple<00:02:17.420> combos<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.050> think<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
there's a couple combos but I think the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.140 
there's a couple combos but I think the
best<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.700> your<00:02:19.850> other<00:02:19.940> guy

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
best thing is just to get your other guy

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.690 
best thing is just to get your other guy
into<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.690> combo<00:02:21.170> something<00:02:21.470> basic<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:21.830> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.770 

see<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.910> continue<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.209> combo<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.660> yeah

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
see then continue the combo with yeah

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.120 
see then continue the combo with yeah
actually<00:02:27.050> if<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.350> don't<00:02:27.530> do<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.709> spin<00:02:27.980> let's

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
actually if I don't do this spin let's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.570 
actually if I don't do this spin let's
do<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
do it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.190 
do it
hey<00:02:28.760> she<00:02:28.910> was<00:02:29.030> either<00:02:29.209> fudging<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.750> standard

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
hey she was either fudging a standard

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.740 
hey she was either fudging a standard
thing<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.820> Ottawa<00:02:32.180> fish

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.910 

see<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:37.990> are<00:02:38.050> free<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> could<00:02:38.800> do

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
see so they are free to do I could do

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.290 
see so they are free to do I could do
more<00:02:39.100> pitch<00:02:39.310> there<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.700> want<00:02:39.940> or<00:02:40.030> whatever

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
more pitch there if I want or whatever

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.470 
more pitch there if I want or whatever
so<00:02:40.450> let's<00:02:40.480> try<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.810> again

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so let's try that again

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.420 
so let's try that again
shit

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.560 

hold<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.700> probably<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.240> best<00:02:51.300> thing<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
hold you that probably the best thing to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.800 
hold you that probably the best thing to
do<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:54.240> probably<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.690> couple

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
do is just that probably a couple

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.480 
do is just that probably a couple
repeated<00:02:55.260> hits<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.650> do<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.980> let's<00:02:56.280> try

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
repeated hits if I do that let's try

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:07.880 
repeated hits if I do that let's try
that<00:02:58.040> shit<00:03:01.310> come<00:03:02.310> on

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010 

laughter<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.790> was<00:03:08.850> gonna<00:03:08.970> give<00:03:09.270> well<00:03:09.810> that's<00:03:09.960> a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
laughter I was gonna give well that's a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.300 
laughter I was gonna give well that's a
two-hit<00:03:10.319> day<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.470> was<00:03:10.680> pretty<00:03:10.860> good<00:03:10.980> 50%

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
two-hit day I was pretty good 50%

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.330 
two-hit day I was pretty good 50%
roughly<00:03:12.209> almost<00:03:12.360> 50%<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.050> 45%<00:03:13.500> damage<00:03:14.160> right

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
roughly almost 50% is 45% damage right

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.780 
roughly almost 50% is 45% damage right
there

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
there

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.290 
there
I<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:15.270> probably<00:03:15.420> extend<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.050> bit

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
I can probably extend out a bit

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.220 
I can probably extend out a bit
that's<00:03:19.300> just<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.540> one<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.960> juggle<00:03:20.380> punch

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.600 

try<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:25.950> what<00:03:26.100> else<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.280> was<00:03:26.370> going<00:03:26.520> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
try and think what else I was going to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.160 
try and think what else I was going to
charge<00:03:26.819> trying<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:27.840> think<00:03:27.900> that'll

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
charge trying this I don't think that'll

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.010 
charge trying this I don't think that'll
hit<00:03:28.380> he'll<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.770> too<00:03:28.920> far<00:03:29.220> let's<00:03:29.490> see

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.850 

the<00:04:31.389> account<00:04:31.719> will<00:04:31.809> just<00:04:31.929> keep<00:04:31.989> going<00:04:32.199> there

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
the account will just keep going there

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.229 
the account will just keep going there
are<00:04:32.979> different<00:04:33.249> juggle<00:04:33.550> variations<00:04:34.059> you<00:04:34.209> can

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:34.239 
are different juggle variations you can

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:37.290 
are different juggle variations you can
do<00:04:34.539> there<00:04:35.639> it's<00:04:36.639> all<00:04:36.759> about<00:04:36.909> trying<00:04:37.089> to<00:04:37.209> get

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
do there it's all about trying to get

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.999 
do there it's all about trying to get
little<00:04:37.809> pokes<00:04:38.369> like<00:04:39.369> that<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:41.110> then<00:04:41.649> try<00:04:41.949> to

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
little pokes like that and then try to

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.409 
little pokes like that and then try to
get<00:04:42.099> a<00:04:42.189> counter<00:04:42.489> hit<00:04:42.639> launcher<00:04:43.059> where<00:04:43.209> you<00:04:43.300> can

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
get a counter hit launcher where you can

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.449 
get a counter hit launcher where you can
do<00:04:43.509> big<00:04:43.719> damage<00:04:43.929> afterwards<00:04:47.309> so<00:04:48.309> I<00:04:48.369> think

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:48.459 
do big damage afterwards so I think

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:49.769 
do big damage afterwards so I think
that's<00:04:48.669> really<00:04:48.909> what<00:04:49.029> Jack's<00:04:49.239> gonna<00:04:49.419> be<00:04:49.629> about

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:49.779 
that's really what Jack's gonna be about

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.929 
that's really what Jack's gonna be about
then<00:04:49.989> of<00:04:50.080> course<00:04:50.399> hanging<00:04:51.399> out<00:04:51.489> to<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.729> next

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
then of course hanging out to the next

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.969 
then of course hanging out to the next
character<00:04:52.089> easily<00:04:52.839> like<00:04:53.019> that<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.589> good<00:04:53.769> to<00:04:53.889> be

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
character easily like that so good to be

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.219 
character easily like that so good to be
able<00:04:54.039> to<00:04:54.219> do<00:04:54.369> that<00:04:54.519> so<00:04:54.699> easily<00:04:55.330> with<00:04:55.629> a<00:04:55.659> throw

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
able to do that so easily with a throw

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.379 
able to do that so easily with a throw
I'll<00:04:56.439> throw<00:04:56.739> right<00:04:56.949> into<00:04:57.189> a<00:04:57.219> tag<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:57.909> need<00:04:58.269> to

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
I'll throw right into a tag you need to

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.059 
I'll throw right into a tag you need to
get<00:04:58.509> out<00:04:58.689> so<00:04:59.019> I<00:04:59.050> think<00:04:59.229> he's<00:04:59.439> probably<00:04:59.739> better

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
get out so I think he's probably better

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.059 
get out so I think he's probably better
the<00:05:00.309> secondary<00:05:00.819> character<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.899> come<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.319> well

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
the secondary character to come in well

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.469 
the secondary character to come in well
no<00:05:03.279> you<00:05:03.339> know<00:05:03.489> what<00:05:03.759> maybe<00:05:03.939> he<00:05:04.119> might<00:05:04.239> be<00:05:04.389> good

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
no you know what maybe he might be good
