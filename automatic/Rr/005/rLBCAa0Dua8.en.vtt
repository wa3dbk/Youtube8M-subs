00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 but this here once a good or bad is 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.170
 a friend of mine from poetry is a claudia 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.389
 perna comma sets like this 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 moment we were never left the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:36.680
 hoped however because it is equipped in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 action I'm wet that 200 will be born 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 201 in apnea 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 all of this after you do it right away but from 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.920
 sometime the diver a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920
 to see 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 This helps here's how you feel 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.630
 Strict quality oil is only when 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 this field what you feel is I try 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:43.450
 it would be transmitted to others 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.290
 definitely what I find and try 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:52.600
 there would be a positive feeling 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.460
 beautiful of the pilot 106 at home 811 mm lab 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.710
 it's beautiful 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 now we lack water in this 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.799
 moment if surely perfection but 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.100
 caused by the residents of fi indeed 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.019
 finished minutes 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.319
 no to go down it takes very little for 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.680
 go up they put mine at risk 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.340
 version of the 211 lasted two hours 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.239
 and there are two hours but why doing 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.040
 how many minutes on 40 m 45 meters per minute 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.709
 descent and instead helps that career 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.870
 also with cylinders and above all hours 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.400
 good andrea is not the gas you breathe 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.219
 community must be anyway 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:51.760
 desaturated 15 get them out and drive the 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:53.409
 time to create the components 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.359
 but in your opinion what is the most city 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:00.800
 dangerous but not dangerous if it comes 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.400
 given everything 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.349
 with the right head 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:13.340
 nothing dangerous and trains is command of the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:16.299
 female world there will be I know only that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.069
 what's there to the real ones you do n't have it 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.920
 with these the odds bettoni country shares 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.959
 woolen 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.980
 I'm going all over the water I don't say almost 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.140
 everyday 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.269
 never feared but some convinced but 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 what is an emotional push for per 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.450
 then be able to check the images and the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.670
 what but how did you come to mind? 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.019
 case 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.730
 the approach this sport is to me 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.480
 always liked a bit extreme sports 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.709
 my dream as a child was it will be very hot 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.750
 just done through his homeland 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.750
 because he was thinking about throwing in the water and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.840
 then of how many 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.270
 in the middle of the game but when I'm at 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.360
 period of events of records that saying 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.470
 almost every day is good then a 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.470
 advertising applause
