bringing it forward to this one they've

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
bringing it forward to this one they've
made<00:01:40.860> some<00:01:40.890> mining<00:01:41.549> speed<00:01:41.909> changes<00:01:42.420> that's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
made some mining speed changes that's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200 
made some mining speed changes that's
usually<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> 1.2<00:01:43.799> update<00:01:43.939> they<00:01:44.939> brought

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
forward apples dropping from leaf blocks

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
forward apples dropping from leaf blocks
they've<00:01:47.790> brought<00:01:48.060> forward<00:01:48.329> change<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
they've brought forward change from the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.090 
they've brought forward change from the
one<00:01:48.960> point<00:01:49.200> two<00:01:49.380> point<00:01:49.560> three<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.950> make

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
one point two point three to make

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.639 
one point two point three to make
pumpkins<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.759> melons<00:01:51.119> grow<00:01:51.689> from<00:01:51.899> stems<00:01:52.290> much

pumpkins and melons grow from stems much

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.679 
pumpkins and melons grow from stems much
faster<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.520> require<00:01:53.880> farmland<00:01:54.509> around

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
faster and not require farmland around

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.530 
faster and not require farmland around
them<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> grow<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.549> fix<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> vines

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
them to grow and they fix the vines

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.899 
them to grow and they fix the vines
which<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.350> fix<00:01:58.649> them<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.040> point<00:01:59.280> 2.3

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
which they fix them in one point 2.3

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
which they fix them in one point 2.3
update<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> been<00:02:00.689> vines<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
update it would have been vines kind of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.880 
update it would have been vines kind of
spread<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.420> surfaces<00:02:04.140> but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
spread when you have on surfaces but

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
spread when you have on surfaces but
they've<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.250> fix<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.659> they

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
they've kind of fix it so when they

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.690 
they've kind of fix it so when they
bring<00:02:06.930> mine<00:02:07.170> vines<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> game<00:02:08.280> they

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
bring mine vines into the game they

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.760 
bring mine vines into the game they
actually<00:02:09.000> won't<00:02:09.149> spread<00:02:09.420> too<00:02:09.569> much<00:02:09.770> other

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
actually won't spread too much other

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040 
actually won't spread too much other
things<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.400> they've<00:02:12.060> enabled<00:02:12.450> mushroom

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
things we got they've enabled mushroom

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
things we got they've enabled mushroom

don't<00:02:13.769> need<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> crafting<00:02:14.340> table<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.730> anymore

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
don't need a crafting table for anymore

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.280 
don't need a crafting table for anymore
so<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.269> craft<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.690> without<00:02:15.900> an<00:02:16.110> actual

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so you can craft that without an actual

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.740 
so you can craft that without an actual
crafting<00:02:16.769> table<00:02:17.269> they've<00:02:18.269> added<00:02:18.629> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
crafting table they've added the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.330 
crafting table they've added the
blocking<00:02:19.170> move<00:02:19.349> with<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> swords<00:02:20.040> which<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
blocking move with the swords which is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
blocking move with the swords which is
pairing<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.120> defend<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.720> your

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
pairing so you now defend with your

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.860 
pairing so you now defend with your
swords<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.950> some<00:02:23.310> passive<00:02:23.819> mobs<00:02:24.120> when<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.690> hit

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
swords on some passive mobs when you hit

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.059 
swords on some passive mobs when you hit
them<00:02:25.019> they're<00:02:25.230> actually<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> flee<00:02:25.950> away

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
them they're actually going to flee away

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.369 
them they're actually going to flee away
from<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.049> sometimes<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.200> actually

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
from you so sometimes you don't actually

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.570 
from you so sometimes you don't actually
have<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.650> kill<00:02:28.890> them<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.220> hit<00:02:29.310> them<00:02:29.370> once

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
have to kill them you just hit them once

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.069 
have to kill them you just hit them once
and<00:02:29.700> they'll<00:02:29.819> actually<00:02:29.970> run<00:02:30.239> away<00:02:30.480> they've

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079

longer<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> spawn<00:02:43.049> which<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.680> cool<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.129> you

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
longer to spawn which is cool so if you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
longer to spawn which is cool so if you
travel<00:02:44.489> man<00:02:44.579> offense<00:02:44.879> they'll<00:02:45.299> actually<00:02:45.599> stay

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
travel man offense they'll actually stay

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.330 
travel man offense they'll actually stay
there<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.379> they<00:02:46.470> won't<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.769> spawned<00:02:47.040> which<00:02:47.220> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
there so they won't do spawned which is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.589 
there so they won't do spawned which is
nice<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.609> can<00:02:47.670> actually<00:02:47.940> grow<00:02:48.120> an<00:02:48.269> actual

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
nice you can actually grow an actual

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.170 
nice you can actually grow an actual
farm<00:02:48.840> they<00:02:49.680> raise<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.040> clout<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.819> cloud

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
farm they raise the clout the cloud

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.449 
farm they raise the clout the cloud
height<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.959> top<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.319> map<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.340> can

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
height to the top of the map but you can

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.009 
height to the top of the map but you can
actually<00:02:53.549> also<00:02:53.849> disable<00:02:54.390> clouds<00:02:54.569> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> want

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
actually also disable clouds if you want

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.449 
actually also disable clouds if you want
to<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.470> they've<00:02:55.590> actually<00:02:55.739> raised<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.250> cloud

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
to but they've actually raised the cloud

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.390 
to but they've actually raised the cloud
height<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.720> top<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.109> map<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
height to the very top of the map so the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.460 
height to the very top of the map so the
clouds<00:02:59.609> won't<00:02:59.819> go<00:02:59.909> through<00:03:00.090> blocks<00:03:00.329> um<00:03:00.629> and
