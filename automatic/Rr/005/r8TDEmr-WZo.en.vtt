00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 source of happiness 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 all we do 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 500 thousand square 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 for example interesting 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.870
 itself of course optimal 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 I think it's fate 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 I think that the brick house 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
 past seven tenths 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.699
 12 percent 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:58.849
 and what is the main 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.209
 obstacle for apple 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 let me close them 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.519
 the same hard and the programs saw that 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.519
 at the enemy 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.889
 all of course 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.419
 for example, if it did not become a real disaster 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.659
 now if the team wants 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.659
 guarantee 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.229
 enough
