that<00:04:04.380> vacuum<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:05.040> in<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:06.030> gently

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
that vacuum go in there and just gently

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.470 
that vacuum go in there and just gently
pull<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.050> off<00:04:07.550> there<00:04:08.550> we're<00:04:08.730> sealed<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.209> again

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
pull it off there we're sealed up again

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.500 
pull it off there we're sealed up again
so<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.959> year<00:04:09.990> I'm<00:04:10.560> gonna<00:04:10.740> write<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.510> try

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
so in a year I'm gonna write on here try

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.740 
so in a year I'm gonna write on here try
these

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
these

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.160 
these
try<00:04:13.709> these<00:04:13.890> oreos<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.670> great<00:04:15.120> thing<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:15.990> I

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
try these oreos so a great thing so I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.819 
try these oreos so a great thing so I
also

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
also

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.700 
also
in<00:04:17.829> jellybean<00:04:21.900> these<00:04:22.900> could<00:04:23.080> really<00:04:23.260> boost<00:04:23.500> in

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
in jellybean these could really boost in

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.040 
in jellybean these could really boost in
morale<00:04:23.860> via<00:04:24.370> kiddos<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:27.720> I'm<00:04:28.720> going<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.900> take

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
morale via kiddos and I'm going to take

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.250 
morale via kiddos and I'm going to take
that<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.330> little<00:04:31.540> test<00:04:31.780> we're<00:04:31.930> gonna<00:04:31.990> put

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
that for a little test we're gonna put

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.350 
that for a little test we're gonna put
away<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.580> we're<00:04:33.700> gonna<00:04:33.760> compare<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
away so we're gonna compare the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.380 
away so we're gonna compare the
freshness<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:35.580> doing<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.880> dry<00:04:37.120> pack

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
freshness of doing this in a dry pack

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.300 
freshness of doing this in a dry pack
method<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:39.250> M&amp;Ms<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.150> then<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.310> another

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
method with M&amp;Ms and then this another

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.860 
method with M&amp;Ms and then this another
way<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.550> pulling<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:42.910> pulling<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.300> vacuum<00:04:43.450> on

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
way of pulling just pulling a vacuum on

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.040 
way of pulling just pulling a vacuum on
it<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.860> sealing<00:04:45.850> up<00:04:46.000> some<00:04:46.240> jelly<00:04:46.510> beans<00:04:46.810> and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
it and sealing up some jelly beans and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.710 
it and sealing up some jelly beans and
some<00:04:47.260> cookies<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:48.000> should<00:04:49.000> do<00:04:49.120> I'll<00:04:49.300> do<00:04:49.510> one<00:04:49.690> of

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
some cookies I should do I'll do one of

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.140 
some cookies I should do I'll do one of
Eminem's<00:04:50.169> as<00:04:50.380> well<00:04:52.590> all<00:04:53.590> right<00:04:57.150> flattening

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
Eminem's as well all right flattening

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.220 
Eminem's as well all right flattening
the<00:04:58.300> jelly<00:04:58.570> beans<00:04:58.870> no<00:04:59.200> it's<00:04:59.350> not<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:01.270> anyway<00:05:02.200> I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
the jelly beans no it's not so anyway I

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.630 
the jelly beans no it's not so anyway I
thought<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.560> was<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.800> really<00:05:03.220> neat<00:05:03.430> little

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
thought this was a really neat little

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.230

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
trick for storing food maybe it's not

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180 
trick for storing food maybe it's not
long-term<00:05:07.570> but<00:05:08.140> boy<00:05:08.290> short-term<00:05:08.860> if<00:05:09.040> you're

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
long-term but boy short-term if you're

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.140 
long-term but boy short-term if you're
able<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.430> store<00:05:09.760> chocolate<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:11.880> candy<00:05:12.880> and

children's morale you and in trouble
times<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:20.200> could<00:05:20.290> go<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.470> long<00:05:20.710> way<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:20.950> just<00:05:21.250> a

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
times it could go a long way to just a

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.719 
times it could go a long way to just a
better<00:05:22.000> quality<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.479> life<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:23.400> just<00:05:24.400> using

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
reseal it I don't know how many times

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.860 
reseal it I don't know how many times
some<00:05:36.010> say<00:05:36.250> indefinitely<00:05:36.970> in<00:05:37.210> this<00:05:37.360> process

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
some say indefinitely in this process

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.469

but<00:05:38.650> you're<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:39.430> know<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.610> can<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:40.120> can<00:05:40.150> test

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
but you're you know you can you can test

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.400 
but you're you know you can you can test
it<00:05:40.600> right<00:05:40.720> away<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:40.990> can<00:05:41.140> see<00:05:41.200> the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
it right away you can see the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.120 
it right away you can see the
indentation<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.360> lid<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:44.040> just<00:05:45.040> to
