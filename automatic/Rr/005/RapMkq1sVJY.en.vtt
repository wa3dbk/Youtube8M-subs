00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.630

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:26.380
 What he has to say is that the liquid is officially in the players life at the end of this season 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.160
 Zest wanted tell you that the link is to another wedding now 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.839
 Have been 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.649
 It's 8 times 27 times. 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:42.030
 What did you retire this season 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:44.890
 I can not do it, so I'm back. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.790
 From February I'll probably had the same thought 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.810
 uh 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:55.570
 I've been thinking for a long time, 4 or 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:01:01.120
 Oh, I thought I would not be able to play soccer continuously, 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.600
 The next garter machine was in a very bad state, 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.270
 I know I can not do it . 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.600

 What 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 I do not think there's anything particularly regretable about this. 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:33.900
 I do not get injured, so I have a lot of thoughts. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:38.340
 I do not feel like I'm in retirement, I do not have a cry or something tears. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:46.160
 Many people will be holding a retirement press conference or something like that. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.160
 I've seen me, and I've been thinking a lot about tears . 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.320
 Today 6 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.320

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.640
 Enjoyed and excited 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:14.300
 That's because I've got better results than any of those experiences I've ever wanted. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.830
 I think it would be something like that. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:23.000
 Had a lot of people look alive again miwoseo of its members 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.140

 I like to pass the word that I sincerely thank many people sipgoyo 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:38.570
 What you ask is a football player in debt to any of Park Ji-sung 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:40.670
 Humanity will end here, but how to invite the love that many have received 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.020
