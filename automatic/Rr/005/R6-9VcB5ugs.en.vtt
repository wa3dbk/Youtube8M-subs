everything<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.700> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
everything which is this stuff is just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.530 
everything which is this stuff is just
honestly<00:01:30.270> awesome<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.710> jump<00:01:31.979> down<00:01:32.009> here

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
honestly awesome and you jump down here

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
honestly awesome and you jump down here
so<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> come<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.829> looks<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so if you come down here it looks like I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
so if you come down here it looks like I
really<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.909> did<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> vines<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
really like how they did the vines and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
really like how they did the vines and
the<00:01:37.170> stone<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.860> put<00:01:38.100> together<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.180> this

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the stone all put together and then this

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
the stone all put together and then this
is<00:01:39.540> actually<00:01:40.229> wearing<00:01:40.650> their<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.759> not

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
is actually wearing their we are not

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
is actually wearing their we are not
responsible<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.479> any<00:01:42.659> loss<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> hands<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> don't

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
responsible or any loss of hands I don't

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
responsible or any loss of hands I don't
know<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:45.090> looks<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
know what this is this looks like a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
know what this is this looks like a
random<00:01:46.619> shaft<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.460> trapped<00:01:47.670> down

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
random shaft that you get trapped down

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
random shaft that you get trapped down
under<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.530> they're<00:01:49.710> almost

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
under and i really like they're almost

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
under and i really like they're almost
role<00:01:50.640> play<00:01:50.880> approach<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> again<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
role play approach but and again this

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
role play approach but and again this
looks<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.710> Moses<00:01:53.220> source<00:01:53.430> exhibit<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
looks like a Moses source exhibit and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
looks like a Moses source exhibit and
obviously<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.170> no<00:01:55.320> Moses<00:01:55.649> Orson<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.189> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
obviously there's no Moses Orson here I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.649 
obviously there's no Moses Orson here I
don't<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:56.759> are<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.570> know

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
don't know what these are I don't know

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
don't know what these are I don't know
maybe<00:01:58.079> maybe<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.219> come<00:01:59.490> up

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
maybe maybe this is where they come up

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.389 
maybe maybe this is where they come up
for<00:01:59.969> land<00:02:00.469> well<00:02:01.469> Moses<00:02:01.799> oars<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.159> come<00:02:02.310> up

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
for land well Moses oars don't come up

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
for land well Moses oars don't come up
for<00:02:02.549> land<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.000> no<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> don't<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for land do that no I don't think so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
for land do that no I don't think so
well<00:02:04.469> yeah<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:05.700> cool<00:02:05.909> i

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
well yeah again so this is really cool i

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
well yeah again so this is really cool i
really<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.479> how<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.869> underground<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
really like how this is underground and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
really like how this is underground and
you<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> whole<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.819> signs<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you have the whole the signs and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
you have the whole the signs and
everything<00:02:09.599> leading<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.459> i

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
everything leading you to up to it i

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.830 
everything leading you to up to it i
really<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.569> cool<00:02:12.720> idea

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
really think that's a really cool idea

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.550 
really think that's a really cool idea
and<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.610 
and I
I<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.430> almost<00:02:14.940> roleplay<00:02:15.450> aspect<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I like the almost roleplay aspect of it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550 
I like the almost roleplay aspect of it
and<00:02:16.849> yes<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> will<00:02:18.870> check<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and yes so if we I will check out the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
and yes so if we I will check out the
laboratory<00:02:20.069> now<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.670> as<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
laboratory now so as you can see I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280 
laboratory now so as you can see I
really<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.660> architecture<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> never

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
really like the architecture I never

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.630 
really like the architecture I never
realized<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.430> extremely

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
realized this is actually extremely

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.690 
realized this is actually extremely
similar<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:24.510> house<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.489> actually

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
similar to my house and this is actually

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.690 
similar to my house and this is actually
I<00:02:27.000> was<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.300> whoa<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.140> other<00:02:28.920> than<00:02:29.130> me<00:02:29.310> using

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
I was like whoa that other than me using

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.960 
I was like whoa that other than me using
wool<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.840> almost<00:02:31.200> identical<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.610> you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
wool it's almost identical so if you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.490 
wool it's almost identical so if you
walk<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.569> looks<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.050> thing<00:02:34.260> isn't

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
walk in it looks like this thing isn't

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.259 
walk in it looks like this thing isn't
just<00:02:35.010> completed<00:02:35.459> yet<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:35.730> I'm<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.120> could

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
just completed yet but I'm it you could

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
just completed yet but I'm it you could
pretty<00:02:36.540> much<00:02:36.660> imagine<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.680> thing<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.190> will

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
pretty much imagine what thing what will

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.850 
pretty much imagine what thing what will
be<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.880> if<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.390> could<00:02:39.599> go<00:02:39.870> down<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.709> could

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
be here if I could go down if I could

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.430 
be here if I could go down if I could
figure<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.099> part<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.290> was

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
figure that part out and I think I was

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380 
figure that part out and I think I was
in<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.709> before<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.209> their

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
in here before so they do have their

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.120 
in here before so they do have their
things<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.049> here<00:02:46.200> which<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.440> almost<00:02:46.890> looks

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
things up here which it almost looks

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.100 
things up here which it almost looks
futuristic<00:02:47.340> which<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.030> cool<00:02:48.239> um<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.080> looks

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
futuristic which is cool um it looks

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.559 
futuristic which is cool um it looks
like<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.500> real<00:02:49.769> science<00:02:50.250> laboratory<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> if

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
like a real science laboratory and if

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.509 
like a real science laboratory and if
they<00:02:51.690> do<00:02:51.750> explode<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.160> create

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
they do explode it will just create

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.220 
they do explode it will just create
another<00:02:53.610> water<00:02:54.209> drain<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:54.930> know<00:02:55.080> they

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
another water drain and they know they

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.720 
another water drain and they know they
just<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.530> replace<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.400> that's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
just have to replace it which that's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.250 
just have to replace it which that's
actually<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.090> cool<00:02:57.450> idea<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.049> design

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
actually a really cool idea and design

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.589 
actually a really cool idea and design
so<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.489> they<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.670> some<00:02:59.819> plans<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.330> really

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
almost every floor is done except this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.390 
almost every floor is done except this
one<00:04:34.169> though<00:04:34.289> just<00:04:34.530> kind<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.740> funny<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.130> don't

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
one though just kind of funny I don't

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.409 
one though just kind of funny I don't
know<00:04:35.460> maybe<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.669> should<00:04:35.940> he<00:04:36.150> could<00:04:36.270> have<00:04:36.360> a

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
know maybe you should he could have a

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.960 
know maybe you should he could have a
low<00:04:36.570> guide<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.110> here<00:04:37.470> or<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:38.400> don't<00:04:38.729> even<00:04:38.880> know

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
low guide in here or I don't even know

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.640 
low guide in here or I don't even know
maybe<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.270> fountain<00:04:39.840> right<00:04:39.990> here<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.470> like<00:04:40.620> a

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
maybe a fountain right here and like a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.080 
maybe a fountain right here and like a
little<00:04:40.830> walk<00:04:41.100> around<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.610> don't<00:04:41.910> know<00:04:41.970> how

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
little walk around that I don't know how

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.320 
little walk around that I don't know how
you<00:04:42.120> do<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.570> though<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.990> yeah<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.340> now<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.270> we

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
you do that though and yeah so now if we

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.760 
you do that though and yeah so now if we
continue<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.139> looks<00:04:46.259> like<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.650> where

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
continue on it looks like this is where

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.350 
continue on it looks like this is where
the<00:04:46.889> path<00:04:47.160> takes<00:04:47.490> us<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:47.789> we<00:04:47.880> went<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.180> way

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
the path takes us so we went this way

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.390 
the path takes us so we went this way
already<00:04:48.570> but<00:04:49.080> um<00:04:49.229> I<00:04:49.350> will<00:04:49.590> continue<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:50.190> way

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
already but um I will continue this way

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.240 
already but um I will continue this way
and<00:04:50.729> no<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.330> snow<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.840> covering<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.979> that's

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and no the snow is covering that that's

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.430 
and no the snow is covering that that's
kind<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.490> obnoxious<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:54.479> uh<00:04:54.539> beat<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.169> snow

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
kind of obnoxious but uh beat the snow

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.350 
kind of obnoxious but uh beat the snow
covering<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.949> paths<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:56.639> maybe<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.330> should

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
covering the paths but maybe you should

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.969 
covering the paths but maybe you should
install<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.960> season<00:04:58.320> Smosh<00:04:58.560> actually<00:04:58.919> you

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
especially like the leaves on top and a

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.020 
especially like the leaves on top and a
Paris<00:06:19.620> or<00:06:19.800> with<00:06:19.979> his<00:06:20.130> little<00:06:20.430> ledge<00:06:20.699> up<00:06:20.970> there

Paris or with his little ledge up there
and<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:21.990> looks<00:06:22.139> like<00:06:22.169> a<00:06:22.380> nice<00:06:22.710> little<00:06:22.830> fountain

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
and it looks like a nice little fountain

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.649 
and it looks like a nice little fountain
down<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:23.849> and<00:06:24.320> what<00:06:25.320> is<00:06:25.470> um<00:06:26.539> what's<00:06:27.539> the

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
down there and what is um what's the

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:28.969 
down there and what is um what's the
point<00:06:27.870> how<00:06:27.990> do<00:06:28.050> I<00:06:28.110> get<00:06:28.229> in<00:06:28.349> there<00:06:28.470> I<00:06:28.650> don't<00:06:28.889> know

point how do I get in there I don't know

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.070 
point how do I get in there I don't know
why<00:06:29.130> is<00:06:29.190> this<00:06:29.400> fancier<00:06:29.909> it's<00:06:30.599> confusing<00:06:30.960> I

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
why is this fancier it's confusing I

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.939 
why is this fancier it's confusing I
thought<00:06:31.229> there<00:06:31.320> would<00:06:31.440> be<00:06:31.470> like<00:06:31.650> maybe<00:06:31.800> a

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
thought there would be like maybe a

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.589 
thought there would be like maybe a
little<00:06:32.130> path<00:06:32.400> so<00:06:32.610> only<00:06:32.789> hiki<00:06:33.180> get<00:06:33.330> in<00:06:33.479> there

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
little path so only hiki get in there

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.600 
little path so only hiki get in there
but<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.960> don't<00:06:34.169> see<00:06:34.440> a<00:06:34.469> way<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:34.860> get<00:06:35.159> in<00:06:35.340> there<00:06:35.490> at

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
but I don't see a way to get in there at

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640 
but I don't see a way to get in there at
all<00:06:35.669> but<00:06:35.849> again<00:06:36.029> a<00:06:36.180> really<00:06:36.659> cool<00:06:36.810> exhibit<00:06:37.500> I

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
all but again a really cool exhibit I

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.140 
all but again a really cool exhibit I
really

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
really

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.430 
really
the<00:06:38.300> design<00:06:38.570> of<00:06:38.600> this<00:06:38.750> one<00:06:38.900> especially<00:06:39.080> the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
the design of this one especially the

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.560 
the design of this one especially the
whole<00:06:39.590> cage<00:06:39.920> didn't<00:06:40.310> look<00:06:40.460> really<00:06:41.390> cool

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
whole cage didn't look really cool

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.810 
whole cage didn't look really cool
definitely<00:06:42.230> like<00:06:42.440> a<00:06:42.590> modern<00:06:43.100> zoo<00:06:43.340> where<00:06:43.580> the

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
definitely like a modern zoo where the

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.000 
definitely like a modern zoo where the
animal<00:06:44.210> treatment<00:06:44.360> is<00:06:44.750> maybe<00:06:45.080> not<00:06:45.170> considered

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
animal treatment is maybe not considered

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.690 
animal treatment is maybe not considered
the<00:06:46.190> best<00:06:46.430> as<00:06:47.020> things<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:49.250> you<00:06:49.490> know<00:06:49.580> the

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
the best as things the you know the

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.120 
the best as things the you know the
exhibits<00:06:50.030> aren't<00:06:50.300> gigantic<00:06:50.930> butt<00:06:51.590> right<00:06:52.100> here

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
exhibits aren't gigantic butt right here

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.050 
exhibits aren't gigantic butt right here
we<00:06:52.460> do<00:06:52.730> have<00:06:53.150> I<00:06:53.830> don't<00:06:54.830> know<00:06:54.890> this<00:06:55.490> just<00:06:55.820> looks

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
we do have I don't know this just looks

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.460 
we do have I don't know this just looks
like<00:06:56.120> something<00:06:56.540> over<00:06:56.750> here<00:06:56.930> and<00:06:57.200> there's<00:06:57.380> a

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
like something over here and there's a

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.810 
like something over here and there's a
cool<00:06:57.770> little<00:06:57.920> bridge<00:06:58.160> over<00:06:58.370> here<00:06:58.520> maybe<00:06:58.730> this

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
cool little bridge over here maybe this

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.910 
cool little bridge over here maybe this
is<00:06:58.880> for<00:06:59.000> other<00:06:59.420> adventurers<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.560> just<00:07:00.740> find

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
stuff and there's a little gazebo over

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.760 
stuff and there's a little gazebo over
here<00:07:02.870> I<00:07:02.900> don't<00:07:03.080> know<00:07:03.170> if<00:07:03.230> this<00:07:03.350> is<00:07:03.380> part<00:07:03.590> of<00:07:03.650> the

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
here I don't know if this is part of the

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.200 
here I don't know if this is part of the
park<00:07:03.980> but<00:07:04.100> again<00:07:04.370> it<00:07:04.730> looks<00:07:04.760> like<00:07:05.000> just

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
park but again it looks like just

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.240 
park but again it looks like just
someone's<00:07:05.510> house<00:07:05.720> maybe<00:07:06.020> some<00:07:06.350> of<00:07:06.470> the<00:07:06.560> park

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
someone's house maybe some of the park

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.700 
someone's house maybe some of the park
inhabitants<00:07:08.120> and<00:07:08.240> it's<00:07:08.540> raining<00:07:08.960> but<00:07:09.530> luckily

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
inhabitants and it's raining but luckily

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.350 
inhabitants and it's raining but luckily
we<00:07:10.040> are<00:07:10.160> over<00:07:10.430> here<00:07:10.610> so<00:07:10.730> it's<00:07:10.880> not<00:07:11.000> snowing

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
instead much more delightful so again

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.000 
instead much more delightful so again
obviously<00:07:14.240> this<00:07:14.570> park<00:07:14.870> is<00:07:15.050> not<00:07:15.260> completed<00:07:15.650> if

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
obviously this park is not completed if

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.410 
obviously this park is not completed if
you<00:07:16.190> come<00:07:16.340> over<00:07:16.520> here<00:07:16.640> it<00:07:16.940> looks<00:07:17.090> like<00:07:17.120> this<00:07:17.330> is

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.030 
you come over here it looks like this is
another<00:07:17.630> exhibit<00:07:17.960> that's<00:07:18.200> maybe<00:07:18.590> a<00:07:18.650> work<00:07:18.890> in

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.340 
again really cool and I didn't see this
before<00:07:30.950> here<00:07:31.760> looks<00:07:32.030> like<00:07:32.180> just<00:07:32.780> a<00:07:32.990> little

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
before here looks like just a little

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.540 
before here looks like just a little
room<00:07:33.560> up<00:07:33.710> here<00:07:33.800> I<00:07:33.890> don't<00:07:34.070> really<00:07:34.160> know<00:07:34.340> what

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550 
room up here I don't really know what

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
room up here I don't really know what
they<00:07:34.670> use<00:07:34.850> this<00:07:35.000> for<00:07:35.270> but<00:07:35.780> um<00:07:35.960> obviously<00:07:36.650> it's

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.570 
they use this for but um obviously it's

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.520 
they use this for but um obviously it's
separated<00:07:38.570> from<00:07:38.660> the<00:07:38.810> other<00:07:38.960> half<00:07:39.200> its<00:07:39.410> like

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.530 
separated from the other half its like

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.380 
separated from the other half its like
the<00:07:39.710> roof<00:07:40.370> almost<00:07:40.790> I<00:07:40.850> don't<00:07:41.000> know<00:07:41.060> you<00:07:41.150> can't

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510 
get in it from the normal thing but just

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.020 
get in it from the normal thing but just
a<00:07:44.630> quick<00:07:44.810> overview<00:07:45.020> of<00:07:45.500> never-ending<00:07:46.460> park
