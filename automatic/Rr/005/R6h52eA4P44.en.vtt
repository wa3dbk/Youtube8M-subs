very<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.470> friend<00:00:43.730> development<00:00:44.730> has<00:00:44.850> been

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
very pretty friend development has been

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.420 
very pretty friend development has been
pretty<00:00:45.180> good<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> bombs<00:00:46.980> eat<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> for

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
keep knocking old buildings down and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.829 
keep knocking old buildings down and
bringing<00:00:49.379> new<00:00:49.559> ones<00:00:49.769> up<00:00:50.150> these<00:00:51.150> gardens<00:00:51.659> and

bringing new ones up these gardens and

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.310 
bringing new ones up these gardens and
it'll<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> quite<00:00:52.379> good<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.320> large

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it'll be quite good it's like a large

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.719 
it'll be quite good it's like a large
town<00:00:55.620> rather<00:00:55.830> than<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.040> small<00:00:56.190> city<00:00:56.430> that's

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
town rather than a small city that's

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.100 
town rather than a small city that's
pretty<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.089> thing<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.390> Sheffield<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
pretty good thing about Sheffield it

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.390 
pretty good thing about Sheffield it
just<00:00:58.409> seems<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:58.890> buzzing<00:00:59.129> city

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it's very nice place to live and I think

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
it's very nice place to live and I think
it's<00:01:01.290> becoming<00:01:01.769> one<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> top<00:01:02.640> cities<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's becoming one of the top cities in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
it's becoming one of the top cities in
England<00:01:03.540> it's<00:01:04.050> moving<00:01:04.559> forward<00:01:04.920> really

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
England it's moving forward really

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
England it's moving forward really
quickly<00:01:05.519> expanding<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.409> challenging

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
quickly expanding and it's challenging

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.100 
quickly expanding and it's challenging
London<00:01:08.250> fast

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.170 

really<00:01:11.800> I<00:01:11.830> think<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.160> a<00:01:12.250> city<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.670> everyone

so I surprised same places where it is
not<00:01:32.370> there's<00:01:33.370> pretty<00:01:33.640> much<00:01:33.700> something<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.360> do

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
not there's pretty much something to do

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.350
