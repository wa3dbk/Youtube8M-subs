inventory and just accessing your things
much<00:00:14.580> easier<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:15.240> works<00:00:15.420> via<00:00:15.690> command<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.320> it's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
much easier it works via command so it's

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.980 
much easier it works via command so it's
not<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.619> virtual<00:00:17.070> chest<00:00:17.400> plugin<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.300> an<00:00:18.600> actual

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
storing command based on commands so to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
storing command based on commands so to
start<00:00:22.650> off<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.699> showing<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I'm just going to do stored it log and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.299 
I'm just going to do stored it log and
it<00:00:41.850> says<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.360> 15<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> logs<00:00:43.500> stored<00:00:44.010> as

let's<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.909> over<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.630> stone<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.189> do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
let's go over the stone we could do

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
let's go over the stone we could do
store<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.229> custom<00:01:10.229> amount<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.770> instead<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
store a custom amount so instead of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
store a custom amount so instead of
storing<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.640> 10<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.510> type

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
storing all 10 because if i just type

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
storing all 10 because if i just type
the<00:01:12.900> store<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.619> put<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.040> 10<00:01:14.310> into<00:01:14.670> my

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the store it would put all 10 into my

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.840 
the store it would put all 10 into my
inventory<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.450> could<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.689> store<00:01:16.049> five<00:01:16.979> what

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
inventory I could do store five what

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
inventory I could do store five what
that<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> they'll<00:01:18.630> only<00:01:18.810> store<00:01:19.140> five

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that will do is they'll only store five

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700 
that will do is they'll only store five
stone<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.540> if<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> wanted<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> could<00:01:22.500> do

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
stone and if I wanted to I could do

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.770 
stone and if I wanted to I could do
forward<00:01:23.549> slash<00:01:23.909> star<00:01:25.880> either<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.270> or

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
forward slash star either all or

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.920 
forward slash star either all or
everything<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.280> i<00:01:32.369> did<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.930> everything

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
everything so if i did that everything

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.289 
everything so if i did that everything
would<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.290> stored<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:35.579> another<00:01:35.880> thing<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
would get stored now another thing you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.380 
would get stored now another thing you
could<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> view<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.180> type

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
could do to view it is you can type

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.800 
could do to view it is you can type
stored<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:41.220> list<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
stored and then list that will do is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
stored and then list that will do is
will<00:01:43.079> bring<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> list<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:44.100> everything<00:01:44.430> up

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
will bring up a list of everything up

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.170 
will bring up a list of everything up
stored<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.659> i<00:01:45.750> enter<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.700> this
