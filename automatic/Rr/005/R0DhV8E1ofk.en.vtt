00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.359
Hey guys we have the brand new Yu Yureka powered
by Cyanogenmod and made my Microsoft.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.170
It was not exactly an in house brand of Microsoft.
So I do not say it's a Microsoft Yureka but

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.750
it's Yu Yureka.
And we gonna do some game play testing none

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.850
the less.
We will start with Fruit Ninja and see how

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.789
it plays.
The Octacore 615 Snapdragon chipset should

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.840
handle it quite good.
And it's actually really really smooth.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.869
On some phones we see fruit Ninja lagging
at the start because it still downloading

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.699
some data whenever you start the game.
But not on this device this device I see it

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:46.039
playing very smooth right from the start.
Which could be very very good sign.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.989
Via 64 Bit processor is there anyway.
Absolute butter smooth and you see my slashes

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.329
are real time.
There is no lag at all what soever ya.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.929
So done testing this one next game.
The next game we are testing is Beach Buggy

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.590
Blitz which is actually quite demanding.
It's a very simple game play but under the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.520
wood lot of things working.
It's very 3D kind of environment.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.890
So see the water droplets are nice.
The game play might look simple but the game

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.900
is actually not that lite on the CPU and memory.
But so far the device is doing really good

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.740
the Yureka.
Note that Yureka does not starts with EU it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.680
starts with Yu and that's the brand actually
Yu.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:51.640
And that's how you get the device name Yureka.
So the textures are not that tense not that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.270
solid or heavy.
But the game play is pretty smooth ya.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.840
So there you go then Beach Buggy Blitz again
absolutely smooth.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.800
Now we gonna test some of the most demanding
games like Asphalt or Nova and such when this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.480
device comes to our lab for full review.
Till then stay tuned thank you.
