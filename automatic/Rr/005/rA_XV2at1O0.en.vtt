okay so this is a saltwater aquarium

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.140 
okay so this is a saltwater aquarium
update<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.150> finally<00:00:06.150> got<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.569> come<00:00:06.750> downstairs

after<00:00:09.150> my<00:00:09.269> surgery<00:00:09.480> which<00:00:09.960> went<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.820> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
after my surgery which went well the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.100 
after my surgery which went well the
tank<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.120> doing<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.509> well<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:12.960> all

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
tank is doing really well it's all

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.609 
tank is doing really well it's all
cleaned<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.660> only<00:00:15.839> problem<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.440> a

cleaned up the only problem is I have a
leak<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.100> protein<00:00:17.609> skimmer<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.180> need<00:00:18.390> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
leak in my protein skimmer and I need to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880 
leak in my protein skimmer and I need to
figure<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.779> how<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> seal<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
figure out how to seal it that's the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.150 
figure out how to seal it that's the
only<00:00:20.039> problem<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.410> have<00:00:22.410> my<00:00:22.590> tank<00:00:22.800> everything

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
only problem I have my tank everything

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
only problem I have my tank everything
that's<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.670> my<00:00:23.880> levels<00:00:24.269> are<00:00:24.420> good<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> my

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that's good my levels are good and my

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.679 
that's good my levels are good and my
tank<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:27.660> ammonia<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.320> zero<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.689> everything

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
tank the ammonia was zero and everything

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.700 
tank the ammonia was zero and everything
was<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:31.769> good<00:00:32.930> let's<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
was all good let's see there's the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.389 
was all good let's see there's the
protein<00:00:35.130> skimmer<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.880> making<00:00:36.750> lots<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
protein skimmer out there making lots of

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.060 
protein skimmer out there making lots of
crap<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:39.829> everything's<00:00:40.829> good<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
crap in there everything's good I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
crap in there everything's good I
cleaned<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> tank<00:00:41.850> yesterday<00:00:42.350> which<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
cleaned up the tank yesterday which it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
cleaned up the tank yesterday which it
was<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.010> nasty<00:00:44.190> looking<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> red

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
was really nasty looking in the red

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.000 
was really nasty looking in the red
slime<00:00:45.570> algae<00:00:46.050> everywhere<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> had<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
slime algae everywhere which I had to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.450 
slime algae everywhere which I had to
get<00:00:47.160> rid<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:48.260> there's<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> hydrometer<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
get rid of there's a hydrometer it's a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
get rid of there's a hydrometer it's a
little<00:00:51.210> high<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.719> because<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
little high right now because I've but I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.740 
little high right now because I've but I
just<00:00:53.280> had<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.670> some<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:53.940> water<00:00:54.329> because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
just had it in some more water because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.709 
just had it in some more water because
my<00:00:54.930> tank<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> leaking<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.820> there's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.510> my

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
my tank is leaking but there's a all my

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
my tank is leaking but there's a all my
fish<00:00:58.020> went<00:00:58.350> green<00:00:59.010> chromis<00:00:59.370> my<00:00:59.789> blue<00:01:00.000> damsel

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
fish went green chromis my blue damsel

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920 
fish went green chromis my blue damsel
my<00:01:00.510> false<00:01:01.109> percula<00:01:01.590> clownfish<00:01:02.930> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
my false percula clownfish the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
my false percula clownfish the
temperature<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> tanks<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.070> 78

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
temperature of the tanks about 78

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640 
temperature of the tanks about 78
degrees

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.770 

let's<00:01:08.980> see<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.600> leaking<00:01:11.230> from<00:01:11.560> behind<00:01:11.980> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
let's see it's leaking from behind the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.750 
let's see it's leaking from behind the
tank<00:01:13.780> it's<00:01:14.260> a<00:01:14.470> seat<00:01:14.770> clone<00:01:15.010> protein<00:01:15.430> skimmer

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
tank it's a seat clone protein skimmer

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.450 
tank it's a seat clone protein skimmer
so<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.000> hangs<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.480> outside<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> tank

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so it hangs on the outside of the tank

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.250 
so it hangs on the outside of the tank
it<00:01:18.460> leaks<00:01:18.940> from<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.330> bottom<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.050> have<00:01:20.170> to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
it leaks from the bottom and I have to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.750 
it leaks from the bottom and I have to
figure<00:01:20.440> out<00:01:20.560> how<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.920> fix<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.520> I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
figure out how to how to fix that I

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.640 
figure out how to how to fix that I
think<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.330> pretty<00:01:25.480> much<00:01:25.600> know<00:01:25.930> how<00:01:26.380> I'm<00:01:26.530> going

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
think I pretty much know how I'm going

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.060 
think I pretty much know how I'm going
to<00:01:26.740> do<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.010> I'll<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.570> little<00:01:29.070> lid

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
to do it I'll just I have a little lid

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.070 
to do it I'll just I have a little lid
from<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.460> pickle<00:01:30.850> jar<00:01:30.880> under<00:01:31.300> there<00:01:31.630> right<00:01:31.870> now

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
from a pickle jar under there right now

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.230 
from a pickle jar under there right now
that<00:01:32.830> fills<00:01:33.100> up<00:01:33.310> with<00:01:33.340> water<00:01:33.460> once<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.090> fills

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
that fills up with water once it fills

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.760 
that fills up with water once it fills
up<00:01:34.450> i'm<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.750> going<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.900> put<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.290> back<00:01:35.500> in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
up i'm just going to put that back in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.250 
up i'm just going to put that back in
the<00:01:35.890> protein<00:01:36.220> schumer<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:37.480> so<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.050> water

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
the protein schumer just so it the water

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.380 
the protein schumer just so it the water
stays<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.860> tank<00:01:39.100> because<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.850> drains

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
stays in the tank because it just drains

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.859 
stays in the tank because it just drains
away<00:01:40.570> too<00:01:40.720> quickly<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.479> come<00:01:43.660> down

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
away too quickly so when I come down

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.469 
away too quickly so when I come down
here<00:01:43.900> about<00:01:44.170> twice<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> day<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.910> feed<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.300> fish

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
here about twice a day to feed the fish

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.940 
here about twice a day to feed the fish
and<00:01:46.690> everything<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:47.200> everything's<00:01:47.590> going

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and everything but everything's going

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.550 
and everything but everything's going
good<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.910> tanks<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.390> uh<00:01:49.420> everything's<00:01:50.350> really

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
good the tanks is uh everything's really

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.780 
good the tanks is uh everything's really
healthy<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:50.979> hopefully<00:01:51.369> I'll<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.520> able<00:01:51.670> to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
healthy and hopefully I'll be able to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.270 
healthy and hopefully I'll be able to
get<00:01:51.880> some<00:01:52.060> corals<00:01:52.479> soon<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.990> got<00:01:53.800> all<00:01:53.920> my<00:01:53.950> live

exactly two weeks from today I could two

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.610 
exactly two weeks from today I could two
weeks<00:03:11.019> from<00:03:11.290> an<00:03:11.620> hour<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:12.099> now<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.670> um<00:03:13.620> that's

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
weeks from an hour from now so um that's

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.039 
weeks from an hour from now so um that's
pretty<00:03:15.040> much<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.280> update<00:03:15.879> i'll<00:03:16.750> do<00:03:17.019> another

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
pretty much the update i'll do another

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.349 
pretty much the update i'll do another
one<00:03:17.530> once<00:03:18.069> i<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:18.430> some<00:03:18.549> corals<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.060> thinking

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
one once i get some corals and thinking

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.660 
one once i get some corals and thinking
again<00:03:19.540> some<00:03:19.840> mushrooms<00:03:20.400> because<00:03:21.400> they're

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
again some mushrooms because they're

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.400 
again some mushrooms because they're
pretty<00:03:21.879> easy<00:03:21.940> corals<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.720> keep<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.170> i'm<00:03:23.260> also

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
pretty easy corals to keep and i'm also

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.580 
pretty easy corals to keep and i'm also
thinking<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:24.040> getting<00:03:24.250> some<00:03:25.319> may<00:03:26.319> be<00:03:26.380> some

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
thinking of getting some may be some

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.559 
thinking of getting some may be some
kind<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.829> polyps<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:27.940> were<00:03:28.030> some<00:03:28.239> polyps

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
kind of polyps there were some polyps

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.750 
kind of polyps there were some polyps
that<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.380> guy<00:03:29.530> said<00:03:29.829> at<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> pet<00:03:30.190> store<00:03:30.220> that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that the guy said at the pet store that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.150 
that the guy said at the pet store that
would<00:03:31.090> work<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.200> low<00:03:32.380> light<00:03:32.620> tank<00:03:32.919> like<00:03:33.130> this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
would work in a low light tank like this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.699 
would work in a low light tank like this
so<00:03:33.760> i'm<00:03:33.790> going<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.150> try<00:03:34.329> them<00:03:34.599> see<00:03:35.560> what

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
so i'm going to try them see what

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.260 
so i'm going to try them see what
happens<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.690> that's<00:03:37.870> pretty<00:03:38.049> much<00:03:38.139> it
