the<00:00:56.309> paint<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.960> cut<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> bottom<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.789> did

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the paint off I cut the bottom out I did

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
the paint off I cut the bottom out I did
this<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> angle<00:01:00.899> grinder<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.559> really

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this with an angle grinder a really

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.719 
this with an angle grinder a really
simple<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.430> people

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
simple way to do it is a lot of people

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.620 
simple way to do it is a lot of people
would<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:08.520> come<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.450> angle

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would think to come in from this angle

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
would think to come in from this angle
but<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.770> countersunk<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> edge<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
but the countersunk just on the edge so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
but the countersunk just on the edge so
you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.200> drop<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> blade<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.790> way

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you can drop the blade down this way

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.080 
you can drop the blade down this way
slice<00:01:15.930> along<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> your

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
slice along and then you use one of your

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
slice along and then you use one of your
little<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:19.110> cut<00:01:19.350> blades<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:22.100> something

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
little off cut blades which is something

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.819 
little off cut blades which is something
like<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.670> tiny<00:01:24.170> end<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.460> come<00:01:27.420> in

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
like this tiny end of one and I come in

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.090 
like this tiny end of one and I come in
like<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:30.049> just<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> over<00:01:31.560> again<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
like this just over and over again and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
like this just over and over again and
it<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.119> makes<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> job<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.380> easy<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it it makes that job really easy and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
it it makes that job really easy and
that<00:01:34.770> rate<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.360> I'll<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that rate it same with here I'll do a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.219 
that rate it same with here I'll do a
straight<00:01:37.200> straight<00:01:38.009> cut<00:01:38.220> across<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
straight straight cut across here and

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
straight straight cut across here and
then<00:01:40.229> once<00:01:40.470> I've<00:01:40.650> cut<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> I'll<00:01:41.520> come<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
then once I've cut it I'll come in and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.960 
then once I've cut it I'll come in and
shave<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.100> dropped<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> tank<00:01:47.790> on

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
shave this out so we dropped the tank on

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
shave this out so we dropped the tank on
the<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.899> frame<00:01:51.079> we've<00:01:52.079> we've<00:01:52.799> risen<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the on the frame we've we've risen that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.690 
the on the frame we've we've risen that
tunnel<00:01:53.939> good<00:01:54.630> three<00:01:55.020> inches<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:56.189> used<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> be

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tunnel good three inches it used to be

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600 
tunnel good three inches it used to be
about<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.840> obviously<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.649> quite<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
about there now obviously it's quite a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.420 
about there now obviously it's quite a
bit<00:01:59.820> higher<00:02:00.170> which<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.350> give<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.159> tank

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
bit higher which will give the the tank

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.899 
bit higher which will give the the tank
a<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:03.000> mean<00:02:03.240> slam<00:02:03.689> down<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.670> has

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
a really mean slam down look this has

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.510 
a really mean slam down look this has
been<00:02:06.119> done<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.099> extending<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
been done just by extending the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.080 
been done just by extending the
the<00:02:10.180> original<00:02:10.810> lines<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> tunnel<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.970> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the original lines of the tunnel and I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.570 
the original lines of the tunnel and I
just<00:02:13.360> again<00:02:14.170> found<00:02:14.710> something<00:02:15.010> about<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
just again found something about the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.450 
just again found something about the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
right radius traced it out and cut that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.160 
right radius traced it out and cut that
out<00:02:18.580> with<00:02:18.730> tin<00:02:18.910> snips<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.720> fold<00:02:19.900> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
out with tin snips and then just fold it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790 
out with tin snips and then just fold it
nice<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.790> clean<00:02:22.290> when<00:02:23.290> you're<00:02:23.380> making<00:02:23.590> the

a piece of inch and three quarter pipe
you<00:02:39.310> know<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.240> marked<00:02:40.600> dead<00:02:40.780> center<00:02:41.170> on

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you know I just marked dead center on

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.260 
you know I just marked dead center on
both<00:02:42.700> ends<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.980> bent<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.520> down<00:02:45.850> over<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
both ends and I bent that down over the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.380 
both ends and I bent that down over the
top<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.810> once<00:02:47.290> one<00:02:47.920> side<00:02:48.100> bent<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:51.390> slide

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the tanks over the top and I was able to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.710 
the tanks over the top and I was able to
mark<00:03:01.450> here<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.010> then<00:03:03.400> Mark<00:03:04.800> mark<00:03:05.800> down<00:03:06.070> here

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
mark here and then Mark mark down here

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.830 
mark here and then Mark mark down here
and<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.870> would<00:03:08.080> gives<00:03:08.380> me<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:10.270> lining<00:03:10.690> which

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and that would gives me the lining which

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.930 
and that would gives me the lining which
I<00:03:11.460> fold<00:03:12.600> my<00:03:14.910> bottom<00:03:15.910> piece<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.330> tank<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
I fold my bottom piece for the tank to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.260 
I fold my bottom piece for the tank to
make<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.270> Bend<00:03:20.100> was<00:03:21.100> really<00:03:21.460> easy<00:03:21.640> -<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> just

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
make this Bend was really easy - I just

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.330 
make this Bend was really easy - I just
got<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> piece<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.720> flex<00:03:23.200> steel<00:03:28.140> plant<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.410> over

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
got a piece of flex steel plant it over

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.220 
got a piece of flex steel plant it over
the<00:03:30.460> top<00:03:31.830> like<00:03:32.830> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the top like so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.760 
the top like so
clamp<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.380> easier<00:03:35.860> fence<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.090> up<00:03:37.620> got<00:03:38.620> what<00:03:38.740> I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
clamp it easier fence it up got what I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.690 
clamp it easier fence it up got what I
wanted<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.460> wasn't<00:03:39.760> really<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.060> hard<00:03:41.670> then<00:03:42.670> I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
wanted it wasn't really that hard then I

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.910 
wanted it wasn't really that hard then I
just<00:03:42.940> trimmed<00:03:43.240> around<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.630> bottom<00:03:46.920> both

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
just trimmed around the bottom both

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640 
just trimmed around the bottom both
sides<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.460> a<00:03:48.640> cold<00:03:49.210> rolled<00:03:49.480> 20<00:03:49.990> gauge<00:03:50.230> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
sides this is a cold rolled 20 gauge a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.760 
sides this is a cold rolled 20 gauge a
lot<00:03:51.040> easier<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.580> work<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:52.180> lot<00:03:53.170> easier<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> use

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
lot easier to work a lot easier the use

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.290 
lot easier to work a lot easier the use
of<00:03:53.920> tin<00:03:54.160> snips<00:03:56.040> doesn't<00:03:57.040> crack<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.730> lot<00:03:58.120> more

much<00:04:01.570> give<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.960> all<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.290> filled<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.370> top

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
much give it all I filled in the top

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.770 
much give it all I filled in the top
here<00:04:03.820> because<00:04:04.120> we're<00:04:04.270> going<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.420> put<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:04.720> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
here because we're going to put in a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.070 
here because we're going to put in a
custom<00:04:04.990> filler<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.760> also<00:04:07.540> we'll<00:04:07.690> move<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
custom filler and also we'll move the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.430 
custom filler and also we'll move the
cap<00:04:08.430> slightly<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:10.630> give<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.900> custom<00:04:11.080> look

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
cap slightly to give it a custom look

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.900 
cap slightly to give it a custom look
I'm<00:04:11.800> going<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.160> little<00:04:12.340> bit<00:04:12.550> sheet<00:04:12.760> work

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
I'm going to do a little bit sheet work

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.700 
I'm going to do a little bit sheet work
on<00:04:13.120> top<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.480> had<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.720> get<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> few<00:04:14.050> dings<00:04:14.350> out<00:04:14.590> and

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
on top I had to get a few dings out and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.080 
on top I had to get a few dings out and
things<00:04:14.860> like<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.040> but<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:15.790> all<00:04:15.940> pretty

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
things like that but it's all pretty

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.479 
things like that but it's all pretty
much<00:04:16.359> normal

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
much normal

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
much normal
as<00:04:19.359> far<00:04:19.660> as<00:04:19.690> welding<00:04:20.289> I<00:04:20.500> use<00:04:21.280> really<00:04:21.669> thin

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
as far as welding I use really thin

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.450 
as far as welding I use really thin
really<00:04:23.800> thin<00:04:24.130> McGuire<00:04:24.699> for<00:04:25.860> welding<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:27.069> 20

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
really thin McGuire for welding up 20

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.300 
really thin McGuire for welding up 20
gauge<00:04:27.610> steel<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.560> really<00:04:29.560> believe<00:04:30.009> that<00:04:30.039> you've

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
gauge steel I really believe that you've

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.999 
gauge steel I really believe that you've
got<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:30.610> thinner<00:04:31.349> fill<00:04:32.349> a<00:04:32.380> while<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.919> you

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
got to have thinner fill a while and you

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.570 
got to have thinner fill a while and you
wire<00:04:33.639> than<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:34.150> material<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:36.370> MIG

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
wire than you do material so the MIG

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.620 
wire than you do material so the MIG
wire<00:04:36.900> comes<00:04:37.900> on<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> small<00:04:38.470> roll<00:04:38.770> cheap<00:04:39.460> easy<00:04:40.030> I

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
wire comes on a small roll cheap easy I

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.120 
wire comes on a small roll cheap easy I
use<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:42.150> TIG<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.479> I'm<00:04:43.780> I'm<00:04:44.289> only<00:04:44.500> running<00:04:44.830> low

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
use a TIG and I'm I'm only running low

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.600 
use a TIG and I'm I'm only running low
amps<00:04:45.550> maybe<00:04:46.380> 15<00:04:47.380> 20<00:04:48.280> amps<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.759> do<00:04:48.910> 20<00:04:49.840> gauge<00:04:50.610> and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
amps maybe 15 20 amps to do 20 gauge and

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.360 
amps maybe 15 20 amps to do 20 gauge and
you<00:04:51.789> can<00:04:51.970> see<00:04:54.419> really<00:04:55.419> no<00:04:56.410> distortion<00:04:57.070> on<00:04:57.190> that

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
you can see really no distortion on that

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.600 
you can see really no distortion on that
at<00:04:57.490> all<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.880> pretty<00:04:58.090> straight<00:04:58.509> I<00:04:59.610> just

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
at all it's pretty straight I just

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.820 
at all it's pretty straight I just
backstitch<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.720> mean<00:05:01.870> while<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:02.650> still
