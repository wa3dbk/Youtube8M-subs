00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
before but basically the concept is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880 
before but basically the concept is
inside<00:01:51.520> you've<00:01:51.790> got<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.530> strap<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> it's

happily<00:06:05.199> get<00:06:05.769> that<00:06:06.779> inside<00:06:07.779> with<00:06:08.049> a<00:06:08.079> little

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
happily get that inside with a little

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.350 
happily get that inside with a little
bit<00:06:08.379> of<00:06:08.439> force<00:06:08.679> I<00:06:08.829> imagine<00:06:09.099> after<00:06:09.189> time<00:06:09.579> it

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
bit of force I imagine after time it

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.019 
bit of force I imagine after time it
would<00:06:10.649> free<00:06:11.649> up<00:06:11.739> a<00:06:11.860> little<00:06:12.069> bit<00:06:12.869> but<00:06:14.819> I'm<00:06:15.819> sure

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
would free up a little bit but I'm sure

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.689 
would free up a little bit but I'm sure
I<00:06:16.059> can<00:06:16.209> get<00:06:16.360> it<00:06:16.479> down<00:06:17.279> pretty<00:06:18.279> much<00:06:18.489> all<00:06:18.639> the

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
I can get it down pretty much all the

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.269 
I can get it down pretty much all the
way<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:18.969> bottom<00:06:19.119> there<00:06:19.679> the<00:06:20.679> desire<00:06:20.979> Zed

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
way to the bottom there the desire Zed

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:27.389 
way to the bottom there the desire Zed
and<00:06:22.409> I<00:06:23.409> might<00:06:23.889> just<00:06:24.009> pop<00:06:24.189> it<00:06:24.339> out<00:06:24.429> there<00:06:26.399> give

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:27.399 
and I might just pop it out there give

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.080
