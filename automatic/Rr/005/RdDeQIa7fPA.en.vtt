00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
everything intelligent has been said

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.599 
everything intelligent has been said
before<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.499> can<00:00:37.769> concentrate<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.519> the

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
before you so you can concentrate on the

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.169 
before you so you can concentrate on the
rest<00:00:38.789> I<00:00:39.179> will<00:00:40.109> deal<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.429> right<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.940> rest

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
rest I will deal with the right the rest

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:43.910 
rest I will deal with the right the rest
being<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> world<00:00:42.809> around<00:00:43.109> us<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
being the world around us because it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.819 
being the world around us because it
will<00:00:44.069> probably<00:00:44.550> agree<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> big

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
will probably agree that one of the big

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.829 
will probably agree that one of the big
problem<00:00:47.249> we<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.089> probably<00:00:48.629> our

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
problem we have is that probably our

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.680 
problem we have is that probably our
life<00:00:49.199> would<00:00:49.499> be<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.829> easier<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:51.449> world

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
life would be a lot easier if the world

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.979 
life would be a lot easier if the world
would<00:00:51.960> stop<00:00:52.079> interfering<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.069> strategy

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
would stop interfering with our strategy

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.450 
would stop interfering with our strategy
the<00:00:54.989> problem<00:00:55.409> is<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.589> you<00:00:55.799> define<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> best

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the problem is that you define the best

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.829 
the problem is that you define the best
strategy<00:00:56.639> in<00:00:56.999> the<00:00:57.120> world<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> world

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
strategy in the world and the world

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.180 
strategy in the world and the world
comes<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:58.469> world<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.769> changing<00:00:58.799> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
comes in and the world is changing the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
comes in and the world is changing the
rules<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.639> game<00:00:59.819> what<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> would<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
rules of the game what I would like to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
rules of the game what I would like to
do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.679> to<00:01:01.920> share<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.249> you<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.639> ideas<00:01:02.969> about

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
do is to share with you some ideas about

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
do is to share with you some ideas about
the<00:01:03.329> rules<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.839> game<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.440> terms<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the rules of the game to the in terms of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
the rules of the game to the in terms of
competitiveness<00:01:05.159> where<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.149> are<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.299> from

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
competitiveness where we are going from

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
competitiveness where we are going from
there<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> whatever<00:01:07.860> comes<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> gwen's

there and whatever comes to gwen's
trying<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> answer<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.689> question<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.259> what

trying to answer the question so what

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
trying to answer the question so what
taking<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.149> portability<00:01:12.960> used<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
taking it from what portability used to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
taking it from what portability used to
say<00:01:13.649> he<00:01:14.640> said<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.969> know<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> real<00:01:15.360> problem

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
say he said you know the real problem

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
say he said you know the real problem
with<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.350> real<00:01:16.530> trouble<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.490> times<00:01:17.990> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
with the real trouble with our times is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.819 
with the real trouble with our times is
that<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.469> future<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> future<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.350> what

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
that the future the future is not what

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.389 
that the future the future is not what
it<00:01:22.859> used<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.399> be<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.250> very

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
it used to be and I think it's a very

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.219 
it used to be and I think it's a very
profound<00:01:26.880> statement<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> future<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
profound statement because the future is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
profound statement because the future is
our<00:01:28.469> what<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> used<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.609> are<00:01:29.729> going

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
our what it used to be so we are going

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.760 
our what it used to be so we are going
to<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> means<00:01:30.689> 20<00:01:31.079> years<00:01:31.259> ago<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.649> I

were<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:35.850> University<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.660> they<00:03:36.870> told<00:03:37.140> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
were at University and they told you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.050 
were at University and they told you
about<00:03:37.440> economics<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.340> was<00:03:38.670> all<00:03:38.820> about

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
about economics it was all about

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.060 
about economics it was all about
interests<00:03:39.510> budget<00:03:40.080> for<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.830> immensely

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
interests budget for it was immensely

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.310 
interests budget for it was immensely
exciting<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.610> now<00:03:44.940> what<00:03:45.330> we<00:03:45.600> are<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.140> are

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
exciting and now what we are we are

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080 
exciting and now what we are we are
doing<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.100> are<00:03:47.250> looking<00:03:47.670> at<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> wide

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
doing is that we are looking at a wide

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.820 
doing is that we are looking at a wide
angle<00:03:48.300> at<00:03:48.600> fruit<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.170> are<00:03:49.320> looking<00:03:49.650> at

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
angle at fruit we are looking at

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.240 
angle at fruit we are looking at
infrastructures<00:03:50.700> government<00:03:51.420> education

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
infrastructures government education

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.010 
infrastructures government education
motivation<00:03:53.250> technology<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.480> those<00:03:54.690> kind<00:03:54.930> of

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
motivation technology all those kind of

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.660 
motivation technology all those kind of
things<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.470> didn't<00:03:55.770> learn<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.550> at

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
things we didn't learn you know at

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.910 
things we didn't learn you know at
University<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.350> think<00:03:58.470> are<00:03:58.770> very

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
University and that I think are very

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.890 
University and that I think are very
important<00:03:59.550> for<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> success<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.450> country

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
important for the success of a country

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.740 
important for the success of a country
or<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:02.100> company<00:04:02.610> now<00:04:03.180> when<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.510> are<00:04:03.630> looking

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
or of a company now when you are looking

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.060 
or of a company now when you are looking
with<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.410> most<00:04:04.710> competitive<00:04:05.250> atlet<00:04:06.210> today

with the most competitive atlet today

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.770 
with the most competitive atlet today
you<00:04:08.070> probably<00:04:08.280> would<00:04:08.790> say<00:04:08.970> tiger<00:04:09.300> woods<00:04:09.660> and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
you probably would say tiger woods and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.050 
you probably would say tiger woods and
it<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.290> indeed<00:04:10.560> highly<00:04:11.010> competitive<00:04:11.550> or<00:04:11.880> some

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
it is indeed highly competitive or some

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.910 
it is indeed highly competitive or some
of<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.300> material<00:04:12.810> Federer<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.350> would<00:04:13.680> agree

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
of you material Federer I would agree

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.520 
of you material Federer I would agree

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530

Woods<00:04:19.830> is<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.220> right<00:04:20.460> guy<00:04:20.730> because<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.420> know

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
Woods is the right guy because you know

he runs 87 million dollars last year so

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.810 
he runs 87 million dollars last year so
we<00:04:24.150> must<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.450> something<00:04:24.480> good<00:04:25.670> actually<00:04:26.670> it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we must do something good actually it's

playing<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.420> spring<00:04:28.020> really<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.910> plane

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
playing to a spring really this plane

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.770 
playing to a spring really this plane
goes<00:04:30.240> very<00:04:30.840> well<00:04:31.460> yes<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:32.790> it's<00:04:33.300> paying<00:04:33.600> off

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
goes very well yes but it's paying off

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.150 
goes very well yes but it's paying off
is<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.140> enough<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.440> need<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> right

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
is not enough you need to have the right

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.710 
is not enough you need to have the right
claps<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.730> have<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.910> right<00:04:36.270> caddy<00:04:36.570> but

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
claps you have a right caddy but

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.210 
claps you have a right caddy but
especially<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.470> will<00:04:37.680> need<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.890> have<00:04:38.070> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
especially you will need to have the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.640 
especially you will need to have the
right<00:04:38.400> mental<00:04:38.880> approach<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.900> right<00:04:40.110> sense<00:04:40.440> of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
right mental approach the right sense of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.890 
right mental approach the right sense of
purpose<00:04:40.940> actually<00:04:41.940> competitiveness<00:04:42.720> is

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
purpose actually competitiveness is

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.050 
purpose actually competitiveness is
managing<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.590> totality<00:04:43.980> of<00:04:44.250> competence<00:04:44.880> you

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
managing a totality of competence you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.610 
managing a totality of competence you
are<00:04:45.180> never<00:04:45.420> competitive<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> are<00:04:46.470> good

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
are never competitive if you are good

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.410 
are never competitive if you are good
only<00:04:46.710> at<00:04:46.920> one<00:04:47.100> thing<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.970> think<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.240> is

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
only at one thing and I think this is

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.790 
only at one thing and I think this is
one<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.840> things<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.200> are<00:04:49.350> going<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.680> look

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
one of the things we are going to look

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.620 
one of the things we are going to look
at<00:04:50.010> together<00:04:50.370> but<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.420> big<00:04:51.600> difference

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
at together but the big difference

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.370 
at together but the big difference
between<00:04:52.280> golf<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:54.080> competitiveness<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.260> that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
between golf and competitiveness is that

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.520 
between golf and competitiveness is that
engulfed<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.370> win<00:04:56.610> by<00:04:56.850> one<00:04:57.210> shot<00:04:57.600> while

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
engulfed you can win by one shot while

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.410 
engulfed you can win by one shot while
in<00:04:58.710> competitiveness<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.820> name<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.270> game

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
in competitiveness the name of the game

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.900 
in competitiveness the name of the game
is<00:05:00.600> following<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:01.890> are<00:05:02.010> their<00:05:02.250> number<00:05:02.670> one

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
is following you are their number one

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.520 
is following you are their number one
obviously<00:05:03.150> otherwise<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.140> will<00:05:04.260> not<00:05:04.320> be

obviously otherwise you will not be
there<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:05.010> then<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.120> all<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.420> others

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.620 
are doing the bigger the more money you
do<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.860> therefore<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.670> have<00:05:26.790> two<00:05:26.970> drivers<00:05:27.450> in

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
do and therefore you have two drivers in

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.210 
do and therefore you have two drivers in
competitiveness<00:05:28.260> number<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.190> a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
competitiveness number one is a

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.370 
competitiveness number one is a
management<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.850> efficiency<00:05:30.390> we<00:05:31.020> are<00:05:31.170> all

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
management of efficiency we are all

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.240 
management of efficiency we are all
supposed<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:32.130> deliver<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:33.270> goods<00:05:33.540> profit<00:05:34.350> the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
supposed to deliver the goods profit the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.240 
supposed to deliver the goods profit the
second<00:05:35.760> thing<00:05:35.970> is<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> management<00:05:36.720> of<00:05:37.020> change

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
second thing is a management of change

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.530 
second thing is a management of change
we<00:05:38.250> are<00:05:38.370> supposed<00:05:38.730> to<00:05:38.820> manage<00:05:39.120> change<00:05:39.390> and

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
we are supposed to manage change and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.030 
we are supposed to manage change and
when<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.750> think<00:05:39.960> about<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:40.260> this<00:05:40.530> is<00:05:40.590> what<00:05:40.860> we

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
when you think about it this is what we

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.090 
when you think about it this is what we
do<00:05:41.160> all<00:05:41.280> day<00:05:41.460> long<00:05:41.610> efficiency<00:05:42.570> change<00:05:43.410> the

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
do all day long efficiency change the

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.280 
do all day long efficiency change the
real<00:05:44.340> fundamental<00:05:44.700> question<00:05:45.540> we<00:05:45.720> all<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.110> is

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
real fundamental question we all have is

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.040 
real fundamental question we all have is
the<00:05:46.410> following<00:05:46.890> is<00:05:47.640> in<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.300> same<00:05:48.570> people<00:05:48.780> that

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
the following is in the same people that

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.040 
the following is in the same people that
can<00:05:49.380> do<00:05:49.530> books<00:05:50.030> because<00:05:51.030> when<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.480> are<00:05:51.630> very

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
can do books because when you are very

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.890 
can do books because when you are very
efficient<00:05:52.830> you<00:05:53.400> are<00:05:53.430> very<00:05:53.880> successful<00:05:54.690> and

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
efficient you are very successful and

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.530 
efficient you are very successful and
when<00:05:55.410> you<00:05:55.530> are<00:05:55.650> very<00:05:55.680> successful<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:57.330> don't

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
when you are very successful you don't

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.110 
when you are very successful you don't
want<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.810> change<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.980> this<00:05:59.250> is<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.520> challenge

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
want to change and this is a challenge

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.780 
want to change and this is a challenge
how<00:06:00.510> do<00:06:00.570> you<00:06:00.930> have<00:06:01.170> successful<00:06:01.830> people<00:06:02.040> change

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
how do you have successful people change

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.850 
how do you have successful people change
and<00:06:03.030> this<00:06:03.750> is<00:06:03.960> one<00:06:04.140> of<00:06:04.170> the<00:06:04.380> nightmare<00:06:04.830> of

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
and this is one of the nightmare of

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.470 
and this is one of the nightmare of
modern<00:06:05.250> management<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.910> we<00:06:06.000> are<00:06:06.120> going<00:06:06.360> to

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
modern management and we are going to

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.360 
modern management and we are going to
see<00:06:06.630> what<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:06.870> means<00:06:07.050> because<00:06:07.800> changes

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
see what it means because changes

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.800 
see what it means because changes
everywhere<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:08.880> told<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.330> about<00:06:09.540> the<00:06:09.660> wide

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
everywhere I told you about the wide

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.710 
everywhere I told you about the wide
angle<00:06:09.990> approach<00:06:10.580> biology<00:06:11.580> give<00:06:12.180> us<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.450> lot<00:06:12.600> of

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
angle approach biology give us a lot of

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.950 
angle approach biology give us a lot of
ideas<00:06:12.840> if<00:06:13.350> you<00:06:13.590> look<00:06:13.800> at<00:06:14.040> your<00:06:14.280> body<00:06:14.720> you<00:06:15.720> will

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
ideas if you look at your body you will

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.170 
ideas if you look at your body you will
find<00:06:16.290> that<00:06:16.410> all<00:06:16.530> your<00:06:17.070> body<00:06:17.370> cells<00:06:17.820> are

is<00:06:24.780> a<00:06:24.810> gentleman<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:26.400> is<00:06:26.670> a<00:06:26.700> very<00:06:26.940> good<00:06:27.270> news

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.860 

because<00:06:31.470> it<00:06:31.680> means<00:06:31.860> the<00:06:32.160> following<00:06:32.810> if<00:06:33.810> you

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
because it means the following if you

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
about qualitative change if you take the

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.600 
about qualitative change if you take the
land<00:06:55.000> of<00:06:55.180> that<00:06:55.389> many<00:06:55.630> at<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:55.990> brain<00:06:56.169> of<00:06:56.610> 1600

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
land of that many at the brain of 1600

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.659 
land of that many at the brain of 1600
cubic<00:06:57.940> centimeters<00:06:58.600> is<00:06:59.080> our<00:06:59.380> brain<00:06:59.740> bigger<00:07:00.250> or

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
cubic centimeters is our brain bigger or

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.230 
cubic centimeters is our brain bigger or
smaller<00:07:01.410> actually<00:07:02.410> yes<00:07:02.770> it's<00:07:03.100> smaller<00:07:03.370> we

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
smaller actually yes it's smaller we

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.909 
smaller actually yes it's smaller we
have<00:07:04.360> a<00:07:04.389> smaller<00:07:04.810> brain<00:07:05.110> are<00:07:05.380> we<00:07:05.530> more<00:07:05.710> or<00:07:05.770> less

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
have a smaller brain are we more or less

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.830 
have a smaller brain are we more or less
intelligence<00:07:06.580> that's<00:07:06.940> another<00:07:07.180> story<00:07:07.330> look

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
intelligence that's another story look

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.680 
intelligence that's another story look
we<00:07:07.960> have<00:07:08.050> asked<00:07:08.229> elaborate<00:07:09.030> very<00:07:10.030> interesting

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
we have asked elaborate very interesting

and finally for the short introduction

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.120 
and finally for the short introduction
and<00:07:12.789> competitiveness<00:07:13.630> a<00:07:13.900> very<00:07:14.800> nice

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
and competitiveness a very nice

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.089 
and competitiveness a very nice
relationship<00:07:15.550> which<00:07:16.150> was<00:07:16.360> done<00:07:16.630> and

relationship which was done and

00:07:17.099 --> 01:37:33.150 
relationship which was done and
discovered<00:07:18.099> between<00:07:18.250> competitive
