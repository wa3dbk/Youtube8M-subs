me a goal from a corner right there and
I<00:01:34.799> definitely<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.250> recommend<00:01:35.490> trying<00:01:35.820> him<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
I definitely do recommend trying him out
as<00:01:36.210> he's<00:01:36.359> a<00:01:36.390> pretty<00:01:36.750> solid<00:01:37.020> player<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.979> anyway

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
as he's a pretty solid player but anyway

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
as he's a pretty solid player but anyway
we're<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.429> move<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.119> goalkeeper<00:01:40.020> of

walk up he caught the eye of a lot of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.099 
walk up he caught the eye of a lot of
teams<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:47.459> Barcelona<00:02:48.120> were<00:02:48.209> lucky<00:02:48.750> enough<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
teams and Barcelona were lucky enough to

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.319 
teams and Barcelona were lucky enough to
get<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.349> believe<00:02:49.590> money<00:02:49.829> was<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.310> close<00:02:50.609> to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
get my believe money was so close to

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.819 
get my believe money was so close to
getting<00:02:51.599> him<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.870> bus<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> did<00:02:52.530> beat<00:02:52.680> Man

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
getting him a bus on I did beat Man

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.500 
getting him a bus on I did beat Man
United<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.310> his<00:02:53.430> signature<00:02:53.640> which<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.269> believe

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
United to his signature which I believe

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.720 
United to his signature which I believe
was<00:02:54.750> around<00:02:54.989> 30<00:02:55.409> million<00:02:55.799> euros<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.549> time

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
was around 30 million euros at the time

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.849 
was around 30 million euros at the time
so<00:02:57.359> again<00:02:57.659> that<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.049> pretty<00:02:58.319> cheap<00:02:58.560> price

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
so again that is a pretty cheap price

pretty well except for name I'm just in

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.850 
pretty well except for name I'm just in
my<00:06:21.030> opinion<00:06:21.150> Neymar<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:21.960> just<00:06:22.230> a<00:06:22.350> bad<00:06:22.590> player

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
my opinion Neymar is just a bad player

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.800 
my opinion Neymar is just a bad player
in<00:06:23.010> this<00:06:23.100> game<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.760> central<00:06:24.150> position<00:06:24.300> and

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
in this game in a central position and

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.170 
in this game in a central position and
he<00:06:25.320> is<00:06:25.440> much<00:06:25.680> suited<00:06:26.130> to<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.280> winger<00:06:26.760> position

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
he is much suited to a winger position

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.970 
he is much suited to a winger position
in<00:06:27.300> my<00:06:27.390> opinion<00:06:27.780> so<00:06:28.050> if<00:06:28.290> you're<00:06:28.440> gonna<00:06:28.560> think

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
in my opinion so if you're gonna think

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.320 
in my opinion so if you're gonna think
of<00:06:29.130> getting<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:29.400> barsen<00:06:29.730> and<00:06:29.850> a<00:06:29.910> Nima<00:06:30.090> I
