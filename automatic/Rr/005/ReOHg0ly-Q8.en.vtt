00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
anyway these are just quarks I had and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.230 
anyway these are just quarks I had and
this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> another<00:00:18.750> idea<00:00:19.369> that<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> saw<00:00:20.850> on

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this is another idea that I saw on

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.310 
this is another idea that I saw on
Pinterest<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.760> I<00:00:23.810> live<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.840> Southern

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
Pinterest and I live in Southern

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
Pinterest and I live in Southern
California<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.820> ceiling

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
California so we have a lot of ceiling

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.830 
California so we have a lot of ceiling
fans<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.369> things<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.210> why<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
fans and things like that and why so

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479 
fans and things like that and why so
that<00:00:30.869> means<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> light<00:00:32.130> poles

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that means we have a lot of light poles

the<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.600> long<00:02:06.840> stick<00:02:07.380> pins<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.340> just

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the really long stick pins but it just

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.630 
the really long stick pins but it just
depends<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.149> long<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.629> cork<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.640> now

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
depends on how long your cork is now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.580 
depends on how long your cork is now
this<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
this is the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.930 
this is the
that<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.430> used<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.810> probably<00:02:15.380> an<00:02:15.590> 18-gauge<00:02:16.490> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
that I used it's probably an 18-gauge I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.199 
that I used it's probably an 18-gauge I
don't<00:02:17.120> know<00:02:17.209> can<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.150> just

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
don't know can you see that and I just

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.449 
don't know can you see that and I just
cut<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.600> off<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.959> had<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> row<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.430> just

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
cut it off I had a row of it and I just

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.699 
cut it off I had a row of it and I just
cut<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.940> off<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.300> because<00:02:23.690> what<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.319> have<00:02:24.530> to

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
cut it off that because what you have to

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.730 
cut it off that because what you have to
do<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.160> have<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.819> piece<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.270> wire<00:02:26.740> let

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
do you have to have a piece of wire let

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.010 
do you have to have a piece of wire let
me<00:02:27.830> show<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.400> small<00:02:28.730> quick<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.270> got<00:02:29.480> you

have to have a piece of wire I've just

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.309 
have to have a piece of wire I've just
salt<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.680> hot<00:02:34.100> blue<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.520> over<00:02:34.850> me<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:36.140> will

salt and hot blue all over me that will

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.720 
salt and hot blue all over me that will
go<00:02:36.530> completely<00:02:36.830> through<00:02:38.500> your<00:02:39.500> clerk<00:02:39.980> at<00:02:40.400> the

go completely through your clerk at the
other<00:02:40.940> end<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.970> need<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.480> fix

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
other end because you need to fix

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.190 
other end because you need to fix
something<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:46.040> hang<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.670> other

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
something that you can hang your other

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.360 
something that you can hang your other
your<00:02:48.310> embellishments<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.200> hook<00:02:51.200> stuff<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.860> so

your embellishments and hook stuff to so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.729 
your embellishments and hook stuff to so
you<00:02:52.430> need<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> piece<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.300> wire<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:54.350> will<00:02:54.560> go

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
you need a piece of wire that will go

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.500 
you need a piece of wire that will go
completely<00:02:54.980> through<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.820> corner<00:02:56.269> long

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
completely through the corner long

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.570 
completely through the corner long
enough<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.989> come<00:02:57.200> out<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.500> other<00:02:57.680> end<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
enough to come out the other end and you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.080 
enough to come out the other end and you
also<00:02:58.880> need<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.989> long<00:03:00.290> enough<00:03:00.940> after<00:03:01.940> you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
also need it to be long enough after you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.900 
also need it to be long enough after you
do<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.410> put<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.950> loop<00:03:04.340> at<00:03:04.610> each

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
do that that you can put a loop at each

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.910 
do that that you can put a loop at each
end<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.819> just<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:09.140> loop<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:09.830> you

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
end you know just you know a loop so you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:18.449 
end you know just you know a loop so you
can<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:12.260> like<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.239> let's<00:03:18.140> see

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
can just like this you know let's see

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.270 
can just like this you know let's see
it's<00:03:19.459> kind<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> hard<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.280> know

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's kind of hard to do here you know

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.300 
it's kind of hard to do here you know
you<00:03:22.430> just<00:03:22.610> need<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> loop<00:03:23.209> well<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you just need a loop well you get the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.960 
you just need a loop well you get the
idea

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
idea

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.720 
idea
you<00:03:26.630> need<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.840> loop<00:03:27.110> like<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.950> each<00:03:27.980> end

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
you need a loop like this on each end

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.670 
you need a loop like this on each end
and<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:30.019> way<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.530> hang<00:03:30.860> your<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.530> know

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
and that way you can hang your you know

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.370 
and that way you can hang your you know
hang<00:03:33.950> your<00:03:34.269> embellishments<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.780> things

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
hang your embellishments and and things

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.960 
hang your embellishments and and things
off<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.739> Sally<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.250> might<00:03:37.430> quite<00:03:37.700> long

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
off and Sally it might quite long

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.370 
off and Sally it might quite long
because<00:03:38.090> mines<00:03:38.420> come<00:03:38.690> all<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.930> way<00:03:38.959> down<00:03:39.200> to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
because mines come all the way down to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.449 
because mines come all the way down to
here<00:03:39.530> out<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:39.950> one

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
here out of this one

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.740 
here out of this one
and<00:03:41.680> stepping<00:03:42.680> all<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.190> way<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:44.120> here<00:03:44.510> because

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
and stepping all the way up here because

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.110 
and stepping all the way up here because
I<00:03:44.930> added<00:03:45.410> all<00:03:45.500> these<00:03:45.769> things<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.910> know<00:03:47.060> you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
I added all these things so you know you

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.530 
I added all these things so you know you
do<00:03:47.720> need<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.170> leave<00:03:48.380> your<00:03:48.620> wire<00:03:49.299> fairly<00:03:50.299> long

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
do need to leave your wire fairly long

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.569 
do need to leave your wire fairly long
and<00:03:50.810> what<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.959> did<00:03:51.260> was<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.590> made<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.799> loop<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.340> one

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
and what I did was I made a loop on one

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.479 
and what I did was I made a loop on one
end<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:53.090> then<00:03:53.780> stuck<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.410> down<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.799> my<00:03:54.950> cork

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
end and then stuck it down in my cork

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.199 
end and then stuck it down in my cork
and<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:57.230> was<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:58.010> was<00:03:58.130> too<00:03:58.430> long<00:03:58.609> I<00:03:58.820> left<00:03:59.000> my

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and it was it was too long I left my

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.090 
and it was it was too long I left my
plenty<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.690> left<00:04:00.140> myself<00:04:00.500> cleaning<00:04:00.709> room<00:04:00.920> and

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
plenty of left myself cleaning room and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.240 
plenty of left myself cleaning room and
then<00:04:01.250> up<00:04:01.370> at<00:04:01.549> my<00:04:01.670> embellishments<00:04:02.829> only<00:04:03.829> before

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
then up at my embellishments only before

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.060 
then up at my embellishments only before
I<00:04:04.310> ever<00:04:04.519> cut<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> off<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:06.470> made<00:04:06.680> my<00:04:06.859> loop

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
I ever cut it off and then made my loop

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.979 
I ever cut it off and then made my loop
at<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.280> other<00:04:07.430> end<00:04:07.880> which<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.390> can<00:04:08.540> see<00:04:08.780> mine

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
at the other end which you can see mine

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.650 
at the other end which you can see mine
right<00:04:09.200> here<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.680> then<00:04:10.100> see<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.370> added<00:04:10.640> this<00:04:11.090> so

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
right here and then see I added this so

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.050
