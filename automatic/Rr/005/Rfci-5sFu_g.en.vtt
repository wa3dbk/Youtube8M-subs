00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.490
 at this height the best 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.040
 recommendations that we can give is 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.140
 first and foremost make a balance with 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.760
 the long whenever we think of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.920
 image treatment 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.420
 you have to think about the total image is not 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.850
 true sometimes it's not just about there 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.890
 a tip but how we handle with 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.070
 regarding stature the women of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.800
 short stature first they should not use 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.380
 Very long garments if the long garment is 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.390
 more recommended for people high in 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.890
 reality because tend tends to lower the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.040
 stature that is the visual effect that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.380
 generates is on the other hand 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 in pants the pants is good 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.630
 that are more stylized is good that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.700
 be a little more to the body it's good that 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.950
 out there the skirts are to the knee not 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.530
 below depending on the type of legs 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.850
 They can obviously wear skirts more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 short depending a little on the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.060
 social trends is changing a bit 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.340
 throughout the year but basically 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.870
 we have on the one hand the length of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.910
 skirts and on the other hand the kind of 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.700
 shoes there is something that is classic 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.340
 Basque women 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.140
 is to use platforms the use of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 platforms is quite contradictory 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.009
 because also a person lowers the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.229
 platforms that are very high tend to 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.990
 evidence a complex of that person 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.020
 with respect to the ideal height are tacos 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 that they use their legs and almost like 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 these things that sometimes surely 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 we know some woman who is short and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.299
 you do not really think it's short 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.390
 because its proportions are like divine 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.890
 in itself it is not true that it can be 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.899
 for example a platform but in a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.640
 shoe that has a stylized cue 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.670
 there for night with a platform of two 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.590
 centimeters obviously did not go there 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.380
 the flat shoes in homes of very very 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 low height 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 for example shoes can be tall 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 or even for one says good shoes 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.439
 during the day but I did not notice it during the day 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.939
 good there's first that the question of 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.640
 those of the tacos and the high shoes is 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.140
 an issue basically usual to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.580
 principle may cost a little if not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.709
 they're used to it but afterwards it's something 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 that is perfect and then it is 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.760
 the comfort of the shoe last in 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.830
 let alone find a good supplier of 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.630
 shoes a couple of brands that really 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.970
 have shoes that are comfortable 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.489
 the type of weapons and foot type 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.040
 they are also Chinese taco boots exist 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.930
 with tacos out there a little more square 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.549
 who are like more contemporary not like 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.010
 contacts out there a little more rustic 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.569
 that so not necessarily one has to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.890
 go to work for example your lives 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.799
 hyperactive we have women 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.590
 now the school boys work 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.069
 everything that is as not as if we think 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.799
 to lower it to reality is a little more 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.480
 I say think of tacos that are real not 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.880
 It is true to accompany us to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 the for real life the boots is 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.870
 convenient that the boots that are 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.609
 They are very high up to the knee too 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.330
 they tend to lower their stature and lower 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.450
 the legs 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.940
 and always the ideal is low women 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.310
 They can use black but it's ideal colors 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.500
 and touches that draw attention 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.510
 obviously always depending on the type 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.390
 of paleta each person we remember that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.920
 has a special type of palette and 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.200
 always look for the colors that are 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.810
 compatible with your color palette 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.450
 natural and with which you were born 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.090
 so good a touch of color 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.580
 Presence accessories not too much 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.080
 call attention so much but presence 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.900
 not like a good look and take a 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.670
 same good despite all the parties 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.239
 that we do not like this is the most 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.239
 important
