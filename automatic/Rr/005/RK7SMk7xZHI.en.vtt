pockets<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.980> mean<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:47.430> where<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
pockets I mean that's where all the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.650 
pockets I mean that's where all the
shades<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.670> particular<00:00:50.910> bait<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
shades at for this particular bait you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
shades at for this particular bait you
know<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.160> need

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
know you need to get to where you need

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.650 
know you need to get to where you need
to<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> bait<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.940> fish<00:00:54.270> because

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
to take the bait to the fish because

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
to take the bait to the fish because
they're<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> shallow

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
they're going to be up in the shallow

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.750 
they're going to be up in the shallow
shallow<00:00:56.730> trees<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> conditions

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
shallow trees so you know the conditions

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
shallow trees so you know the conditions
water<00:01:00.000> temperature<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> plays<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
water temperature all that plays a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.770 
water temperature all that plays a
factor<00:01:01.469> wind<00:01:01.980> direction<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> look

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
factor wind direction you want to look

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
factor wind direction you want to look
at<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> stuff<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.159> going

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
at all that stuff because that's going

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.350 
at all that stuff because that's going
to<00:01:05.430> dictate<00:01:05.580> whether<00:01:05.970> they're<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> be

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to dictate whether they're going to be

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
to dictate whether they're going to be
all<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> box<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
all in the box or they can be in the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.719 
all in the box or they can be in the
secondaries<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.610> out

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
secondaries are they're going to be out

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
secondaries are they're going to be out
on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> point<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> has<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> do

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
on the point so a lot of that has to do

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
on the point so a lot of that has to do
with<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.820> making<00:01:11.970> multiple

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
with you know just making multiple

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
with you know just making multiple
presentations<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.530> trying<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> figure<00:01:13.920> out

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
presentations and trying to figure out

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
presentations and trying to figure out
where<00:01:14.340> they're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.700> positioned<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
where they're going to be positioned in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.800 
where they're going to be positioned in
and<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> cover<00:01:17.180> but<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> Sun

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.320 
and around the cover but with the Sun
out<00:01:19.220> there<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.430> than<00:01:20.549> likely<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.299> know
