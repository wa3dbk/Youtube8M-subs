00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.509
 beautiful quiet ratio of my new one 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.170
 video today we came back up here 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.420
 minecraft ps3 just someone webcam 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 because as I said already in the video 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 previous added the program 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.199
 recording ie apache capture la 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.480
 webcam and therefore nothing the video from now on 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.990
 then I think they will be the one with the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.730
 webcam 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 so what will we do today first of all 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 we take off a piece of armor 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.719
 let's do the head this time it's the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.750
 our last armor to enchant 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.460
 before going to the land ha ha ha 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.670
 therefore asking for a pope procession of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.129

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.700
 which is called the brick of the underworld lo 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.040
 I have to take the brick the underworld 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.640
 because I want to make the room 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 scale that they are made 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.820

 I was expecting all this success 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.270

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.270

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.480

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.640
 of the potions because that is excuse away 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.360

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.760

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:42.600
 Of course I'm sure there the paintings 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:47.070

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.730

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.750

 potions house that is our il 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:33.199
 our how to say is understood I understood 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:36.229
 that this is the substance of emotions 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.660
 and now we will go immediately to test if 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.130
 it works here I tried you will have it inside a 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.300
 eye, however , nothing goes because I have 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.010
 discovered that according to the bottles yes 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.699
 because if i have that i'm stupid not 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.380
 I don't know anything about the truest potions 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.090
 that is, I think I understand now too 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:02.060
 if I haven't seen anything 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.860
 I do so I come here I do so here 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.360
 I don't know so it's just random to put 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:14.969
 inside I put right in this then 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:18.779
 I don't know maybe about going 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:21.389
 and so then good things at random guys 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.489
 what do you want right now? 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.059
 fills up let's see if it works and 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:29.659
 no effect 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.659
 no effect 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.910
