00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
nerfed as bad as people are saying if

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.320 
nerfed as bad as people are saying if
you're<00:00:16.170> using<00:00:16.440> bad<00:00:17.250> gear<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.060> are

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you're using bad gear and you are

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660 
you're using bad gear and you are
needing<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> salt<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.350> he'll<00:00:19.590> yes<00:00:20.189> maybe

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
needing the salt but he'll yes maybe

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
needing the salt but he'll yes maybe
then<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.480> won't<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.840> possible<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
then it won't be possible to do for you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
then it won't be possible to do for you
but<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.789> full<00:00:24.029> virtus<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.630> maybe

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
but if you have full virtus or maybe

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
but if you have full virtus or maybe
subjugation<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.369> as<00:00:26.820> easy<00:00:27.090> as

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
subjugation this will do just as easy as

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
subjugation this will do just as easy as
before<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.529> only<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:29.519> at

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
before the only thing is that well at

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.980 
before the only thing is that well at
least<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.119> notice<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
least that I can notice is that the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
least that I can notice is that the
Ranger<00:00:31.500> isn't<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.369> towards<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.149> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Ranger isn't going towards you so that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.549 
Ranger isn't going towards you so that
means<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.600> won't<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> hills<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.350> him

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
means they won't get the hills from him

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
means they won't get the hills from him

is<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.950> most<00:00:50.430> kills<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> one

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is for that I most kills he is the one

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
is for that I most kills he is the one
that's<00:00:52.140> wandered<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.160> too<00:00:53.520> far

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that's wandered off and he's too far

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760 
that's wandered off and he's too far
away<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.300> brush<00:00:54.570> region<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> end

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
away for your brush region so at the end

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
away for your brush region so at the end
of<00:00:55.920> each<00:00:56.070> kill<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.180> kill

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of each kill you have to go and kill

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
of each kill you have to go and kill
them<00:00:57.510> manually<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.590> Titan<00:00:58.859> helps

list<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:10.200> simply<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.820> like<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
list and it's simply because like you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
list and it's simply because like you
eliminate<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> spawn<00:01:12.810> time<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
eliminate to spawn time which is what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.170 
eliminate to spawn time which is what
makes<00:01:13.740> Scott<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.159> mentioned<00:01:14.549> fat<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.939> pain
