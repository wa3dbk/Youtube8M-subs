arch<00:00:09.990> top<00:00:10.260> guitar<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.549> finish<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.150> plate

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
arch top guitar now we finish the plate

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.390 
arch top guitar now we finish the plate
cut<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> F<00:00:12.959> holes<00:00:13.199> and<00:00:13.500> we've<00:00:13.740> trimmed<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
cut the F holes and we've trimmed the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.160 
cut the F holes and we've trimmed the
plate<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:14.879> correct<00:00:15.240> thickness<00:00:15.539> in<00:00:15.959> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
plate to the correct thickness in the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.529 
plate to the correct thickness in the
center<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.830> edges<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.359> blew<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
center and on the edges I blew the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.350 
center and on the edges I blew the
braces<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.289> an<00:00:19.380> X<00:00:19.680> pattern<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.460> they're

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
braces on in an X pattern and they're

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.920 
braces on in an X pattern and they're
oversized<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> will<00:00:23.280> be<00:00:23.400> trimming<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
oversized so we will be trimming them to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.800 
oversized so we will be trimming them to
get<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> best<00:00:25.440> sound<00:00:25.740> out<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.190> top<00:00:26.810> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
get the best sound out of the top the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.560 
get the best sound out of the top the
right<00:00:28.110> thickness<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.940> measure<00:00:30.270> at

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
right thickness here we will measure at

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
right thickness here we will measure at
the<00:00:30.720> X<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.530> nine<00:00:31.800> sixteenths<00:00:32.699> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the X and it will be nine sixteenths and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.510 
the X and it will be nine sixteenths and
then<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.629> brace<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.320> taper<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.190> almost

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
then the brace will taper to almost

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.110 
then the brace will taper to almost
nothing

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
nothing

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.669 
nothing
at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.960> tips<00:00:37.519> will<00:00:38.519> be<00:00:38.550> tapping<00:00:39.269> to<00:00:39.679> ascertain

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
at the tips will be tapping to ascertain

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.639 
at the tips will be tapping to ascertain
how<00:00:40.920> thick<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.339> make<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.789> braces<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> may

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
how thick to make the braces you may

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.169 
how thick to make the braces you may
need<00:00:43.800> headphones<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> listen<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.850> part

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
need headphones to listen to this part

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.910 
need headphones to listen to this part
but<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.479> the<00:00:45.629> only<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.409> is<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
but are the only way to do this is the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.540 
but are the only way to do this is the
sound<00:00:47.249> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> top<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.059> listen<00:00:48.359> carefully

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.549 

you<00:00:53.550> hear<00:00:53.729> that<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.030> brighter<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:55.139> thinner

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you hear that it's brighter and thinner

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
you hear that it's brighter and thinner
right<00:00:55.799> here<00:00:56.249> so<00:00:56.609> I'll<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.819> shaving<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.659> brace

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
right here so I'll be shaving this brace

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.180 
right here so I'll be shaving this brace
until<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.889> tone<00:00:59.190> to<00:01:00.089> sound<00:01:00.389> like<00:01:00.569> this

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
until I get this tone to sound like this

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
until I get this tone to sound like this
spruce<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.459> a<00:01:02.489> material<00:01:03.149> transmits<00:01:04.140> vibration

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
spruce as a material transmits vibration

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
spruce as a material transmits vibration
this<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.760> ten<00:01:06.690> times<00:01:07.080> faster<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.490> way

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this way ten times faster than this way

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
this way ten times faster than this way
this<00:01:09.539> is<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> braces<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.710> arch

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
this is what the braces do in an arch

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
this is what the braces do in an arch
top<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.000> braces<00:01:12.630> as

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
top they're not really so much braces as

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.679 
top they're not really so much braces as
their<00:01:13.289> tone<00:01:13.619> bars<00:01:14.039> and<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.479> trying

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
their tone bars and so what we're trying

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.249 
their tone bars and so what we're trying
to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.079> is<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.360> sound<00:01:18.719> slowed

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to do now is make the the sound slowed

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
to do now is make the the sound slowed
down<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.859> bit<00:01:20.039> this<00:01:20.250> way<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.789> spread

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
down a little bit this way and spread

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
down a little bit this way and spread
the<00:01:22.079> sound<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.530> way<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:23.789> other<00:01:23.909> thing<00:01:24.149> I've

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the sound this way the other thing I've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
the sound this way the other thing I've
noticed<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.109> fine<00:01:25.439> sound<00:01:25.829> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
noticed about the really fine sound and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.730 
noticed about the really fine sound and
Angelico's<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.969> I've<00:01:27.119> worked<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.109> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
Angelico's that I've worked on is that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
Angelico's that I've worked on is that
you<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.609> mark<00:01:29.880> where<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> bridge<00:01:30.450> goes

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you have to mark where the bridge goes

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
you have to mark where the bridge goes
this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.799> bridge<00:01:32.100> line<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> long<00:01:32.759> scale

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this is the bridge line on a long scale

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.740 
this is the bridge line on a long scale
guitar<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> 11<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> 3/8<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.579> top<00:01:35.789> I've

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
guitar it's 11 and 3/8 from the top I've

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.349 
guitar it's 11 and 3/8 from the top I've
noticed<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.469> he<00:01:37.740> leaves<00:01:38.429> d'angelico<00:01:39.090> left

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
noticed that he leaves d'angelico left

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.080 
noticed that he leaves d'angelico left
the<00:01:39.450> brace<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.710> pretty<00:01:40.729> large

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the brace is pretty large

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
the brace is pretty large
up<00:01:42.450> until<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.979> he<00:01:44.399> started<00:01:44.820> his

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
up until that point then he started his

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.419 
up until that point then he started his
taper<00:01:45.240> down<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.899> paper-thin<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> end<00:01:46.859> so

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
taper down to paper-thin at the end so

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.429 
taper down to paper-thin at the end so
I'm<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> leave<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:48.090> strong<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.350> I'm

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I'm going to leave these strong and I'm

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
I'm going to leave these strong and I'm
just<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.740> keep<00:01:49.890> tapering<00:01:50.399> these<00:01:50.609> legs

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
just going to keep tapering these legs

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.789 
just going to keep tapering these legs
to<00:01:50.999> try<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> whole<00:01:51.719> top<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.350> resonate

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to try to get the whole top to resonate

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.709 
to try to get the whole top to resonate
a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.189> better<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> tools

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
a little bit better these are the tools

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.260 
a little bit better these are the tools
you'll<00:01:54.960> need<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.530> carving<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.609> braces<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you'll need for carving the braces a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
you'll need for carving the braces a
little<00:01:58.020> round<00:01:58.200> bottom<00:01:58.409> plain<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.460> you've

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

six inch ruler and a sanding block to
sand<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> X<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> grain<00:02:04.829> goes<00:02:05.009> two

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
sand the X because the grain goes two

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.490 
sand the X because the grain goes two
ways<00:02:05.429> just<00:02:05.700> tear<00:02:05.999> it<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.179> with<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.359> plain

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
ways just tear it out with a plain

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.260 
ways just tear it out with a plain
final<00:02:09.500> measurement<00:02:10.100> in<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.369> center<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.120> X

final measurement in the center of the X

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.530 
final measurement in the center of the X
is<00:02:11.660> 916<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.950> make<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.340> easier<00:02:13.940> keeps

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.920 

now<00:02:34.580> we've<00:02:34.819> trimmed<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> braces<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> little

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
now we've trimmed the braces a little

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
now we've trimmed the braces a little
bit<00:02:36.080> both<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> ends<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> belt<00:02:37.430> sander

bit both the ends and the belt sander

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970 
bit both the ends and the belt sander
did<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> center<00:02:38.450> X<00:02:38.600> will<00:02:39.230> show<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.530> how<00:02:39.770> much

the sound at the top has changed it's
got<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.600> little<00:02:56.810> bit<00:02:57.020> fuller<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:58.250> little<00:02:58.550> bit

got a little bit fuller and a little bit
richer<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.720> how<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> know<00:03:06.110> where<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
richer this is how I know where on the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.880 
richer this is how I know where on the
brace<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:08.090> carve<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:09.500> tap<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:11.500> nice<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.530> fat

brace to carve we tap it nice and fat
here<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:14.180> here<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.170> can<00:03:15.290> see<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> grain<00:03:15.980> runs

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
here in here you can see the grain runs

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.120 
here in here you can see the grain runs
like<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.900> tight<00:03:18.260> spot<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.709> right<00:03:18.860> here

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
like this the tight spot is right here

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.940 
like this the tight spot is right here
grain<00:03:19.730> runs<00:03:20.060> right<00:03:21.050> down<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.590> part<00:03:21.920> of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
grain runs right down to this part of

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.740 
grain runs right down to this part of
the<00:03:22.069> brace<00:03:22.250> I'm<00:03:22.519> going<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.760> shave<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.450> part

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the brace I'm going to shave this part

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:43.150 
the brace I'm going to shave this part
of<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.870> brace<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.780> side<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.500> doing<00:03:42.829> it<00:03:42.980> so

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
of the brace this side to is doing it so

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:52.770 
of the brace this side to is doing it so
I'm<00:03:43.579> going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.820> shave<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.239> part<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.630> leg

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.560 

now<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.840> head<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.040> guitar<00:03:55.329> plate<00:03:56.329> is

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
now the head of the guitar plate is

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.360 
now the head of the guitar plate is
always<00:03:56.870> brighter<00:03:57.320> than<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.769> bottom<00:03:58.160> because

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
always brighter than the bottom because

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.759 
always brighter than the bottom because
this<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:58.640> longer<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.269> it's<00:03:59.360> looser<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.019> if<00:04:00.320> you

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
this is longer and it's looser so if you

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.660 
this is longer and it's looser so if you
compare<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.400> two<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:05.829> can<00:04:06.829> hear<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.459> this

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
compare the two you can hear that this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.610 
compare the two you can hear that this
one<00:04:08.000> needs<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.870> thinned<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.230> little<00:04:09.440> more

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
one needs to be thinned a little more

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.130 
one needs to be thinned a little more
same<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.459> side

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.469 

that<00:04:15.140> one's<00:04:15.260> actually<00:04:15.530> pretty<00:04:15.709> close<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:17.390> I'm

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
that one's actually pretty close so I'm

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.980 
that one's actually pretty close so I'm
just<00:04:17.600> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.810> work<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> cutaway<00:04:22.990> little

just going to work on the cutaway little

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.539 
just going to work on the cutaway little
bit<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.200> fine-tuning<00:04:24.800> on<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.010> cutaway<00:04:25.370> bar

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:31.549 

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:34.159 

it<00:04:32.549> seems<00:04:32.879> to<00:04:33.029> be<00:04:33.119> tighter<00:04:33.389> right<00:04:33.689> here<00:04:33.959> let's
