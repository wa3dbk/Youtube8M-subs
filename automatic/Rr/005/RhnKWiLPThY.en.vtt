a<00:02:58.829> plane<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.459> says<00:02:59.670> four<00:02:59.849> planes<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.510> guess<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
a plane it says four planes I guess I

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.440 
a plane it says four planes I guess I
don't<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.799> gonna<00:03:01.920> use<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.400> though<00:03:02.549> it

don't know I'm gonna use it though it
should<00:03:03.720> work<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:03.959> fine

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
should work just fine

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
assembling the mass I just got things

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.539 
assembling the mass I just got things
hanging<00:03:12.359> in<00:03:12.540> there<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.379> just<00:03:14.189> want<00:03:14.519> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
get a good general look at the idea I'm

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.750 
get a good general look at the idea I'm
gonna<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.549> start<00:03:17.819> with<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> string<00:03:19.189> next<00:03:20.189> and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
gonna be start with the string next and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.220 
gonna be start with the string next and
of<00:03:21.209> course<00:03:21.480> iw<00:03:22.129> epoxy<00:03:23.129> this<00:03:23.280> end<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.639> all

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
of course iw epoxy this end this is all

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.710 
of course iw epoxy this end this is all
together<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.609> go<00:03:26.819> boers<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.359> glued<00:03:27.569> it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
together now you go boers and glued it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.349
