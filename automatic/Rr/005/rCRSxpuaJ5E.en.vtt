going to unbolt this and let it go down
to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.990> ground<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.320> can't<00:00:34.470> be<00:00:34.530> no<00:00:34.590> pressure

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to the ground there can't be no pressure

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
to the ground there can't be no pressure
on<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.310> yeah<00:00:36.240> they're<00:00:36.450> loading<00:00:36.810> right<00:00:37.110> now

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
on there yeah they're loading right now

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.600 
on there yeah they're loading right now
it's<00:00:37.470> extending<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.070> way<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.400> on<00:00:38.580> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
it's extending all the way down on the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
it's extending all the way down on the
extension<00:00:39.180> stop<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.660> still<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:39.990> pressure

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
extension stop it's still got pressure

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.890 
extension stop it's still got pressure
on<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.860> okay<00:00:41.250> they're<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.000> dangerous<00:00:42.690> point

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
on so okay they're at a dangerous point

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.840 
on so okay they're at a dangerous point
here<00:00:43.230> okay<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.400> we're<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.700> going

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
here okay well because we're not going

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.460 
here okay well because we're not going
to<00:00:44.970> reuse<00:00:45.060> everything<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.810> guess<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> let's<00:00:46.350> go

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
to reuse everything I guess all let's go

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.510 
to reuse everything I guess all let's go
ahead<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> cut<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.040> off<00:00:47.130> with<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.370> die

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
ahead and cut them off with a die

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
ahead and cut them off with a die
grinder<00:00:47.840> because<00:00:48.840> we're<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> reuse

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
grinder because we're not going to reuse

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
grinder because we're not going to reuse
any<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> suspension<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.030> take

any of the suspension you know take

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:06.620 
any of the suspension you know take
tension<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.690> okay<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.860> do

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 

well<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> mean<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.440> knew<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.710> had<00:01:07.830> pressure<00:01:08.159> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
well I mean I knew they had pressure on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
well I mean I knew they had pressure on
him<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.760> didn't<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.240> didn't<00:01:09.659> figure<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> was

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
him I just didn't I didn't figure it was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:37.690 
him I just didn't I didn't figure it was
easy<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.440> much

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.560 

that's<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> way<00:01:38.970> everything<00:01:39.240> should<00:01:39.540> come

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that's the way everything should come

00:01:39.570 --> 00:02:00.610 
that's the way everything should come
