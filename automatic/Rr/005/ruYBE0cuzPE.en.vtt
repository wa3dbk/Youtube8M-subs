00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.299
 inner corner of our eyes 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.160

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.240
 more darker more brighter and I will 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.850

 did not happen and neatly 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 decision 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 I will not take the brush actively take e21 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.790
 purple dark purple shade and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.770
 I will display 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.480
 such a similarity to the arrow on the purple 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.540
 so kind 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.760
 I will apply the same shade on the bottom 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.319

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.120
 and I will use this one 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.120
 I am light pink 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.620
 I will apply the same shade and a zone under 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.620
 eyebrow 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:23.639
 Now I take the brush for feathering and E36 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:26.160
 and ruined our borders laid to 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.870
 draw the line of growth of our eyelashes you 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.700
 can use any product 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.250
 who you like it maybe 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.310
 gel liner it can be liquid 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.560
 eyeliner and I will use the usual 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.380
 black matte shadows and such 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.300

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.130
 teach 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.440
 wet with a wet wipe and 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.370
 then I will pick up the shadows and carry out 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.240
 I don't want a little arrow 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.440
 think thick and now I try to do 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.630
 minimal thin line 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.150
 if you become a make-up motive 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.530
 display an arrow then it is possible 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.570
 file along with a purple shade with 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.290
 the flood we finished now move on to 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.680

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.680
 I will not use google water adsense 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.750

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.830
 the wish can be painted over and lower 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.830
 eyelashes 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.440
