the next column be 15k card because
adding<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.879> for<00:03:37.090> chaotic<00:03:37.419> most<00:03:37.599> only<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.900> gotta

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
adding a for chaotic most only you gotta

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.289 
adding a for chaotic most only you gotta
boost<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> next<00:03:38.980> magic<00:03:39.250> number<00:03:39.549> which

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
is of course 15k but so this can gives

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.420 
is of course 15k but so this can gives
more<00:03:42.819> pressure<00:03:43.060> than<00:03:43.239> ever<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:45.099> yeah<00:03:45.250> you're
