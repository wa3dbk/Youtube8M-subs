 even sharing the local song not me 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.450

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.450

 hotel pecs cury da kingston font 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.810
 if the sony 15 20h the executive with the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.510
 old still wants to change 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.210

 Tomorrow is the gigabyte gb to 970 s 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:54.650
 3 For one thing I thought I lacked in this 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.370
 plant should have come more sapa cables 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.370
 go up 2 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.300
 I think the next two should come 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.960
 so that the notch facing 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.990
 down because you put down and 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.930
 the sides of the car that is 90 degrees below 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.890
 so we made it easier to save a car 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.890
 this way, only one side 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.970
 It's not there, the suggestion is by whom. 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.280

00:05:50.860 --> 00:06:00.450

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.400
