00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.250
 we go 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:45.720
 are the arthropods are the animals more 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.420
 numerous and we can find them in the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.360
 soil water and also in the air 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.400
 because many can fly all the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280
 arthropods are oviparous and have the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.900
 body covered by an external skeleton 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 formed by several joined pieces that 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.379
 they can be bent ie is articulated 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.010
 within the arthropods we distinguish 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.460
 four groups the insects the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.850
 crustaceans the arachnids and the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850
 myriapods 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.909
 are the insects 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:28.120
 almost all the arthropods that exist 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.050
 they are katyn insects this bee 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:36.250
 your body is divided into head has 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:41.110
 the mouth the eyes and the two thorax antennas 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.720
 in you the legs come out in this case 6 the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 insects have six legs and many like 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.530
 the bee also have wings and the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.310
 abdomen 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 He has many organs of his body 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.650
 insects are bones and stoppages do not leave the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.560
 egg resemble a worm and they are 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.020
 called caterpillars with the passage of time the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.550
 caterpillar is transformed ingrid exit and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.940
 after an adult this process is called 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.770
 metamorphosis some insects are the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.170
 butterflies the beetles the a for 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.170
 mountains or edges 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.450
 here are the funny the museums are 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 animals that have 10 or more robes and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.130
 many as the prawns have antennas 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.560
 long crustaceans today 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 submarines some examples of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 crustaceans are shrimp crabs or 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.390
 the mongoose 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 are not the senses the arachnids of 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.310
 eight legs and lack antennas that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.310
 all arachnids are terrestrial 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.040
 there are arachnid species that are very 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.459
 dangerous due to its lethal sting 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.840
 like the black widow a kind of spider 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.500
 another example of arachnids are the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.500
 scorpions 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:25.109
 all all have the elongated body and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.349
 divided into many segments of those that 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.769
 out legs and antennae more when 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.659
 will be in charge and dangerous in the feet 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.659
 they are animals lilia pÃ©rez 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.129
 where the two live 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.810
 the arthropods are the group of animals 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.180
 more numerous due to its great diversity 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.840
 we can find arthropods in all 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.910
 the places in the mountains the forests 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:03.020
 in the bushes the rivers the lakes the 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.510
 seas and even in our homes well 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.980
 that there are some living arthropods 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.490
 in places where it is very difficult 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.990
 survive employment many scorpions 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.990
 they live in the desert 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.030
 how the transfers live 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.000
 Arthropods eat vegetables 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.520
 or of conscious animals the spiders are 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.660
 loaders the crabs are usually 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.850
 live and the beans are herbivores the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.000
 arthropods breathe very 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.490
 different for example the crabs 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.950
 they have farms the spiders have 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.590
 special lungs insects 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.950
 they breathe for suits that are about 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.110
 small tubes that there are in your abdomen the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.660
 most arthropods move 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.480
 walking though some fly like the 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.070
 many aquatic arthropod insects 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.260
 they can swim 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.230
 all arthropods are animals 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.140
 oviparous eggs hatch larvae that 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.640
 they undergo metamorphosis that is many 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.560
 successive changes until it 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.560
 they turn into adult arthropods
