00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Mr. Luis Alfonso Pulido will speak to us 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 in this moment of equestrian jump that is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.820
 another one of those disciplines where the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.820
 horse really is an athlete 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 The sport of jumping consists of 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.930
 in having a horse suitable for 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 practice sports 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.470
 obviously he has a previous training 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.809
 you always have to train both the rider 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.629
 like the horse to be able to practice 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.410
 sport to the horse you have to teach 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.899
 jump to the rider who teach him to jump 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.910
 then always always like everything 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.470
 sport is a discipline 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.979
 we have to be training daily 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.949
 to be able to compete at the level 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.299
 national departmental 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.059
 internationally 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.360
 one as a rider gives some orders to 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.300
 horse to make the jump all to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.119
 drive base this drive the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.369
 we perform with the legs and the rider 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.009
 obviously you should help a little 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.710
 horse always trying to give him a good 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.850
 approach to the obstacle 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 Rider training is first that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.740
 all true discipline that's a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.440
 training that should be practiced 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.539
 diary because currently of all 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.630
 ways the sport has its risk 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.300
 true then a rider should every time 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.820
 adapt more to be able to have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.600
 safety on the horse catch the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.920
 Balance 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:50.140
 balance to be well centered 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.520
 on the horse and adapting each 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.680
 more time to him riding and sports 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 of the jump we have that it's all a style 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.100
 of life is a passion that requires a lot 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.920
 dedication and a lot of effort 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.600
 as he was with animals that also 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.310
 they have their own state of mind is very 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.709
 important one how to make a create a 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.020
 binomial that is the set of the horse and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.380
 the rider and train hard with 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.260
 clear objectives to achieve the goals 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.620
 more than a sport is it teaches many 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.290
 things about everything 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.299
 as discipline is telling you 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 responsibility and many other things 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.290
 what 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 or be important in life suddenly 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.800
 in other areas it helps with values ​​that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.600
 later on they can be useful in 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.390
 other areas of life but also 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.160
 all the horse 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.260
 is almost the same as the same training 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 is done with the rider is true because 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.730
 equal to the horse that to teach him one he took 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.760
 a young three-year-old horse you have to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.610
 teach him to jump you have to give him the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920
 idea of ​​how it is that you skip what 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.560
 Must do 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.080
 and daily to give them repetitions and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.780
 repetitions good the risks is 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 that often happens when the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.930
 horse rider 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.530
 it's not very practical and the horse either 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.140
 he has a lot of experience 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.000
 it could happen many times horse 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.490
 rider comes with his horse to jump and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.760
 can stop at the front the jump one will 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.500
 it can fall hit against the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.300
 obstacles and the risk is quite 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.840
 great for me is a sport like there is 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.840
 a lot of passion 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.239
 the science action that feels after 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.799
 for me almost that purely adrenaline 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.379
 satisfaction for everything as what for 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.290
 example in the practices is done and that 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.150
 one I have already reflected here and that is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.519
 as good results 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.860
 let's say that for one it is already a sensation 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.569
 quite normal because because I 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.379
 I practice this sport since from very 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.329
 small then surely I would 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.849
 I agree the first jump I made if 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.190
 I felt that I threw myself like to the 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.250
 but some vacuum but as no 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.310
 learning the technical gesture and all that 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.850
 because it rises not losing the emotion 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.030
 because because I believe that if one loses 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.740
 the emotion because it does not make sense 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.080
 ride on a horse but that 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.360
 feeling that all the people are 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.300
 imagine that you believe that you do so when 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.100
 jumps not one feels another kind of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.540
 feeling like pleasure over feels 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.940
 when the technical gesture of the horse is 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.250
 nice when treads force 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.170
 employs safely with good technique 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.780
 those are the sensations that one already 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.550
 as a rider he likes to feel the sport 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.200
 as such it is a sport 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.680
 quite important for people 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.510
 because this sport starts to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.960
 practice from 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:09.300
 from 3 or 4 years where the riders 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.940
 they are formed not only as riders but 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.950
 as people also because they are 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.450
 daily interacting with one another 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.450
 be alive then 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.669
 for a pretty pretty person 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.129
 important enough to be in 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.899
 this world of equestrian sports because 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.899
 It is very very formative
