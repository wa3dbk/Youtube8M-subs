that's<00:00:40.540> basically<00:00:40.990> it<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.850> just<00:00:43.060> gonna

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's basically it so I'm just gonna

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160 
that's basically it so I'm just gonna
wet<00:00:45.010> my<00:00:45.190> hair<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.970> it's<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.750> reason<00:00:46.900> why<00:00:47.140> I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
wet my hair and it's the reason why I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.060

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
choose to do that is because it it's

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.570 
choose to do that is because it it's
pretty<00:00:51.340> much<00:00:51.480> manageable<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.630> way<00:00:53.310> as<00:00:54.310> I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
pretty much manageable that way as I

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.520 
pretty much manageable that way as I
said<00:00:54.820> before<00:00:55.060> I'm<00:00:55.570> getting<00:00:55.840> ready<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.170> wash<00:00:56.320> my

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
I do it that way but I found out that

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.440 
I do it that way but I found out that

and<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.610> I'm<00:02:04.760> rushing<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.420> back<00:02:05.600> I'm<00:02:05.810> holding

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
and as I'm rushing it back I'm holding

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.230 
and as I'm rushing it back I'm holding
it<00:02:06.470> right<00:02:06.620> here<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:10.130> I'm<00:02:10.310> just<00:02:10.520> using<00:02:10.700> us<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
it right here and I'm just using us a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.130 
it right here and I'm just using us a
simple<00:02:11.960> scrunchie<00:02:12.880> no<00:02:13.880> metal<00:02:14.420> band<00:02:14.720> or

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
simple scrunchie no metal band or

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.590 
simple scrunchie no metal band or
anything<00:02:15.410> like<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:16.600> hopefully

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
anything like that in there hopefully

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.940 
anything like that in there hopefully
it's<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.020> hold<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.380> one<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> can

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
it's going to hold it but this one I can

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.500 
it's going to hold it but this one I can
probably<00:02:22.190> only<00:02:22.550> get<00:02:22.790> around<00:02:23.090> twice<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:26.270> other

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
probably only get around twice the other

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.560 
probably only get around twice the other
ones<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.020> pretty<00:02:27.200> much<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> around

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
ones I can pretty much get it around

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.670 
ones I can pretty much get it around
three<00:02:29.900> times<00:02:30.970> okay

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
three times okay

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.820 
three times okay
so<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:36.020> really<00:02:36.470> all<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:38.230> straight<00:02:39.230> so

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
so it's not really all that straight so

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.170 
so it's not really all that straight so
I'm<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.280> take<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.459> brush<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.060> go

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
I'm going to just take my brush and go

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.600 
I'm going to just take my brush and go
over<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.830> doesn't<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.280> matter

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
over it and it doesn't really matter

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670 
over it and it doesn't really matter
because<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.480> place<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.870> bobby<00:02:45.080> pins<00:02:45.470> in

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
because as you place your bobby pins in

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.870 
because as you place your bobby pins in
there<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.940> get<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:47.570> however<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.200> like

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
there you can get it on however you like

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.360 
there you can get it on however you like
so<00:02:49.880> what<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:52.239> take<00:02:53.239> my<00:02:53.300> hair<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:55.010> flip

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
so what I do I take my hair and I flip

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.199 
so what I do I take my hair and I flip
it<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.700> way<00:02:56.050> okay<00:02:57.050> now<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:58.520> flip<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> up

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
it this way okay now just flip it up

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.729 
it this way okay now just flip it up
work<00:03:00.010> hopefully<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.580> see<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.739> just

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
work hopefully you can see this just

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.789 
work hopefully you can see this just
like<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.810> now<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.140> lot<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.680> are
