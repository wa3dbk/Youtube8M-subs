tips for table design and building your
own<00:00:07.049> table<00:00:07.560> will<00:00:08.069> hopefully<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.550> some<00:00:08.730> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
own table will hopefully have some of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.180 
own table will hopefully have some of
the<00:00:08.910> materials<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.450> support<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.740> detail

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
little video tutorial on some tips that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.129 
little video tutorial on some tips that
I've<00:00:14.969> picked<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:15.570> building<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> whole

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
I've picked up from building a whole

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.939 
I've picked up from building a whole
bunch<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> tables<00:00:17.210> when<00:00:18.210> building<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.630> table

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
bunch of tables when building a table

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
bunch of tables when building a table
the<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.340> most<00:00:20.520> important<00:00:21.060> thing<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> we

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the the most important thing is that we

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
the the most important thing is that we
can<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> reliable<00:00:22.470> flat<00:00:22.800> surface<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> lay

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
can get a reliable flat surface to lay

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.179 
can get a reliable flat surface to lay
your<00:00:23.820> pitch<00:00:24.060> down<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.529> material<00:00:26.070> that

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
your pitch down on and the material that

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.220 
your pitch down on and the material that
I<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.670> pretty<00:00:26.880> much<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.539> time<00:00:27.570> right<00:00:28.050> now

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
I use pretty much all the time right now

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
I use pretty much all the time right now
is<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.680> called<00:00:28.980> medium<00:00:29.429> density<00:00:29.910> fiberboard

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
is one called medium density fiberboard

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.299 
is one called medium density fiberboard
or<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.859> short<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.309> known<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.700> MDF<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> can

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
or for short it's known as MDF you can

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.590 
or for short it's known as MDF you can
get<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.850> Lowe's<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.710> at<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.980> local<00:00:38.600> or

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
get that at Lowe's or at your local or

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
get that at Lowe's or at your local or
whatever<00:00:39.899> local<00:00:40.230> hardware<00:00:40.530> store<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
whatever local hardware store that you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
whatever local hardware store that you
have<00:00:41.309> home<00:00:41.700> depot<00:00:42.059> etc<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.320> thickness<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
have home depot etc the thickness that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
have home depot etc the thickness that
I'm<00:00:44.040> using<00:00:44.489> pretty<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> three

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I'm using pretty much now is a three

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.279 
I'm using pretty much now is a three
quarter<00:00:46.200> inch<00:00:46.370> thickness<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.059> find<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.960> half

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
quarter inch thickness I find that half

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
quarter inch thickness I find that half
an<00:00:49.590> inch<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.129> probably<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.670> away<00:00:50.789> with

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
an inch you can probably get away with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
an inch you can probably get away with
that<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.629> find<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.289> hardware

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that if you can find it in your hardware

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.950 
that if you can find it in your hardware
store<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.550> 3/4<00:00:54.149> inch<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.539> definitely

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
store but 3/4 inch is definitely

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.170 
store but 3/4 inch is definitely
preferable<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.649> gives<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> extra

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
preferable just gives you that extra

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
preferable just gives you that extra
strength<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> again<00:00:57.719> keeps<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> surface

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
strength and again keeps the surface

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.389 
strength and again keeps the surface
nice<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.190> flat<00:01:00.020> MDF<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.100> definitely<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.370> my

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
nice and flat MDF is definitely in my

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.830 
nice and flat MDF is definitely in my
opinion<00:01:02.579> after<00:01:03.090> building<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> number<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
opinion after building a number of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.980 
opinion after building a number of
boards<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:06.000> heavy

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
boards the way to go it is very heavy

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
boards the way to go it is very heavy
that's<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.619> definite<00:01:08.100> drawback<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.970> but

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that's one definite drawback with it but

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
that's one definite drawback with it but
it<00:01:09.570> does<00:01:09.840> resist<00:01:10.409> warping<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it does resist warping and that's it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
it does resist warping and that's it
that's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> key<00:01:12.420> element<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.320> board<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that's a key element for your board if

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
that's a key element for your board if
you<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.159> astro<00:01:14.460> pitch<00:01:14.640> you've<00:01:14.820> spent

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you have an astro pitch you've spent

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.870 
you have an astro pitch you've spent
ninety<00:01:15.990> eight<00:01:16.200> hundred<00:01:16.680> dollars<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> then

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
ninety eight hundred dollars on and then

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
ninety eight hundred dollars on and then
the<00:01:18.030> surface<00:01:18.420> warps<00:01:18.950> you're<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the surface warps you're going to be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.780 
the surface warps you're going to be
pretty<00:01:20.369> upset<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.420> MDF<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pretty upset with that so MDF is is the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
pretty upset with that so MDF is is the
way<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> I've<00:01:24.540> found<00:01:24.810> some<00:01:25.439> people

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
way to go that I've found some people

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
way to go that I've found some people
use<00:01:26.250> chipboard<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> I've<00:01:27.659> heard<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> people

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
use chipboard and I've heard of people

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.850 
use chipboard and I've heard of people
using<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.299> noted<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.590> lot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
using that and I have noted that a lot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
using that and I have noted that a lot
of<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.430> walk<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.659> any

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
of those do walk all the time any

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
of those do walk all the time any
moisture<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:35.070> atmospheric

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
moisture at all even atmospheric

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
moisture at all even atmospheric
moisture<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:37.079> room<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.189> an

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
moisture in a room will will have an

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240 
moisture in a room will will have an
adverse<00:01:38.610> effect<00:01:38.640> over<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.979> what

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
adverse effect over time so this is what

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.330 
adverse effect over time so this is what
I<00:01:41.280> strongly<00:01:41.820> recommend<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
I strongly recommend when you go to the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.050 
I strongly recommend when you go to the
hardware<00:01:44.340> store<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:46.490> recommend<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> get

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hardware store I recommend that you get

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550

54 inches what I did when I went to the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
foot by 4 feet and I had it cut to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.580 
foot by 4 feet and I had it cut to
dimensions<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.299> left<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.810> couple<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.409> inches

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590

on either side of the surface and that's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.030 
on either side of the surface and that's
all<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.480> way<00:02:33.510> around<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.319> warming<00:02:34.829> track

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
all the way around like a warming track

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.679 
all the way around like a warming track
kind<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.400> approach<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
kind of approach here but that is

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.809 
kind of approach here but that is
actually<00:02:36.810> very<00:02:37.019> important<00:02:37.739> for<00:02:37.920> play<00:02:38.159> you

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
actually very important for play you

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.610 
actually very important for play you
want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.390> enough<00:02:39.840> room<00:02:40.079> for<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.349> players

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
to be able to come off you want to give

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.729 
to be able to come off you want to give
you<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.329> hands<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:42.810> position<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.590> can

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
you a hands up position so that they can

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.110 
you a hands up position so that they can
flick<00:02:44.010> with<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.220> figure<00:02:44.519> here<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.879> side

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
flick with the figure here at the side

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.720 
flick with the figure here at the side
and<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.810> found<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.379> allowing<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.159> 2<00:02:47.459> inches

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and I found that allowing is 2 inches

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.399 
and I found that allowing is 2 inches
around<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.870> entire<00:02:49.230> surface<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.129> optimum

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
around the entire surface is the optimum

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.509 
around the entire surface is the optimum
situation<00:02:52.409> for<00:02:53.099> playing<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.489> game

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
situation for playing the game

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.449 
situation for playing the game
effectively<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:55.980> board<00:02:56.250> for

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
effectively so for this board for

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.190 
effectively so for this board for
example<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.150> had<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.750> MDF<00:02:58.290> cut<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.420> 58<00:03:00.420> inches<00:03:01.019> I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
example I had the MDF cut to 58 inches I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.649 
example I had the MDF cut to 58 inches I
believe<00:03:01.530> by<00:03:01.829> 40<00:03:02.459> inches<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.329> allowed

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
believe by 40 inches and that allowed

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.110 
believe by 40 inches and that allowed
for<00:03:03.840> these<00:03:04.019> two<00:03:04.319> inches<00:03:04.799> around<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.659> board

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
for these two inches around for my board

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.210 
for these two inches around for my board
once<00:03:09.120> I'd<00:03:09.420> had<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.870> cut<00:03:10.319> by<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> way<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.980> red

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220

wider<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:40.169> higher<00:03:40.620> than<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.299> because<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
wider or higher than that because that

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.020 
wider or higher than that because that
can<00:03:42.840> impede<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.889> hand<00:03:44.310> position<00:03:44.489> when

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
can impede your hand position when

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.280 
can impede your hand position when
you're<00:03:45.180> playing<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.659> game<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.109> don't

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
you're playing the game so you don't

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.000 
you're playing the game so you don't
want<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.440> really<00:03:46.769> high<00:03:48.169> surround<00:03:49.169> here<00:03:49.650> because

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
want a really high surround here because

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.069 
want a really high surround here because
it<00:03:50.129> can<00:03:50.280> affect<00:03:50.609> your<00:03:50.729> hand<00:03:51.000> position<00:03:51.180> I've

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
it can affect your hand position I've

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.229 
it can affect your hand position I've
found<00:03:52.379> this<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.620> be<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.919> really<00:03:53.430> good<00:03:53.669> dimension

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
found this to be a really good dimension

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.629 
found this to be a really good dimension
works<00:03:54.510> really<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.199> you<00:03:56.159> might<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.430> able<00:03:56.489> to

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
works really well you might be able to

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.069 
works really well you might be able to
find<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.909> this<00:03:57.120> there's<00:03:57.510> certainly<00:03:57.810> some

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
find you this there's certainly some

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.539 
find you this there's certainly some
flexibility<00:03:58.680> with<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:58.859> that<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.250> could

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
flexibility with that that you could

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.759 
flexibility with that that you could
walk<00:04:00.150> around<00:04:00.299> with<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:01.019> own<00:04:01.169> table<00:04:01.650> and

the pitch we have here a goal area one

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.939 
the pitch we have here a goal area one
critical<00:04:09.209> thing<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.840> you've<00:04:10.440> got<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.799> have

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
critical thing is you've got to have

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.140 
critical thing is you've got to have
enough<00:04:11.280> room<00:04:11.579> for<00:04:13.220> goaltending<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.310> also<00:04:14.699> not

enough room for goaltending and also not

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.699 
enough room for goaltending and also not
hurting<00:04:15.540> your<00:04:15.659> hands<00:04:15.989> if<00:04:16.079> you're<00:04:16.199> moving<00:04:16.409> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
enough area behind the goals what I've

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.219 
enough area behind the goals what I've
done<00:04:20.729> typically<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.329> found<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.719> works<00:04:21.930> best

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
done typically and found that works best

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.580 
done typically and found that works best
is<00:04:22.529> that<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.039> nine<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.760> ten<00:04:24.060> in

is that a nine to ten in

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.370 
is that a nine to ten in
open<00:04:24.980> area<00:04:25.520> here<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:26.300> optimum<00:04:26.900> for<00:04:27.080> being<00:04:27.290> able

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
to do effective goalkeeping and still

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.960 
to do effective goalkeeping and still
allowed<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.919> allow<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.580> keep<00:04:31.790> the

figures on the field as you're playing
the<00:04:33.650> game<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:34.160> couple<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.120> other<00:04:35.270> extra<00:04:35.660> things

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
the game a couple of other extra things

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.560 
the game a couple of other extra things
that<00:04:36.080> I've<00:04:36.200> done<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.680> here<00:04:37.130> on<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.910> side<00:04:38.210> I've

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
that I've done is here on the side I've

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.200 
that I've done is here on the side I've
made<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> little<00:04:39.020> angled<00:04:39.800> cut<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.370> both<00:04:40.820> sides

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
made a little angled cut on both sides

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.510 
made a little angled cut on both sides
and<00:04:41.690> then<00:04:41.990> I've<00:04:42.530> gone<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.040> trouble<00:04:43.070> of

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
and then I've gone to the trouble of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.640 
and then I've gone to the trouble of
actually<00:04:43.639> sanding<00:04:44.450> smoothing<00:04:45.080> this<00:04:45.260> area

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
actually sanding smoothing this area

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.409 
actually sanding smoothing this area
around<00:04:45.889> here<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.460> if<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.669> do<00:04:46.850> jam<00:04:47.210> your

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
around here so that if you do jam your

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.420 
around here so that if you do jam your
hand<00:04:47.630> on<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.020> side<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.919> don't<00:04:49.040> cut<00:04:49.280> yourself

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
hand on the side you don't cut yourself

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.840 
hand on the side you don't cut yourself
or<00:04:49.880> hurt<00:04:50.030> your<00:04:50.240> hand<00:04:50.740> so<00:04:51.740> that's<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.280> couple<00:04:52.700> of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
or hurt your hand so that's a couple of

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.659 
or hurt your hand so that's a couple of
little<00:04:53.000> tips<00:04:53.270> in<00:04:53.480> those<00:04:53.660> areas<00:04:54.340> well<00:04:55.340> I've<00:04:55.460> got

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
little tips in those areas well I've got

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.520 
little tips in those areas well I've got
your<00:04:55.910> attention<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:56.900> wanted<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.290> show<00:04:57.500> you

that's<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.150> couple<00:05:23.780> of<00:05:23.900> tips<00:05:24.139> that<00:05:24.290> I<00:05:24.440> wanted<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
that's a couple of tips that I wanted to

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.560 
that's a couple of tips that I wanted to
share<00:05:25.070> with<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.880> get<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.150> most<00:05:26.330> out<00:05:26.510> of

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
share with you to get the most out of

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.850 
share with you to get the most out of
your<00:05:26.720> ass<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:27.020> pitch<00:05:27.169> if<00:05:27.320> you're<00:05:27.470> building<00:05:27.620> a

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
your ass to pitch if you're building a

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.130 
your ass to pitch if you're building a
board<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.370> guess<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.150> final<00:05:29.390> thing<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.960> could

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
board I guess the final thing I could

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.380 
board I guess the final thing I could
say<00:05:30.350> is<00:05:30.380> that<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.770> support<00:05:31.220> your<00:05:31.430> your<00:05:31.850> surface

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
say is that to support your your surface

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.960 
say is that to support your your surface
you<00:05:33.050> might<00:05:33.229> want<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.530> purchase<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:34.070> table<00:05:34.580> such

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
you might want to purchase a table such

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.790 
you might want to purchase a table such
as<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.270> one<00:05:35.570> I'm<00:05:35.720> showing<00:05:36.110> here<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.590> gray

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
as the one I'm showing here the gray

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.120 
as the one I'm showing here the gray
table<00:05:37.340> these<00:05:38.330> come<00:05:38.600> in<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:38.810> height<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.169> about<00:05:39.350> 34

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
table these come in a height of about 34

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.680 
table these come in a height of about 34
inches<00:05:40.160> or<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:40.760> which<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.120> pretty<00:05:41.360> good<00:05:41.630> for

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
inches or so which is pretty good for

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.330 
inches or so which is pretty good for
playing<00:05:42.140> table<00:05:42.500> soccer<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.039> fairly

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
playing table soccer and fairly

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.490 
playing table soccer and fairly
comfortable<00:05:43.820> height<00:05:44.030> you<00:05:45.020> can<00:05:45.169> get<00:05:45.320> these

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
comfortable height you can get these

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.200 
comfortable height you can get these
from<00:05:45.770> like<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.950> staples<00:05:46.460> or<00:05:46.610> office<00:05:46.640> depot

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
from like a staples or office depot

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.500 
from like a staples or office depot
typically<00:05:48.200> for<00:05:48.380> forty<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:48.830> fifty<00:05:49.160> dollars

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
typically for forty to fifty dollars

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.240 
typically for forty to fifty dollars
another<00:05:50.510> option<00:05:51.020> though<00:05:51.169> might<00:05:51.500> be<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:52.039> go

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
another option though might be to go

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.909 
another option though might be to go
with<00:05:52.550> some<00:05:52.940> sources<00:05:53.630> to<00:05:53.900> support<00:05:54.050> your<00:05:54.410> table

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
with some sources to support your table

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.390 
with some sources to support your table
and<00:05:55.180> here<00:05:56.180> I<00:05:56.210> have<00:05:56.690> a<00:05:56.720> set<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.530> sawhorses<00:05:57.710> that

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
and here I have a set of sawhorses that

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.850 
and here I have a set of sawhorses that
one<00:05:58.880> advantage<00:05:59.270> here<00:05:59.900> is<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.169> they<00:06:00.620> can<00:06:00.830> be

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
one advantage here is that they can be

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.629 
one advantage here is that they can be
set<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.669> go<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.880> little<00:06:02.120> bit<00:06:02.360> higher<00:06:02.660> so<00:06:03.100> 35<00:06:04.100> 36

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
set to go a little bit higher so 35 36

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.570 
set to go a little bit higher so 35 36
inches<00:06:05.200> might<00:06:06.200> be<00:06:06.350> even<00:06:06.410> more<00:06:06.740> comfortable<00:06:07.130> if

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
inches might be even more comfortable if

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.820 
inches might be even more comfortable if
you've<00:06:07.700> got<00:06:07.850> any<00:06:08.630> bank<00:06:08.930> problems<00:06:09.350> or<00:06:09.560> you're

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
you've got any bank problems or you're

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.920 
you've got any bank problems or you're
particularly<00:06:10.370> tall<00:06:10.610> might<00:06:11.570> be<00:06:11.720> good<00:06:11.900> for

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
particularly tall might be good for

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.680 
particularly tall might be good for
playing<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.440> game<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:13.340> can<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:13.760> a<00:06:13.970> set<00:06:14.570> of

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
playing the game you can so a set of

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.510 
playing the game you can so a set of
sawhorses<00:06:14.840> that<00:06:15.350> are<00:06:15.440> adjustable<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:16.160> real

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
sawhorses that are adjustable a real

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.980 
sawhorses that are adjustable a real
good<00:06:16.760> idea<00:06:16.910> of<00:06:17.270> course<00:06:17.510> you<00:06:17.600> get<00:06:17.720> them<00:06:17.870> from

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
good idea of course you get them from

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.230 
good idea of course you get them from
any<00:06:18.139> hardware<00:06:18.590> store<00:06:18.770> I<00:06:19.430> know<00:06:19.910> though<00:06:20.210> that

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
any hardware store I know though that

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.570 
any hardware store I know though that
Sears<00:06:20.780> have<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.169> product<00:06:21.680> that<00:06:21.800> they<00:06:22.010> produce

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
Sears have a product that they produce

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.080 
Sears have a product that they produce
that<00:06:23.060> is<00:06:23.240> a<00:06:23.270> set<00:06:23.990> height<00:06:24.350> of<00:06:24.560> sawhorses<00:06:25.090> that

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
that is a set height of sawhorses that

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.810 
that is a set height of sawhorses that
are<00:06:26.360> that<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.020> can<00:06:27.229> pick<00:06:27.440> up<00:06:27.620> for<00:06:27.889> maybe<00:06:28.340> 20

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
are that you can pick up for maybe 20

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.060 
are that you can pick up for maybe 20
bucks<00:06:28.850> or<00:06:29.240> so<00:06:29.450> for<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.780> pair<00:06:30.050> that<00:06:30.410> are<00:06:30.919> at<00:06:31.039> a

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
bucks or so for a pair that are at a

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.969 
bucks or so for a pair that are at a
height<00:06:31.550> of<00:06:31.760> about<00:06:31.940> 34<00:06:32.630> 35<00:06:33.080> inches<00:06:33.530> so<00:06:33.710> that's<00:06:33.830> a

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
height of about 34 35 inches so that's a

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.800 
height of about 34 35 inches so that's a
pretty<00:06:34.130> good<00:06:34.280> option<00:06:34.580> these<00:06:35.270> might<00:06:35.630> be<00:06:35.780> a

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
pretty good option these might be a

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.950 
pretty good option these might be a
little<00:06:35.870> bit<00:06:36.289> more

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
little bit more

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.930 
little bit more
but<00:06:37.620> that<00:06:37.740> adjustable<00:06:38.280> feature<00:06:38.520> is<00:06:38.669> a<00:06:38.729> good

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
but that adjustable feature is a good

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.550 
but that adjustable feature is a good
thing<00:06:39.180> but<00:06:39.630> these<00:06:39.810> are<00:06:39.990> a<00:06:40.020> couple<00:06:40.319> of<00:06:40.410> options

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
thing but these are a couple of options

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.650 
thing but these are a couple of options
for<00:06:40.919> supporting<00:06:41.460> your<00:06:41.580> table<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.030> sawhorses

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
for supporting your table the sawhorses

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.890 
for supporting your table the sawhorses
or<00:06:43.100> we<00:06:44.100> could<00:06:44.340> use<00:06:44.550> like<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:45.000> staples<00:06:45.720> type

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
or we could use like the staples type

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.740 
or we could use like the staples type
grade<00:06:46.169> table<00:06:46.590> over<00:06:46.889> here<00:06:47.479> okay<00:06:48.479> I<00:06:48.630> think

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
grade table over here okay I think

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.300 
grade table over here okay I think
that'll<00:06:49.139> do<00:06:49.259> it<00:06:49.380> for<00:06:49.560> now<00:06:49.680> hopefully<00:06:50.160> we'll

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
that'll do it for now hopefully we'll

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.719 
that'll do it for now hopefully we'll
have<00:06:50.430> some<00:06:50.759> more<00:06:50.970> products<00:06:52.310> to<00:06:53.310> talk<00:06:53.550> about

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
have some more products to talk about

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.589 
have some more products to talk about
and<00:06:53.970> support<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.979> table<00:06:55.979> building<00:06:56.599> questions

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
and support the table building questions

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.270 
and support the table building questions
that<00:06:57.780> you<00:06:57.900> may<00:06:58.050> have<00:06:58.319> but<00:06:58.680> I<00:06:58.710> hope<00:06:58.889> you<00:06:59.039> picked

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
that you may have but I hope you picked

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.309 
that you may have but I hope you picked
up<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.639> couple<00:07:00.479> of<00:07:00.539> pointers<00:07:00.870> right<00:07:01.080> there

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 
up a couple of pointers right there

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.800 
up a couple of pointers right there
thank<00:07:01.680> you
