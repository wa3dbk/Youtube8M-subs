so this looking forward and planning and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.500 
so this looking forward and planning and
looking<00:04:04.650> at<00:04:04.799> how<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.040> can<00:04:05.400> actually<00:04:05.579> teach

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
looking at how you can actually teach

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.990 
looking at how you can actually teach
yourself<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.380> in<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.739> car<00:04:08.010> rather<00:04:08.790> than

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
yourself in the in the car rather than

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.210 
yourself in the in the car rather than
just<00:04:09.299> relying<00:04:09.599> purely<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.319> supervisor<00:04:10.889> I

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
just relying purely on the supervisor I

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.190 
just relying purely on the supervisor I
think<00:04:11.669> these<00:04:11.790> are<00:04:11.849> all<00:04:12.030> good<00:04:12.510> tools<00:04:12.840> that

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
