00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
like you know that it's gonna float

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.340 
like you know that it's gonna float
rather<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.150> city<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.479> Troy<00:06:13.660> down<00:06:13.870> some<00:06:14.139> stage

okay<00:06:14.919> so<00:06:14.979> at<00:06:15.310> this<00:06:15.490> percent<00:06:15.970> with<00:06:16.090> that<00:06:16.240> rage

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
okay so at this percent with that rage

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.670 
okay so at this percent with that rage
that's<00:06:16.660> definitely<00:06:17.020> not<00:06:17.139> going<00:06:17.260> to<00:06:17.350> trololo

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
that's definitely not going to trololo

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.219 
that's definitely not going to trololo
but<00:06:17.979> it<00:06:18.070> looks<00:06:18.190> like<00:06:18.280> Pikachu<00:06:18.750> just<00:06:19.750> wasn't

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
but it looks like Pikachu just wasn't

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:21.840 
but it looks like Pikachu just wasn't
able<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.500> make<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.680> back<00:06:20.949> that<00:06:21.190> has<00:06:21.310> been<00:06:21.490> one

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
able to make it back that has been one

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.330
