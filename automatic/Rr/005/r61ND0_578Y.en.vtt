00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:21.310
 endless wide desert world a concrete 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.849
 hard slopes 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.849
 water 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.510
 7,100 endless kilometers from the red square 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.860
 in moscow to the Mongolian 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.860
 capital ulan bator 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.739
 she is the toughest test for human 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.739
 and machine 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.809
 the rally trans siberian 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.820
 but did you know that the trans 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.920
 siberian also with almost standard 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 cars like the suzuki grand vitara dem 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.500
 four-wheel drive of the year can handle 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.880
 may I imagine he did it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.799
 A second seemingly ever been with 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.030
 the rally organized trans siberian 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.000
 they are now making for manufactures 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.330
 everybody knows fascination from paris dakar 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.340
 is tapped is actually only with 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.110
 coping with very large budgets 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.069
 and here we have the possibility with 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.929
 relatively close-to-production vehicles I say 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.819
 now relative to light 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.700
 Reconstruction such as underrun protection 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.310
 larger tank roll cage because of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.259
 Safety can be such an event 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.619
 join in and can be very successful 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.420
 his 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.580
 Richard is the pro and he loves me 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.110
 now with and siegling offers but 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.509
 I would say so really in 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.270
 the kavalier city or at all 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.299
 the power of us is not at rest 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.490
 drive always ahead then approach 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.549
 we are at the first discipline namely 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.379
 Steep mountain permanent four-wheel drive 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.489
 We always have a great size here like tara 

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.489
 now need a terrain reduction 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:06.099
 yes in any case we have to go to 4 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.869
 So hole go to the reduction 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.060
 because the slope is very steep 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.340
 then it goes up but 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.750
 terrain reduction works yes why 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 a climber who walks in too 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.370
 serpentine high and not in the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 drop line 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.840
 becomes a hedgehog of higher speed 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.430
 just more torque on the wheel 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.810
 transferred and now it goes on the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.450
 side down again richard what you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.610
 Now the most important thing is that one now 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.280
 The foot of the clutch simply takes 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.700
 exploit the engine braking power 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 that start again gently now 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.150
 Just let the wheels roll 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.040
 always roll does not block thus is 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.040
 the car steers and controllable 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.209
 every now and then I have to do a little bit 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 praise yourself 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.730
 I'm kind of tasted now 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.440
 has come this trade is still 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.470
 much steeper and longer to pack 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.450
 also much momentum or I want 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.450
 yes, now we have to build 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.550
 which both if we descended from the mother 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.129
 so now only once keep calm foot 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.670
 away from the clutch we stay with you 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.830
 Stop the brake on the brake and do it 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.090
 now something untypical without the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.470
 clutch to connect 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.980
 we set the reverse gear what is 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.260
 not brutal and now it actually comes 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.360
 the most difficult task we start 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.540
 now the engine without the clutch too 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.420
 kick in with gear engaged therefore the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.340
 advantage that in the moment where the engine 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.890
 the vehicle is moving 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 Immediately puts the engine brake with you 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.180
 So just work the keys 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.739
 Turn around again and easily release the brake 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.290
 in the moment where you get the key around 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.260
 brakes easily solve yes well and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.180
 holding the steering wheel 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.010
 wonderful things have worked 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.989
 scary but soon again 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:05.010
 died that is a real pro 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:06.750
 tip what do we have because you know by heart 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.120
 street barricades at the rally trans 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.639
 siberian but we want to go through here and 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.280
 that's pretty awful yes that has 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.680
 is borderline especially the underground 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.310
 there is something we need to overcome 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.660
 clear out so that does not spoil but 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.000
 otherwise it looks good 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.680
 pac man really you do me well 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.720
 give it to richard this drive all the way 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.669
 on the slope is one of the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.520
 scariest exercises in the terrain 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.010
 how do I realize if you tip over yes 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.680
 mostly when you notice it's too late 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.410
 if you feel uncomfortable you should 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.860
 all do not draw down to the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:52.819
 focus to relocate 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.199
 has gone well, let's see 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
 if I'm fit for the rally trans 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.949
 Siberian was definitely that 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:04.310
 I can do that with the 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:06.379
 of course that is a whole 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.500
 other noise he wants richard 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:12.100
 he did not think anything anymore 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.100
 anonymous 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.110
 again comes the whole affair 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:24.800
 I have the feeling of rape 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.800
 the expression 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.660
 minister 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.660
 is really fun 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.940
 even though 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.710
 really fun 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.710
 was 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.320
 the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.270
 yes, then I have a huge turnout 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.790
 How to make it clean again 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.920
 with the pressure washer work takes 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.210
 At least two days everything can be on 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.210
 Thank you for the tips
