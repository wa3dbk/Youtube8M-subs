the ultra fear is basically your

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.980 
the ultra fear is basically your
progressive<00:01:18.340> park<00:01:19.340> shredder<00:01:19.640> who<00:01:20.240> wants<00:01:20.900> to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
progressive park shredder who wants to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.330 
progressive park shredder who wants to
get<00:01:21.110> more<00:01:21.320> performance<00:01:21.470> out<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.070> their

get more performance out of their

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.430 
get more performance out of their
horoscope<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.750> construction<00:01:24.260> of<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
horoscope so the construction of the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.520 
horoscope so the construction of the
ultra<00:01:24.740> fear<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:26.150> base<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.900> waxen<00:01:27.500> fuse

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
ultra fear the base is a waxen fuse

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.280 
ultra fear the base is a waxen fuse
sintered<00:01:28.220> base<00:01:28.370> so<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.150> super<00:01:29.420> hard<00:01:29.630> super

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
sintered base so it's super hard super

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.530 
sintered base so it's super hard super
fast<00:01:30.550> cora<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.790> ultra<00:01:32.030> fear<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.480> a

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
fast cora on the ultra fear is a

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.190 
fast cora on the ultra fear is a
desolate<00:01:33.530> core<00:01:33.830> which<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.760> dual<00:01:35.360> species<00:01:35.900> so

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
desolate core which is a dual species so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.250 
desolate core which is a dual species so
basically<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.400> we<00:01:37.550> use<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:37.790> beach<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.690> poplar

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
basically it we use a beach and poplar

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.590 
basically it we use a beach and poplar

ultra pier is a by X on the top and a
triax<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.760> base<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.690> there<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.140> also<00:01:48.470> a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
triax on the base so there is also a

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.310
