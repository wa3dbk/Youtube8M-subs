 the flight cras in hamburg hotel that we can 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.730
 see in one of the pictures of the game because 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.420

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.040
 very unlikely to have coop missions

 with split screen in the game the assaults 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710

 clear 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.140
 according to the rockstar team the look of 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.540
 Franco was what changed the most since the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.030
 start of game development 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.260
 look like holographic cartridges 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.930
 extended and much more 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.360
 the aim is very similar in practice 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.580
 with the max payne 3 with the reticle 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.680

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.690
 everyone will not have michael entered the radios 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.820
 brites play mission details 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.850
 these assault missions out of 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.370
 Central history is called the ex mission 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.669
 begins with the 3 going over the plan in 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.310
 contact the contacts of maico with fig 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.070
 want him to recover something valuable that 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.190
 it is in vehicle dayal internal the band 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.680
 gensse the three dress masks the tremor 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.330
 when the macaque monkey with jason's and 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.030
 franklin with the skull 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 the three go separately in the first 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.889
 half of the mission you can not change the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.139
 characters you have to follow with the 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.789
 he drove a truck to a 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.060
 indicated on the map 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.530
 this is part of the preparations for 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.990
 ambush to get to the point he 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.970
 parks sideways on a strip street 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.550
 only to lock the vehicle route 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.130
 the next task is to take over the 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.770
 Franco in a perfect winch for the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.020
 the mission unfolded so we changed 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.419
 for the tremor that is at a high point 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.639
 and is monitoring the situation with a 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.220
 binoculars to ensure the 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.490
 plane when caught sight of the van 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.710
 to the approaching target franklin alerted 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.840
 he waits for the van to stop because the 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.479
 michael's truck is blocking the 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.000
 franklin van goes with everything 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.580
 on the side of the stove and the 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.280
 makes turn after the hurricane has turned 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.680
 franklin runs toward him plant 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.720
 a bomb in the back he runs 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.280
 to a safe area and detonates the van 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.500
 with ox bar 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.449
 after that they collect what was 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.789
 desired by them in seconds. 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.340
 cars and a helicopter 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.320
 arrived and now you will 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.229
 understand the usefulness of exchanging 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.300
 characters you can do the rest only 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.610
 with a character but with the exchange of 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.160
 character you will facilitate the mission 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.440
 franklin is a local 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.380
 protected with a machine gun 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.570
 michael is as frank as trevor is 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.090
 in a higher location with rifle and a 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.490
 launches grenades to cover 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.860
 For two minutes you will stay 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.110
 in that exchange of characters with many 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.930
 enemies being killed when, for example, 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.650
 You're blunt and an enemy. 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.199
 it's coming a lot 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.570
 close to him but cover in a way 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.120
 how franklin has no angle on you 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.039
 you can switch to the tremor that is 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.440
 the angle to hit the target 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.720
 when you think the helicopter is 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.120
 becoming too dangerous you can 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.490
 switch to the quake and use a spear 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.039
 grenades in the helicopter with only one 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.590
 when the last enemy is 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.870
 dead trevor with greater angle of view 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.750
 will warn you that there is no one else 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.479
 through ead 7 and now it's time 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.760
 that you will pay all the 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.280
 their involvement in this crime as 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.539
 franklin lion rookie he is a beast of 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.490
 clean the dirt 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.860
 he gets into the truck that michael 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.440
 drove and take you to a distant location 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.780
 where they had already planned to 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.300
 to toast the truck obvious that they with the 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.550
 planning already left a car there 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.729
 for franklin to leave the place though 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.800
 seems a linear mission to the point of 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:40.169
 reach the mission already 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.120
 they did a lot of the masks and the 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:44.880
 the winch used by them were 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.160
 conquered in other great missions 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.160
 fifth high test arrives on December 19 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.160
