00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
killstreaks you know why because the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.040 
killstreaks you know why because the
killstreaks<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.240> call<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.480> duty<00:02:16.690> ghosts<00:02:16.870> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
pretty much the highest killstreak that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.940 
pretty much the highest killstreak that
are<00:02:33.820> worth<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.720> points<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.230> they<00:02:35.290> cost<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
are worth the points that they cost and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.860 
are worth the points that they cost and
honestly<00:02:36.700> they<00:02:36.970> get<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> little<00:02:37.360> bit<00:02:37.450> boring<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
