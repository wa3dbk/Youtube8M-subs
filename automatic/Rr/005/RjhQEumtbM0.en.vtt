00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.910
 we are on the newest boat the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.010
 very last as our yard at 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.890
 to make which is called the ix pay 38 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.449
 this boat is both capable of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.830
 win regattas and it is designed to 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.750
 regattas and the one that is presented 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.370
 in front of you in particular shows a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.840
 deck hardware that is perfectly suited 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.890
 to the most advanced crews that we 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.750
 can meet in regatta 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.370
 thanks to the use of technologies 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.800
 sophisticated the boat is in 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.910
 particular very stiff to the canvas that 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.040
 means that he is able to cash 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.630
 difficult conditions without 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.700
 so much asked his crew 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.520
 so it's a perfect boat to go out 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.390
 the weekend or on holidays with two is 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.250
 this duality regattas and ability of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.509
 league and family which is I believe the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.509
 big success of these hazelnuts 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.510
 everything on the outside all this 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.610
 who is on the bridge is perfectly 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.620
 optimized by regattas and so we 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.560
 find all the returns under the bridge 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.130
 in areas that are clear of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.720
 cockpit 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.980
 we have what is called in older 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.860
 that is to say the possibility of settling 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.300
 the genoa when we are in very 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 close with a very strong of 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.680
 multiplications that comes back to the piano 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.240
 we have a carbon racket at 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.670
 the front which usefully replaces an end 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.620
 of retractable bone to be able to wear 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 code- like sails on the edges of 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.930
 reaching 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.390
 everything is designed on the boat so that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.759
 the ergonomics of a racing crew 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500
 either at the top level 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.750
 so at the same time we equipped the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.100
 boat with an electric winch for the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.259
 mainsail halyard for what 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.750
 when you go out alone or as a couple 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.880
 we are not a laborious maneuver 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.960
 to send the mainsail 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.380
 the ergonomics of a regatta boat and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.090
 paradoxically extreme well suited to the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.100
 crew navigation reduced when 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.540
 really wants to go out to two what 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.820
 characterizes the interior of this boat 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 it's once again looking for a 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.989
 optimal boat for the regatta so a 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.640
 looking for weight so the elements of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.769
 furniture contribute to the structure of the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 boat which means that in this 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.510
 boat we chose to have surfaces 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.650
 still polyester we will say enough 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.840
 important that contribute to the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.480
 structure we sought to lighten the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.620
 furniture and we also sought to give 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.430
 an impression of him 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.049
 and clarity in the boat innovation 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.849
 found inside is the 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.379
 chart table that we did the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.890
 choice to have a chart table that can 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.450
 to be both in the direction of the march 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.519
 when one is in navigation but one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.019
 can slide to bring back against 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.150
 partitions in order to clear a more 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.409
 large bench of the square as to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.540
 the hour of the aperitif we want to 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.860
 find at 10 around the table and not 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.810
 to have a table that clutter in 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.090
 midway this boat reconnect with 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.040
 the DNA of the society that is to make 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.069
 boats of very high level 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.069
 performance 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 no
