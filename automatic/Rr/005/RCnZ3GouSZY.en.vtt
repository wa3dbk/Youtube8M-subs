00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
shortest video I can find is 40 seconds

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.379 
shortest video I can find is 40 seconds
okay<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.530> let's<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> math<00:03:59.220> here<00:03:59.400> 40

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
okay so let's do the math here 40

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.250 
okay so let's do the math here 40
seconds<00:04:00.780> per<00:04:00.930> video<00:04:01.159> plus<00:04:02.159> 10<00:04:02.489> seconds<00:04:03.260> we're

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
seconds per video plus 10 seconds we're

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.809 
seconds per video plus 10 seconds we're
just<00:04:04.379> going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> tack<00:04:04.739> on<00:04:04.919> another<00:04:04.949> 10<00:04:05.430> seconds

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
just going to tack on another 10 seconds

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.520 
just going to tack on another 10 seconds
in<00:04:05.940> case<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.239> guys<00:04:06.389> can't<00:04:06.690> find<00:04:06.959> any<00:04:07.139> shorter

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
in case you guys can't find any shorter

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.050 
in case you guys can't find any shorter
videos<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.099> down<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> 40<00:04:08.579> most<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.940> them

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
videos that are down to 40 most of them

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.089 
videos that are down to 40 most of them
are<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> minute<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.079> let's<00:04:10.260> take<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.470> minute<00:04:10.769> and

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
are a minute so let's take a minute and

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.390 
are a minute so let's take a minute and
multiply<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.329> by<00:04:12.389> what<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.530> need<00:04:13.680> 10<00:04:14.010> videos

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
multiply that by what you need 10 videos

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.050 
multiply that by what you need 10 videos
so<00:04:15.359> one<00:04:16.049> video<00:04:16.349> per<00:04:16.409> minute<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.519> need<00:04:17.699> tend<00:04:17.970> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
so one video per minute you need tend to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.159 
so one video per minute you need tend to
make<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:18.389> swagbucks

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
make two swagbucks

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.339 
make two swagbucks
so<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.699> would<00:04:20.909> be<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.870> get<00:04:22.049> six<00:04:23.090> six<00:04:24.349> rewards

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
so that would be you get six six rewards

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.240 
so that would be you get six six rewards
every<00:04:26.219> hour<00:04:26.400> and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
every hour and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.580

me here I'll leave the little simple

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.970 
me here I'll leave the little simple
math<00:04:31.600> equation<00:04:32.260> because<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.650> not<00:04:32.800> hard

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
math equation because this is not hard

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.340 
math equation because this is not hard
math<00:04:33.220> guys<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:34.240> 12<00:04:34.600> swag<00:04:34.990> bucks<00:04:35.200> an

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
and most likely it won't be because it

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.460 
and most likely it won't be because it
takes<00:06:42.370> around<00:06:42.610> an<00:06:42.730> hour<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:43.150> get<00:06:43.300> frozen<00:06:43.900> then
