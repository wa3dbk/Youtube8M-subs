00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello welcome through arduino 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.880
 this time we will see our wing zac 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 inside 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.930
 First of all tell you that it is not the wing and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.780
 original saga but it's one more copy 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.940
 cheap but after all it 's the same 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.940
 to open it come two screws 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.230
 in this case as it is a copy they are not 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.270
 the screws that come originally 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.989
 that are special and are more difficult 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.989
 to open it 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.260
 well once open return here the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.260
 accelerometer 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.530
 here surely it is integrated 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.750
 to control the signals of the data 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.630
 and the clock signal and more 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.329
 and nothing else here we can see the the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.680
 joystick that is here 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.970
 these three legs and these three legs 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.970
 is a three for each axis because they are like 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.660
 potentiometers really 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 and basically these are three cables in 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.990
 a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.079
 on a flat cable 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.119
 that go to the buttons that one will be 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.840
 of some meek and the other two is each 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840
 one for a button 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.490
 and well basically the cables that that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 station is basically a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 as a usb as you can see 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 we have the red feeding that is with 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.759
 3.3 volts the white that is the mass 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.759
 this one here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.620
 and well then we basically need 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.800
 two more cables that are 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.950
 the data and the clock signal 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 good thing if your wilancha which is the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.170
 original surely the signal of the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.170
 watch be the yellow 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.470
 and the green will be the data but good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.120
 if you have a copy or different you can 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.180
 be different every time I know but good 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.300
 we can basically see it here I do not know if 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.410
 it will look but here below with which it is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.720
 each pin 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.960
 Y 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 and nothing more good I advise you to open it 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.319
 to see if 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.040
 if you are choosing well the pins that 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.300
 they are from each and nothing else 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.220
 and good now 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.520
 let's see how to connect it with our 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.520
 Arduino 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.010
 now let's see how to connect our 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.319
 Arduino 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.269
 good if you look for the library I will leave in 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 the description of the video we only have 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.159
 that place it inside the library file 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.819
 which is inside the folder of the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.819
 arduino program 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.959
 you have to know that the library does not 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.609
 works with those of 11.0 superior as well 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.659
 who downloaded the latest version of 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.650
 arduino that also to put in the 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.730
 description 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.730
 as you can see 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.910
 the red wire we have put it on the pin 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.860
 of the 33 volts in our arduino 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.740
 and then the target we have put in the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.000
 ground 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:36.300
 and then our blue that is the data 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.260
 we have put it on pin 4 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.780
 what is the analog input and the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.050
 green that was our our sign of the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.850
 clock generates 5 and good using the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 bookstores that I leave you should not have 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.650
 no problem if you want in the video 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.030
 that appears in the corner you can see what 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.670
 what can you do with the wide wing here 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.730
 find a code to do what you 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.299
 must in the video 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.950
 up here here the tutorial and 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.150
 I hope that it has served you and until 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.150
 next video goodbye 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.830
