this calling by all the remains and I've
had<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> number<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> questions<00:00:13.349> about<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
had a number of questions about the the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.890 
had a number of questions about the the
drum<00:00:14.820> fill<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> end<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
drum fill that's at the end of the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.330 
drum fill that's at the end of the
guitar<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.410> look<00:00:16.619> two<00:00:16.770> thirds<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> way

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
guitar so look two thirds of the way

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
guitar so look two thirds of the way
through<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> song<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> I'm<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> show

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
through the song so I'm going to show

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.779 
through the song so I'm going to show
you<00:00:19.320> exactly<00:00:19.650> what's<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.520> part

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you exactly what's going on in that part

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.840 
you exactly what's going on in that part
and<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.630> we'll<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.750> surprised<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.529> how

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
and I think we'll be surprised at how

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.300 
and I think we'll be surprised at how
simple<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.920> now<00:00:25.920> notice<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
simple it actually is now notice I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
simple it actually is now notice I
didn't<00:00:26.550> say<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.820> easy<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.689> definitely

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
didn't say it was easy it's definitely

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
didn't say it was easy it's definitely
definitely<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.400> an<00:00:29.519> easy<00:00:29.789> part<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> play<00:00:30.449> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
definitely not an easy part to play I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
definitely not an easy part to play I
mean<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.900> by<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> sheer<00:00:31.260> velocity<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:32.250> what

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
mean just by the sheer velocity of what

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
mean just by the sheer velocity of what
the<00:00:33.210> song<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.660> general<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.410> part<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:34.980> far

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the song in general but that part as far

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
the song in general but that part as far
as<00:00:35.250> what's<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
as what's going on there and in that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.250 
as what's going on there and in that
whole<00:00:36.719> fill<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> mean<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.710> moving<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
whole fill I mean it's it's moving so I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
whole fill I mean it's it's moving so I
counted<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:41.040> basically<00:00:41.460> double<00:00:41.730> time<00:00:41.879> or

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
counted like basically double time or

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
counted like basically double time or
full<00:00:42.180> time<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.390> guess<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> 1<00:00:43.829> 2

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
full time I guess so it's like in a 1 2

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.720 
full time I guess so it's like in a 1 2
3<00:00:44.250> 4<00:00:44.520> 5<00:00:44.730> 6<00:00:45.000> 7<00:00:45.180> 8<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> context<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
3 4 5 6 7 8 so in that context the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
3 4 5 6 7 8 so in that context the
entire<00:00:48.059> drum<00:00:48.420> fill<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.110> straight

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
entire drum fill is just straight

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
entire drum fill is just straight
sixteenth<00:00:50.160> notes<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.700> nothing<00:00:51.000> funky

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
sixteenth notes there's nothing funky

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.590 
sixteenth notes there's nothing funky
going<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> any<00:00:52.860> rests<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.600> mixing

going on by a way of any rests or mixing
up<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.469> any<00:00:55.590> doubles<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.070> singles

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there's no triplets going on it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.560 
there's no triplets going on it's
straight<00:00:58.260> ahead<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.530> sixteenth<00:00:58.920> notes<00:00:59.160> or

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
straight ahead at sixteenth notes or

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.279 
straight ahead at sixteenth notes or
thirty-second<00:01:00.570> notes<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.989> you're<00:01:01.109> counting

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
thirty-second notes if you're counting

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.030 
thirty-second notes if you're counting
it<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.770> half<00:01:01.980> time<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.840> starts<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it like half time it it starts on the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800 
it like half time it it starts on the
rack<00:01:05.549> Tom<00:01:05.760> -<00:01:06.030> depending<00:01:06.330> which<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> want

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
rack Tom - depending which one you want

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
rack Tom - depending which one you want
to<00:01:06.900> use<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> high<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to use I use the high one and then to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
to use I use the high one and then to
the<00:01:08.729> snare<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.330> foot's<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the snare then foot's and so on and so

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
the snare then foot's and so on and so
on<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.799> breaking<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.310> fours<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
on so you're just breaking up fours and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
on so you're just breaking up fours and
sixes<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.450> twos<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> stuff<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
sixes and twos and stuff like that so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
sixes and twos and stuff like that so
it's<00:01:13.740> basically<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:24.049> that's<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's basically like this that's the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's basically like this that's the
whole<00:01:25.380> pattern

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:51.720 

you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.790 

you
