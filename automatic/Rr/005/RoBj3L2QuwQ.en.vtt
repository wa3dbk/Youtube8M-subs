would<00:01:47.729> work<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.119> best<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.659> we're<00:01:48.750> actually

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
would work the best here we're actually

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
would work the best here we're actually
be<00:01:49.049> better<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.500> ever<00:01:49.710> before<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> think

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
be better than ever before I think

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.389 
be better than ever before I think
exploration<00:01:51.600> genre<00:01:51.930> right<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.710> deluded<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
exploration genre right and i deluded to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
exploration genre right and i deluded to
like<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> Miss<00:01:53.850> type<00:01:54.119> game<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.020> believe

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
like the Miss type game and I believe

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.200 
like the Miss type game and I believe
Paul<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.130> mentioning<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:57.090> actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
Paul was mentioning that that actually

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.670 
Paul was mentioning that that actually
be<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> lonely<00:01:57.869> experience<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
be kind of a lonely experience which is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
be kind of a lonely experience which is
a<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:58.890> good<00:01:59.100> point<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.969> horror<00:02:00.240> could

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a very good point I think horror could

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
a very good point I think horror could
be<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> horror<00:02:01.770> could

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
be good but i think the horror could

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
be good but i think the horror could
actually<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.340> too<00:02:02.549> intense<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:02.969> most<00:02:03.180> people

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
actually be too intense for most people

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
actually be too intense for most people
like<00:02:03.869> i<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.049> saying<00:02:04.170> slender<00:02:04.560> man<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.799> already

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
like i was saying slender man is already
scary<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> monitor<00:02:05.729> imagine<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.570> turn

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
scary on a monitor imagine if you turn

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.029 
scary on a monitor imagine if you turn
around<00:02:06.930> slenderman's<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.740> your<00:02:07.829> face

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
around slenderman's right in your face

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.229 
like people would like throw the headset
off<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.200> stomp<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> ground<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.760> think

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
off and stomp on in the ground I think

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.040 
off and stomp on in the ground I think
those<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.420> kind<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.720> games<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
those are kind of games have to be

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
those are kind of games have to be
patient<00:02:13.230> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
patient with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.230 
patient with
wonder<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:13.860> maybe<00:02:14.040> some<00:02:14.640> sort<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> fighting

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
wonder if maybe some sort of fighting

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.310 
wonder if maybe some sort of fighting
game<00:02:15.420> experience<00:02:15.930> could<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.140> very

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
game experience could be very

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.990 
game experience could be very
interesting<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
interesting you know it's got a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360 
interesting you know it's got a
first-person<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.800> know<00:02:19.830> movement

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
first-person yeah and you know movement

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.500 
first-person yeah and you know movement
would<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.580> an<00:02:20.640> issue<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.180> fighting<00:02:21.480> games

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
would be an issue but in fighting games

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.240 
would be an issue but in fighting games
are<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> right

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
are basically just going like that right

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
are basically just going like that right
so<00:02:23.460> if<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.760> depend<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.120> how<00:02:24.180> close<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.570> are<00:02:24.750> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
so if you depend on how close you are in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.030 
so if you depend on how close you are in
bobbing<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.560> again<00:02:25.740> you'd<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> be

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
bobbing but again you'd have to be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
bobbing but again you'd have to be
careful<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.490> physical<00:02:26.970> fatigue<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
careful with physical fatigue and so I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.810 
careful with physical fatigue and so I
think<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.890> comes<00:02:29.010> down<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.190> flow<00:02:29.550> games

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
think when it comes down to flow games

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.840 
think when it comes down to flow games
games<00:02:30.450> such<00:02:30.690> as<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.900> flying<00:02:31.740> games<00:02:32.130> driving

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
games such as a flying games driving

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.580 
games such as a flying games driving
