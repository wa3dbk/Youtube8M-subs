the edge products individually along the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.020 
the edge products individually along the
top<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.689> put<00:01:51.990> into<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.259> second<00:01:52.799> tab<00:01:53.610> row

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
top now we put into a second tab row

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
click on math edge we see the same tab

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.690 
click on math edge we see the same tab
some<00:02:00.329> color<00:02:00.570> changes<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.829> font<00:02:02.100> changes<00:02:02.460> but

some color changes some font changes but

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.039 
some color changes some font changes but
