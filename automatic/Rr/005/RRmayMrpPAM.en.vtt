00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 
as you can tell the frame is now

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.470 
as you can tell the frame is now

complete we've got the bottom frame and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.249 
complete we've got the bottom frame and
the<00:00:10.540> top<00:00:10.780> frame<00:00:11.139> screwed<00:00:12.129> on<00:00:12.309> to<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:12.580> legs<00:00:13.259> we

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
the top frame screwed on to the legs we

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.599 
the top frame screwed on to the legs we
screwed<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.370> four<00:00:15.910> outer<00:00:16.180> legs<00:00:16.600> on<00:00:16.900> first<00:00:17.609> now

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
screwed the four outer legs on first now

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:25.439 
screwed the four outer legs on first now
I<00:00:20.130> put<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.340> back<00:00:21.580> leg<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.470> inch<00:00:24.340> gap<00:00:24.760> so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
I put the back leg with the inch gap so

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.620 
I put the back leg with the inch gap so
that<00:00:25.599> when<00:00:25.750> I<00:00:25.810> put<00:00:26.320> on<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.710> plywood<00:00:27.189> wall<00:00:27.670> it

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
that when I put on the plywood wall it

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.150 
that when I put on the plywood wall it
just<00:00:28.779> gives<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.230> nicer<00:00:29.619> finish<00:00:29.830> in<00:00:30.130> my

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
just gives it a nicer finish in my

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.670 
just gives it a nicer finish in my
opinion<00:00:30.699> but<00:00:31.179> this<00:00:31.420> isn't<00:00:31.630> necessary<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:32.500> can

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
opinion but this isn't necessary you can

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.560 
opinion but this isn't necessary you can
put<00:00:33.010> it<00:00:33.100> up<00:00:33.280> flash<00:00:33.610> I<00:00:36.600> also<00:00:38.399> put<00:00:39.399> in<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:40.059> other

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
put it up flash I also put in the other

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.459 
put it up flash I also put in the other
two<00:00:42.120> crossbars

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
two crossbars

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.900 
two crossbars
so<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.340> third<00:00:45.699> cage<00:00:46.180> will<00:00:46.539> sit<00:00:47.320> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so that the third cage will sit in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.990 
so that the third cage will sit in
that's<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.059> final<00:00:49.510> step<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.760> completes<00:00:51.760> the

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
that's the final step that completes the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.349 
that's the final step that completes the
frame<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.250> can<00:00:54.370> see<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.820> inner<00:00:55.090> legs

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
frame and as you can see the inner legs

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.330 
frame and as you can see the inner legs
are<00:00:55.809> in<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.530> four<00:00:56.739> corners<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:59.129> they<00:01:00.129> are

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
are in the four corners and they are

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.479 
are in the four corners and they are
sandwiched<00:01:01.149> between<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.109> crossbars<00:01:03.070> for

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
sandwiched between the crossbars for

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.820 
sandwiched between the crossbars for
each<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.850> cages<00:01:04.300> in<00:01:04.840> the<00:01:04.960> center<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
each of the cages in the center and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.600 
each of the cages in the center and
that's<00:01:09.340> how<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.640> build<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.360> frame<00:01:11.190> from<00:01:12.190> here

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
that's how I build the frame from here

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's how I build the frame from here
what<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.000> will<00:01:13.270> do<00:01:13.420> next<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:14.020> painting<00:01:14.470> this

what I will do next is painting this

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.570 
what I will do next is painting this
frame<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.850> double<00:01:16.240> coat<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:17.250> oil<00:01:18.250> paint

builder's choice I use oil paint to help

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.930 
builder's choice I use oil paint to help
seal<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.050> wood<00:01:29.230> so<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.370> urine<00:01:30.610> that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
seal the wood so that the urine that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.160 
seal the wood so that the urine that
gets<00:01:31.150> on<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.530> won't<00:01:33.180> make<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.360> rot<00:01:34.540> out<00:01:34.750> quicker

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.650 
is cooler I put them on I have often
thought<00:01:59.560> about<00:01:59.790> taking<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.180> walls<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.600> I

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
thought about taking the walls that I

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.750 
thought about taking the walls that I
have<00:02:01.930> off<00:02:02.700> however<00:02:03.700> my<00:02:04.300> days<00:02:05.160> if<00:02:06.160> you've<00:02:06.490> seen

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
have off however my days if you've seen

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.370 
have off however my days if you've seen
my<00:02:07.000> dough<00:02:07.830> pan<00:02:08.830> before<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:10.330> have

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
my dough pan before they have

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.630 
my dough pan before they have
houses<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.220> when<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.290> weather<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.410> warm<00:02:14.950> they

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
houses and when the weather is warm they

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.460 
houses and when the weather is warm they
all<00:02:15.880> go<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.300> house<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.600> stay<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
all go in the house and stay in the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.610 
all go in the house and stay in the
house<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.880> I'm<00:02:19.030> not<00:02:19.240> sure<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.900> cooler<00:02:20.500> in

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
house so I'm not sure if it's cooler in

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.770 
house so I'm not sure if it's cooler in
the<00:02:20.740> house<00:02:20.950> or<00:02:21.250> why<00:02:21.490> they<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.210> they're

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
the house or why they do that they're

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.100 
the house or why they do that they're
hutches<00:02:23.290> are<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.710> shade<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.580> they're<00:02:24.990> never<00:02:25.990> in

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
hutches are in shade so they're never in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.160 
hutches are in shade so they're never in
the<00:02:26.410> Sun<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:27.580> because<00:02:27.720> they<00:02:28.720> go<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the Sun but because they go in the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.700 
the Sun but because they go in the
houses<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.220> hot<00:02:30.490> then<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.900> thought<00:02:32.170> okay

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
houses when it's hot then I thought okay

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.980 
houses when it's hot then I thought okay
well<00:02:32.860> we'll<00:02:33.250> go<00:02:33.670> with<00:02:33.850> their<00:02:34.030> instinct<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.810> so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
well we'll go with their instinct and so

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.650 
well we'll go with their instinct and so
I've<00:02:35.170> left<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.650> walls<00:02:35.860> up<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:37.120> me<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.420> seems

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
I've left the walls up to me it seems
