 as promised to talk about what 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.430
 eat before bed and roll the forrÃ³ 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.470
 asked who to eat carbohydrate 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 at night it will get fat and if I really 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.080
 Should I eat anything from the vehicle? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 it was a password 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 In response to the following, you have 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.930
 lose weight have to do to dry 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.479
 It is true that you control the quantity 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.310
 of carbohydrate before in football 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.280
 much benefit from eating just because it comes 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 with fat or fat proteins because 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.330
 I speak trans fats good fats 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.270
 they are really very efficient for 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.470
 that you can sleep without hunger 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.619
 depending on how much fat you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.810
 consume like avocado for example that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.910
 I am rich in various substances 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.070
 He is very good for very bad cortisol. 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.200
 a famous touch of stress cake that 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.880
 make you sings then 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
 with the options before bed for you 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.830
 What's in a drying phase is going to be late? 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.630
 much for me ends up having a very long day 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.880
 long and really hungry 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.159
 the boiled egg itself or scrambled oil 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.590
 coconut oil avocado shaped 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.870
 avocado guacamole with it you make one 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.210
 teaching end makes a protein cream 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.479
 so it's also very interesting you 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.900
 can do and if you have that 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.310
 hypertrophy 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.780
 I do not see a problem with you putting a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.940
 amount of carbohydrate before 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.680
 also sleeping then smaller and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.350
 low glycemic index you can put 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.570
 integral wafer is self 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.750
 100% integral because it has to 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.450
 to receive the label is a soup a porridge of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.100
 oatmeal or miguel you can never do 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.590
 with vegetable milk are some options 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.630
 interesting by C &amp; A for example to 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.340
 You do both sleeping and sleeping. 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.650
 quiet until you sleep hungry 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.110
 first football you can sleep 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.070
 is a very bad feeling right when 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 put some carbohydrate 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.239
 documents can release the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.910
 a neurotransmitter called 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.280
 serotonin which is what helps control 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.590
 better the school x or gives a feeling of 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 well being is very interesting is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.010
 that some people feel that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440
 said difference of eating something from 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.209
 milk is also very interesting because 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 it is rich in tryptophan which also 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.770
 help in this conversion of serotonin and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 melatonin that will make you 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.530
 sleep better then our voice spoke 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.480
 of how hot milk is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.640
 a little honey I thought 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.100
 interesting then you already both 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.860
 the protein with a kilo of sugar cup 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.620
 milk in the dose and sugar in honey 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.870
 also so if you think you are in the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.430
 focus to dry be very careful with 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.100
 Sunday carbohydrate 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.750
 but I think it 's worth you to think 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.420
 and talk with show in the trio put a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 small portion of the protein is 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.380
 Good fat, I think they are very 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
 heated steps have already come from 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.010
 sleeping installment includes avocado as 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.600
 I said that's what you're trying to take care of. 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.580
 little more of the fat puts just to 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.150
 egg or egg whites scrambled at the time of 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.650
 a little coconut and the cinnamon that is 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.510
 very good also sweetener for those who 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
 consumes sweetener okay you did 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.140
 hypertrophy ok quantity 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.690
 low-carbohydrate diet 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.250
 The glycemic index tells consumers to 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.300
 an individualized and 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.370
 custom 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.620
 but remember sleep well is key 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.930
 for any result that you want 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.100
 and looking for a quality of life is 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.620
 I hope it helped a little. 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.410
 I work here for you, I'm afraid. 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.670
 Sleeping holds more doubts short a 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.310
