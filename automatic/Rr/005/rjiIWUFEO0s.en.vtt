camera and we're here with the trick

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.179 
camera and we're here with the trick
that<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.779> sometimes<00:00:07.170> use<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.649> these<00:00:07.770> matrix

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
that we sometimes use on these matrix

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.100 
that we sometimes use on these matrix
tots<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.730> lot<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> people<00:00:09.510> inquire<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
tots a lot of people inquire about the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.440 
tots a lot of people inquire about the
matrix<00:00:10.320> dots<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.910> deal<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.300> them

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
matrix dots and how to deal with them

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.240 
matrix dots and how to deal with them
well<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.290> many<00:00:13.530> techniques<00:00:13.860> I've

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
well this is one of many techniques I've

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.820 
well this is one of many techniques I've
seen<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.639> work<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.839> my<00:00:15.929> personal<00:00:16.170> favors

especially on a Mustang everybody knows
that<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.740> Mustang<00:00:20.130> has<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.460> make<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.789> spots<00:00:21.029> at

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that a Mustang has to make your spots at

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
that a Mustang has to make your spots at
the<00:00:21.210> top<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.260> same<00:00:22.470> time<00:00:22.740> I've

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the top and just a same time I've

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.009 
the top and just a same time I've
already<00:00:23.400> cleaned<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> prepped<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> inside

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
already cleaned and prepped the inside

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
of this class and I've already shrunk

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.470 
of this class and I've already shrunk
some<00:00:27.269> tent<00:00:28.070> over<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.369> class<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> went

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
some tent over this class now I went

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
some tent over this class now I went
ahead<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
ahead is if you see this up here and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
ahead is if you see this up here and
when<00:00:32.880> he<00:00:32.969> had<00:00:33.090> shrunk<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.540> entire<00:00:33.840> window

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
when he had shrunk the entire window

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
when he had shrunk the entire window
dots<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.700> went<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
dots and all and then I went back and I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.270 
dots and all and then I went back and I
just<00:00:36.660> cut<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> bottom<00:00:37.620> row<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> dots<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just cut it the bottom row of dots a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
just cut it the bottom row of dots a
straight<00:00:38.550> line<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.540> separated<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.230> top

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
straight line and I've separated the top

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
straight line and I've separated the top
part<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> bottom<00:00:41.940> part<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
part from the bottom part one of the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
part from the bottom part one of the
reasons<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.379> did<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
reasons I did that is this is the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
reasons I did that is this is the
cheapest<00:00:45.210> quickest<00:00:45.719> easiest<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.980> me<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
cheapest quickest easiest way for me to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.160 
cheapest quickest easiest way for me to
have<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> pattern<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.000> cut<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.719> I'm

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
have a pattern to cut this out with I'm

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
have a pattern to cut this out with I'm
just<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.489> top<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
just going to use this to put on top of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
just going to use this to put on top of
the<00:00:50.910> black<00:00:51.230> material<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the black material which by the way the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.389 
the black material which by the way the
technique<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.809> put<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> black<00:00:55.469> jet<00:00:56.160> black

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
technique is to put a black jet black

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
technique is to put a black jet black
opaque<00:00:56.879> vinyl<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> inside<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.710> going

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
opaque vinyl on the inside and I'm going

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
opaque vinyl on the inside and I'm going
to<00:00:58.920> cut<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.690> duplicate<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.899> piece<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to cut it out to duplicate this piece of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
to cut it out to duplicate this piece of
tent<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> install

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
tent here and then I'm going to install

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.190 
tent here and then I'm going to install
on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> inside<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> install<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
on the inside and I want to install it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
on the inside and I want to install it
after<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.860> install<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> tent<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
after I install the tent it's going to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
after I install the tent it's going to
be<00:01:09.930> installed<00:01:10.200> last<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
be installed last but then I want to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
be installed last but then I want to
take<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> glass<00:01:12.119> behind<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> show

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
take you to the glass behind me and show

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.359 
take you to the glass behind me and show
you<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
you how we do this

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
you how we do this
you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.850> determine<00:01:18.049> which<00:01:19.049> side

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
you know first we determine which side

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.020 
you know first we determine which side
there's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.920> release<00:01:20.280> liner<00:01:20.549> which<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there's a the release liner which the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780 
there's a the release liner which the
side<00:01:21.290> facing<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> check<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
side facing me and one way I check is I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.210 
side facing me and one way I check is I
divide<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:26.390> well<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.049> sure

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
divide it and see well just to make sure

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
divide it and see well just to make sure
because<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.400> didn't<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> release<00:01:30.000> liner

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
because I didn't want the release liner

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.100 
because I didn't want the release liner
facing<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:30.990> example<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
facing me in this example and I want to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.270 
facing me in this example and I want to
go<00:01:34.229> ahead<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> tent

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
go ahead and I want to put the tent

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.650 
go ahead and I want to put the tent
pattern<00:01:38.280> above<00:01:38.549> me

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
pattern above me

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.500 
pattern above me
so<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:41.900> see<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:43.510> then<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.630> take<00:01:44.870> my<00:01:45.020> final

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
so I can see it then I take my final
