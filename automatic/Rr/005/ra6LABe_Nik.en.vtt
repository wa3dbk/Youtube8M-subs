00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the reality walter lily indeed 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.899
 so do as I said 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.599
 just like that otherwise 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.990
 junkie renders and then that amodio appointed a total of 116 points 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:18.759
 so we are 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.820
 at 116 points in the source language at this time 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.939
 an advantage on that lady and should not go there 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.569
 especially 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.410
 in the second the third and the fourth moto 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.410
 the very strong reason with a faultless ride there 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 four penalty points is in the last ride 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 good at this competition 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.390
 and is too 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 left very well 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 excellent art 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 the icc not a lot of nice bascule 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.060
 it's not good with the shoulder above 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.400
 it an excellent uden the party 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.749
 it's sad but on 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.310
 the back of each other may be able to swing with its all in kiewit 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 happy to type at having showjumper 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 he noted that 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.760
 bean the week in the competition 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.100
 such a team is growing 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.590
 jump with a lot of power 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.870
 qatar evil and reality crows 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.160
 it went wrong 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.340
 particularly good during the course of the competition 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.330
 advanced the first 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.680
 de la tourette 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280
 the sirens 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.930
 last year from 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 2000 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.790
 also gets longer and if this is true that the students 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.400
 ronald bernaerts 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.770
 and our incurred 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.730
 for a car 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 he is no longer eligible 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.490
 the champion title 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.169
 unless a half miracle happens of course 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.169
 but then there must be a lot of people there 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.619
 remove the beam from the spoons 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.990
 according to the population the combination 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.949
 as they should do everything 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.289
 you should be freaking out with the buying 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.459
 but that the second and last moto does not stop at 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.590
 this combination and in the first three heats already a clear round will not come 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 more eligible for the title but we still want to show something that said 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 be ready for the better work 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.729
 we are a lot of combinations that line 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.769
 to several also was previously on the message
