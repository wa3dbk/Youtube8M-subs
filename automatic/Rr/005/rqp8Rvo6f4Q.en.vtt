00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.380
 hi to all and hervé hervé cuisine 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 bantam-weight 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.270
 today we realized together 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.220
 if you want a sand and xxl at 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.380
 lemon strawberry tart with 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.150
 a cream with vanilla mascarpone 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.740
 and fresh strawberries all 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.710
 ingredients for the recipe you'll have 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.150
 need to make shortbread dough 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.929
 50 g icing sugar 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 200 g of flour 1 lemon untreated and 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.260
 100 g half- salted butter for the cream 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.840
 you will need 250 g of mascarpone 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.969
 30 centilitres of liquid whole cream 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.340
 vanilla sugar or a pod of 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.629
 vanilla and sugar also here 50 g 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.699
 of sugar and finally of course 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.059
 strawberries that you can replace with a 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.649
 fruit that you love even more then 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.480
 the first step we will realize the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 cream so it's very simple you been the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.949
 mascarpone 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.550
 in a big bowl are you going to beat 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.580
 Whisk all fit to their 250 grams 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.740
 should smartphones let's put some of the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.030
 liquid cream 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 so take the liquid cream cream 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.570
 complete 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 in fact we will realize a kind of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.820
 Chantillac well thick vanilla so 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.340
 I take vanilla sugar that I made 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.970
 house with lots of pod seeds 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.890
 vanilla for well scented this is my 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.310
 cream and sugar so slightly sweet 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.630
 barely 50 grams is what I'm going 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.290
 to do is I'm going to premix and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.630
 all with a hand whip 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.420
 then I'll have it all at 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 freezer for 30 minutes so that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.210
 the mixture is extremely cold it is 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.119
 the key to success if you want to have 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 a cream that show well between is a 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.810
 which is very thick 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
 so for the rest it's very simple 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.730
 heat your oven to 180 ° 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.530
 make a shortbread in a sand and that 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.660
 will put in the bottom of a pie pan 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.200
 of a circle so the flour the sugar 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.850
 ice cream 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.990
 we mix all that quietly 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.670
 go we go with our hands today 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.430
 you can make this paste to the robot 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.990
 or with the hands is what I'm going 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 to do is I'm going to add the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.880
 butter so butter at temperature 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.500
 rather cold than too soft already 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.450
 cut into small cubes and end of 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.220
 fingers you'll see the knead the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.390
 butter in the flour it is necessary that the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.390
 flour absorbs all the butter 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.640
 so in the beginning you go like that and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.860
 then after you hesitate to sandblasted 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.920
 like that in your hands when it will be 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.420
 a little more to a little more absorb the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.570
 butter is well integrated with my flour 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.460
 with a rap I just put the zest of 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.010
 lemon in the dough its a super share 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.320
 well we can do that with a zest 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 of orange also if you wish there is 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.550
 no problem ok here I have a buzz is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.300
 very generous 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.760
 I mix again see the dough if 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.140
 I press on it this compact that's it 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.420
 it's good it's good for our sand and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.780
 well it's gone we'll put the dough 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.340
 in the bottom of the mold 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.540
 you can use a pie tin 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.640
 so I advise you to use a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 mold with removable bottom 1 it will be a lot 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.959
 easier to recover all your CVs 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.500
 on time or a circle 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.459
 so you can this one is 22 cm from 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.830
 diameter you use between 20 and 26 that 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 you will make a shortbread more or less thick 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.110
 on a plate with a sheet of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.260
 cooking simply I'm going to have 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.260
 my pass 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.970
 fama powder at this stage it's still from 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.900
 the powder you distribute well your 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.970
 preparation 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.670
 in the bottom so of your circle and 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.890
 with a cookie cutter so a pusher 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.720
 important pieces you will come 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.490
 simply packed this is your 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.990
 preparation you see we have it 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:18.090
 something compact it's going to be a 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:21.600
 superb shortbread smelling super good already the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.060
 lemon so that's going to cook we're going 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.120
 start by cooking for 15 minutes 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 oven at 180 ° hop the center see here is not 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.850
 did not pass too much but you have it's 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:40.320
 still well it must be 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.220
 homogeneous and we're going to see more 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.220
 at 15 minutes 5 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.860
 after 30 minutes in the freezer 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.760
 it is to beat so our cream at 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.820
 mascarpone loc 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.980
 I had also seen the whip in the cold 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.150
 the refrigerator to ensure that all goes to 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.410
 cold you'll see we'll get a 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.640
 super firm texture 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.640
 let's go five minutes 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:19.219
 and that's the hop result 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.080
 look at the super texture that we get 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.930
 this is the com of the cream 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.249
 super thick chantilly 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.949
 so that's fifteen thousand that know 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.060
 is cooking hockey sent he 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.800
 started to take off a little bit 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.860
 edges so what I suggest 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.520
 at this point it's sprinkling a little 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.529
 little with icing sugar and their past 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.710
 in the oven so always at 180 degrees a 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.969
 slightly higher up in the oven if possible 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.439
 that's it for five minutes so that will do 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.009
 come cooking everything so why 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.529
 this step 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.330
 it's just going to be a little 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.800
 caramel crust on your shortbread and 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.740
 prevent it from softening with the 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.990
 cream and go for the assembly 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.860
 so I'm going to ask them my cookies on 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.020
 a grid so that they cool 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.949
 completely 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.740
 here I am laying in the background in front of 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.490
 the plate two presentation services 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.719
 you see what I said a 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.669
 powerful jolt of caramel 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.650
 formed on it and so that will make 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.319
 waterproof so your cookies that goes 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.270
 stay crunchy with cream that I 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.789
 will now pour over so at 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.400
 using a piping bag 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:26.210
 that's it and we're going to do some 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.289
 nice decor as well that the banks are 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.289
 starts with the outside 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.069
 and finally so I just decorate with soon 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.229
 2013 so I cut my strawberries in two 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.889
 so that does not have to be 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.430
 super regular 1 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.430
 the idc here is to have a finish 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.430
 gourmet 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.030
 so it's very simple the cream is very 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.330
 thick in strawberries tienne super 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.330
 well on it 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.980
 here is a little bit of everything so 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.480
 irregular is perfect and here we are 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.910
 for deco I suggest you by 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:22.210
 example why not some flakes of 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:24.790
 coconut over it or else from 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.980
 icing sugar or why not zest 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.810
 lemon to remind you that you had to 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.170
 cheat in the base of which you go by 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:36.760
 the lemon strawberry mix will come to us 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:38.530
 it is rather canon our sand and xxl at 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.820
 lemon with vanilla mascarpone cream 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.410
 and the fees and loan look like 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.460
 how pretty I really hope this is 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.500
 to make them at home you will see 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.970
 it's easy and post your photos on
