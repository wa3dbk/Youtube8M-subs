00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.359
 to remove windows acceleration 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.549
 we have to go to the beginning and in the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.790
 search engine we have to put configuration 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.889
 mouse 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 where it changes the configuration of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.639
 mouse click here and the only thing that we 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 interesting about the window this is the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.190
 third tab where it puts options of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.220
 pointer 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.920
 we enter and where can improve the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.080
 pointer accuracy this box has 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 that be disabled and when it puts 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.500
 selection in pointer speed 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.020
 has to be in the sixth win this 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 hairline 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.400
 for this to not be counting on 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 hairline in hairline and we put a 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.110
 slower position and with the arrow towards 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 the right of the keyboard we count up to the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.460
 sixth position we would be at the first 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.010
 second third fourth fifth and sixth 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.300
 we apply and accept I'm not going to 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.020
 accept because I'm going to apply the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 difference because because we use 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.590
 the sixth tic and not the fastest then 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.660
 for this we go to paint and create 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.300
 a spiral 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.140
 you will be seeing that the stratum more than 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.240
 these areas of expiring then if we 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.870
 let's go to the fastest tab or to the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.570
 faster hairline 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.080
 and we do it again one more time 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 spiral you will be seeing that apart from 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.290
 of not having the same precision is 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 coming out the pixilated spiral because it's 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.060
 coming out of the spiral pixelated then 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.550
 because he's trying to get two pixels 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.970
 or two points within one that is what 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.980
 same as he was explaining 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.840
 in the previous video with the theme of 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.329
 of country then 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 the most optimal and the best is what 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.750
 recommends everyone is to play 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.899
 we are in the first second third and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.899
 quarter 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.610
 we apply and accept 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 and for this very reason why I am 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.430
 seeing the spiral I recommended play 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.980
 country tapes instead of 3000 or 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 any other value because if not what 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.940
 we would be creating would be these 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.010
 imperfections that you are seeing in the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 spiral so my recommendation is 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.930
 play 900 the page with sensitivity 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.710
 from windows to 6 and with acceleration of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.710
 windows hospital
