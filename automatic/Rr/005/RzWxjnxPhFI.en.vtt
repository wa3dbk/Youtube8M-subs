system a three gallon tank with filter
I'm<00:02:08.899> wondering<00:02:09.619> how<00:02:09.830> often<00:02:10.489> should<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.879> change

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
I'm wondering how often should I change

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.059 
I'm wondering how often should I change
the<00:02:11.629> water<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.140> how<00:02:12.319> much<00:02:12.500> water<00:02:12.739> should<00:02:12.890> be

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
the water and how much water should be

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.390 
the water and how much water should be
taken<00:02:13.459> out<00:02:13.580> also<00:02:14.060> should<00:02:14.599> i<00:02:14.629> take<00:02:14.810> my<00:02:14.959> betta

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
taken out also should i take my betta

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.890 
taken out also should i take my betta
of<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.549> tank<00:02:15.760> before<00:02:15.939> cleaning<00:02:16.360> or<00:02:16.689> just

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
of the tank before cleaning or just

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.869 
of the tank before cleaning or just
leave<00:02:17.079> them<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.379> tank<00:02:17.579> that's<00:02:18.579> a<00:02:18.670> really

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
leave them in the tank that's a really

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.550 
leave them in the tank that's a really
good<00:02:18.970> question<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.260> through<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
good question and that is through a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.759 
good question and that is through a
3-gallon<00:02:21.340> Eclipse<00:02:21.670> system<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.390> very<00:02:23.110> middle

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
3-gallon Eclipse system is very middle

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.130 
3-gallon Eclipse system is very middle
of<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> line<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.700> great<00:02:25.209> starter<00:02:25.689> tank<00:02:25.959> for

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
of the line a great starter tank for

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.479 
of the line a great starter tank for
people<00:02:26.379> just<00:02:26.409> getting<00:02:26.799> started<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.159> bettas

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
people just getting started with bettas

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.089 
people just getting started with bettas
it's<00:02:27.700> perfect<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.060> one<00:02:28.329> fish<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.920> thing

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
it's perfect for one fish and the thing

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.440 
it's perfect for one fish and the thing
about<00:02:30.129> three<00:02:30.579> gallon<00:02:30.879> tank<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.299> can

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
about three gallon tank is you can

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.990 
about three gallon tank is you can
really<00:02:31.599> go<00:02:31.810> two<00:02:32.560> ways<00:02:32.829> you<00:02:33.579> could<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.819> one

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
really go two ways you could do one

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.119 
really go two ways you could do one
hundred<00:02:34.269> percent<00:02:34.299> water<00:02:35.200> changes<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.040> that

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
hundred percent water changes and that

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.259 
hundred percent water changes and that
would<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.370> fine<00:02:36.549> because<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:37.000> small<00:02:37.239> enough

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
would be fine because it's small enough

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.420 
would be fine because it's small enough
to<00:02:37.720> manage<00:02:38.079> or<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.069> could<00:02:39.250> go<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.790> cycle<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to manage or you could go and cycle it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.649 
to manage or you could go and cycle it
basically<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.640> you're<00:02:42.730> doing<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.450> cycle

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
basically what you're doing if you cycle

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.750 
basically what you're doing if you cycle
a<00:02:43.900> tank<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.379> you're<00:02:44.530> allowing<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.189> bacteria

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
a tank is you're allowing the bacteria

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
a tank is you're allowing the bacteria
that<00:02:45.819> live<00:02:46.120> naturally<00:02:46.329> in<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> water<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.739> grow

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that live naturally in the water to grow

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.729 
that live naturally in the water to grow
and<00:02:48.579> multiply<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.389> consume<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.290> fish<00:02:50.500> waste

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
and multiply and consume the fish waste

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.699 
and multiply and consume the fish waste
as<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.159> being<00:02:51.340> produced<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.510> really<00:02:53.079> tank

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
as it's being produced so really tank

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.589 
as it's being produced so really tank
cycling<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.489> preferred<00:02:55.120> method<00:02:55.299> it

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
cycling is the preferred method it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.240 
cycling is the preferred method it
creates<00:02:55.900> more<00:02:56.139> stable<00:02:56.560> environment<00:02:57.099> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
creates more stable environment and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.390 
creates more stable environment and
basically<00:02:58.019> basically<00:02:59.019> creates<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.799> complete

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
basically basically creates a complete

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.300 
basically basically creates a complete
ecosystem<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:01.209> an<00:03:01.329> aquarium<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.049> so<00:03:03.010> that's<00:03:03.159> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
ecosystem in an aquarium and so that's a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.369 
ecosystem in an aquarium and so that's a
really<00:03:03.700> great<00:03:03.849> way<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.090> go<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.780> because

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
really great way to go to and because

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.750 
really great way to go to and because
you<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.650> 3-gallon<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.370> kind<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.639> do

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
you have a 3-gallon you can kind of do

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.110 
you have a 3-gallon you can kind of do
it<00:03:06.879> either<00:03:07.030> way<00:03:07.409> if<00:03:08.409> you<00:03:09.010> end<00:03:09.189> up<00:03:09.280> cycling<00:03:10.000> your

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
it either way if you end up cycling your

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.449 
it either way if you end up cycling your
tank<00:03:10.420> what<00:03:10.930> you'll<00:03:11.079> probably<00:03:11.379> want<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:12.069> is

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
tank what you'll probably want to do is

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.649 
tank what you'll probably want to do is
change<00:03:12.939> about<00:03:14.370> ten<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.849> twenty<00:03:16.180> percent<00:03:16.480> of

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
change about ten to twenty percent of

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.270 
change about ten to twenty percent of
the<00:03:16.750> water<00:03:16.930> each<00:03:17.200> week<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:17.799> order<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.129> maintain

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
the water each week in order to maintain

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.059 
the water each week in order to maintain
it<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.169> decide<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.650> go<00:03:20.769> with<00:03:20.889> one

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it and if you decide to go with one

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.920 
it and if you decide to go with one
hundred<00:03:21.160> percent<00:03:21.340> water<00:03:21.730> changes<00:03:22.389> then

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
hundred percent water changes then

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.490 
hundred percent water changes then
you'll<00:03:23.319> need<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.919> change<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.760> water<00:03:24.940> out

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
you'll need to change all the water out

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.650 
you'll need to change all the water out
with<00:03:26.500> some<00:03:26.799> regularity<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.730> how<00:03:28.359> often

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
with some regularity and how often

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.559 
with some regularity and how often
exactly<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.739> depends<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:30.489> your<00:03:30.760> setup<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
exactly that is depends on your setup it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.360 
exactly that is depends on your setup it
depends<00:03:32.109> on<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.199> fish<00:03:32.440> itself<00:03:32.590> how<00:03:33.220> much

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
depends on the fish itself how much

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.670 
depends on the fish itself how much
waste<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:34.000> particular<00:03:34.269> fish<00:03:34.629> produces<00:03:35.169> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
waste that particular fish produces the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.379 
waste that particular fish produces the
type<00:03:35.859> of<00:03:36.040> food<00:03:36.250> you're<00:03:36.400> feeding<00:03:36.730> how<00:03:37.150> much

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
type of food you're feeding how much

starts to show a mona ammonia on
whatever<00:04:11.139> day<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.889> it's<00:04:12.459> too<00:04:12.729> long<00:04:12.909> so

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
whatever day that is it's too long so

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.620 
whatever day that is it's too long so
suppose<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.430> test<00:04:15.940> your<00:04:16.060> water<00:04:16.180> every<00:04:16.599> day

day you see oh look I've got some trace

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.320 
day you see oh look I've got some trace
amounts<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.190> ammonia<00:04:21.579> showing<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.120> at<00:04:22.240> my

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
amounts of ammonia showing up at my

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.110 
amounts of ammonia showing up at my
aquarium<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.500> now<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.710> know<00:04:24.039> okay<00:04:24.789> every

eight days I need to change my tank

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.879 
eight days I need to change my tank
water<00:04:26.979> so<00:04:27.700> always<00:04:27.940> keep<00:04:28.150> it

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
water so always keep it

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.709 
water so always keep it
day<00:04:29.069> at<00:04:29.340> least<00:04:29.490> one<00:04:29.699> day<00:04:29.849> less<00:04:30.090> than<00:04:30.120> how<00:04:30.539> long

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
day at least one day less than how long

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:32.989 
day at least one day less than how long
it<00:04:30.810> takes<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.020> show<00:04:31.229> ammonia<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.879> repeat<00:04:32.879> the

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
it takes to show ammonia and repeat the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.640 
it takes to show ammonia and repeat the
test<00:04:33.240> from<00:04:33.419> time<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.810> time<00:04:33.840> because<00:04:34.289> sometimes

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
test from time to time because sometimes

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.189 
test from time to time because sometimes
factors<00:04:35.099> will<00:04:35.400> affect<00:04:35.610> exactly<00:04:36.599> how<00:04:36.900> fast

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
factors will affect exactly how fast

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.719 
factors will affect exactly how fast
ammonia<00:04:37.650> does<00:04:37.800> build<00:04:38.009> in<00:04:38.099> your<00:04:38.219> tank<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.639> I

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
ammonia does build in your tank like I

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.670 
ammonia does build in your tank like I
said<00:04:38.909> you<00:04:39.029> might<00:04:39.150> change<00:04:39.689> your<00:04:39.810> betta<00:04:40.050> food<00:04:40.289> or

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
said you might change your betta food or

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.589 
said you might change your betta food or
you<00:04:40.889> may<00:04:41.069> your<00:04:41.669> betta<00:04:41.879> might<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.120> eating<00:04:42.389> more

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
you may your betta might be eating more

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.769 
you may your betta might be eating more
and<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:43.560> may<00:04:43.740> find<00:04:44.129> that<00:04:44.310> he<00:04:44.610> produces<00:04:45.569> waste

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:45.779 
and you may find that he produces waste

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:47.689 
and you may find that he produces waste
more<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.199> thus<00:04:46.349> ammonia<00:04:46.860> builds<00:04:47.129> more<00:04:47.310> so

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
more and thus ammonia builds more so

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.110 
more and thus ammonia builds more so
repeat<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.479> test<00:04:48.659> from<00:04:48.779> time<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.110> time<00:04:49.139> and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
repeat the test from time to time and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.700 
repeat the test from time to time and
then<00:04:51.120> you'll<00:04:51.330> know<00:04:51.509> exactly<00:04:51.689> how<00:04:52.349> long<00:04:52.529> you

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
then you'll know exactly how long you

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.360 
then you'll know exactly how long you
can<00:04:52.740> go<00:04:52.919> between<00:04:53.189> my<00:04:53.999> water<00:04:54.240> changes<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
can go between my water changes the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.029 
can go between my water changes the
second<00:04:56.699> question<00:04:56.879> is<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:57.930> email<00:04:58.379> is<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.919> have

second question is this email is I have
been<00:04:59.189> feeding<00:04:59.460> my<00:04:59.729> betta<00:04:59.969> with<00:05:00.240> hikari<00:05:00.659> bio

feeding him well I think one to two
pellets<00:05:09.180> per<00:05:09.389> day<00:05:09.509> is<00:05:09.569> probably<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.110> little<00:05:10.409> too

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650

pellets<00:05:18.060> in<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.419> evening<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.400> see<00:05:20.400> how<00:05:20.490> your

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
pellets in the evening and see how your

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.249 
pellets in the evening and see how your
but<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:20.909> does<00:05:21.060> kind<00:05:21.569> of<00:05:21.599> watch<00:05:21.750> them<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.139> see

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
but it does kind of watch them and see

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.829 
but it does kind of watch them and see
if<00:05:22.289> he<00:05:22.469> does<00:05:22.650> well<00:05:22.889> that<00:05:23.759> isn't<00:05:23.909> our<00:05:24.120> overfed

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:24.839 
if he does well that isn't our overfed

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.689 
if he does well that isn't our overfed
well<00:05:25.379> bloat<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.039> you'll<00:05:26.219> notice<00:05:26.430> that<00:05:26.550> they

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
well bloat and you'll notice that they

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.070 
well bloat and you'll notice that they
get<00:05:26.819> really<00:05:26.939> swollen<00:05:27.419> in<00:05:27.689> the<00:05:27.779> abdomen

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
get really swollen in the abdomen

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.019 
get really swollen in the abdomen
particularly<00:05:28.770> males<00:05:29.009> females<00:05:29.430> sometimes

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
particularly males females sometimes

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.369 
particularly males females sometimes
will<00:05:30.180> show<00:05:30.330> some<00:05:30.360> swelling<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.169> abdomen

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
will show some swelling in the abdomen

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.679 
will show some swelling in the abdomen
anyway<00:05:31.860> if<00:05:32.129> they<00:05:32.249> have<00:05:32.370> eggs<00:05:32.550> but<00:05:32.909> with<00:05:33.479> male

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
anyway if they have eggs but with male

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.200 
anyway if they have eggs but with male
so<00:05:33.990> poof<00:05:34.589> right<00:05:34.830> up<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.189> know<00:05:35.370> when<00:05:35.939> they<00:05:36.060> eat

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
so poof right up you know when they eat

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.939 
so poof right up you know when they eat
too<00:05:36.419> much<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:37.139> you<00:05:37.199> know<00:05:37.439> that<00:05:37.620> they're<00:05:37.800> being

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
too much so you know that they're being

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.459 
too much so you know that they're being
overfed<00:05:38.520> but<00:05:39.089> you<00:05:39.240> know<00:05:39.360> typically<00:05:39.839> six

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
overfed but you know typically six

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.790 
overfed but you know typically six
pallets<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.919> day<00:05:41.099> isn't<00:05:41.879> is<00:05:42.509> fine<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.439> give<00:05:43.650> us<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
pallets a day isn't is fine so give us a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.980 
pallets a day isn't is fine so give us a
try<00:05:43.949> you<00:05:44.069> might<00:05:44.399> even<00:05:44.430> move<00:05:44.969> up<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.330> eight<00:05:45.509> you

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
try you might even move up to eight you

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.360 
try you might even move up to eight you
know<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.139> wouldn't<00:05:46.409> typically<00:05:46.919> do<00:05:47.129> more<00:05:47.279> than

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
know I wouldn't typically do more than

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.070 
know I wouldn't typically do more than
10<00:05:47.550> pallets<00:05:47.759> a<00:05:47.969> day<00:05:48.120> splitting<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.839> up<00:05:48.930> you

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
10 pallets a day splitting it up you

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.360 
10 pallets a day splitting it up you
know<00:05:49.169> five<00:05:49.379> in<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.620> morning<00:05:49.919> five<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.099> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
know five in the morning five in the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.490 
know five in the morning five in the
afternoon<00:05:50.899> if<00:05:51.899> you're<00:05:52.110> better<00:05:52.289> isn't

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
afternoon if you're better isn't

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.350 
afternoon if you're better isn't
bloating<00:05:53.009> at<00:05:53.129> that<00:05:53.310> then<00:05:53.520> it's<00:05:53.639> probably<00:05:53.849> fine

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
bloating at that then it's probably fine

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.570 
bloating at that then it's probably fine
but<00:05:54.960> if<00:05:55.050> he<00:05:55.139> gets<00:05:55.319> poofy<00:05:55.919> in<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.159> abdomen

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
but if he gets poofy in that abdomen

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.939 
but if he gets poofy in that abdomen
area<00:05:56.759> then<00:05:57.029> you<00:05:57.120> know<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:58.169> too<00:05:58.439> much<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:58.889> I

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
area then you know it's too much but I

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.499 
area then you know it's too much but I
think<00:05:59.159> one<00:05:59.310> or<00:05:59.430> two<00:05:59.550> pellets<00:05:59.789> is<00:06:00.029> probably<00:06:00.419> a

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
think one or two pellets is probably a

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.499 
think one or two pellets is probably a
little<00:06:00.659> too<00:06:00.960> low<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.639> can<00:06:02.879> increase<00:06:03.330> that

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
little too low so you can increase that

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.290 
little too low so you can increase that
a<00:06:03.750> bit<00:06:04.189> the<00:06:05.189> third<00:06:05.370> part<00:06:05.610> of<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.699> question<00:06:05.969> is

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
a bit the third part of the question is

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.779 
a bit the third part of the question is
my<00:06:06.990> betta<00:06:07.199> fish<00:06:07.409> is<00:06:07.620> relatively<00:06:08.069> small<00:06:08.490> about

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
my betta fish is relatively small about

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.730 
my betta fish is relatively small about
one<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.419> third<00:06:09.449> inch<00:06:09.810> long<00:06:10.080> without<00:06:10.259> tails

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
one and a third inch long without tails

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.950 
one and a third inch long without tails

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
normal for a betta fish I've noticed

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.639 
normal for a betta fish I've noticed
that<00:06:20.550> these<00:06:21.360> days<00:06:21.689> that<00:06:22.199> is<00:06:22.319> seem<00:06:22.469> to<00:06:22.560> be

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
that these days that is seem to be

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:24.559 
that these days that is seem to be
younger<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:22.979> younger<00:06:23.159> in<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.580> store<00:06:23.849> several

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
younger and younger in the store several

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.209 
younger and younger in the store several
years<00:06:24.870> ago<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.259> used<00:06:25.409> to<00:06:25.649> be<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.860> opposite

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
years ago it used to be the opposite

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.769 
years ago it used to be the opposite
that<00:06:26.520> is<00:06:26.639> could<00:06:26.819> be<00:06:26.849> a<00:06:26.939> year<00:06:27.180> old<00:06:27.479> by<00:06:27.629> the<00:06:27.689> time

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
that is could be a year old by the time

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.689 
that is could be a year old by the time
you<00:06:28.050> purchased<00:06:28.589> them<00:06:28.680> in<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> store<00:06:29.099> and<00:06:29.399> they

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
you purchased them in a store and they

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.339 
you purchased them in a store and they
were<00:06:29.759> typically<00:06:30.149> completely<00:06:30.689> full<00:06:30.870> grown<00:06:31.139> but

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
were typically completely full grown but

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.110 
were typically completely full grown but
for<00:06:31.560> some<00:06:31.710> reason<00:06:32.099> I<00:06:32.339> don't<00:06:32.849> know<00:06:32.909> this<00:06:33.060> is

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
for some reason I don't know this is

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.820 
for some reason I don't know this is
just<00:06:33.240> in<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:33.569> US<00:06:33.779> or<00:06:34.139> if<00:06:34.259> this<00:06:34.349> is<00:06:34.409> worldwide

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
just in the US or if this is worldwide

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.709 
just in the US or if this is worldwide
but<00:06:35.189> here<00:06:35.639> in<00:06:35.729> the<00:06:35.819> US<00:06:36.120> I've<00:06:36.300> noticed<00:06:36.659> that

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
but here in the US I've noticed that

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.180 
but here in the US I've noticed that
they<00:06:37.019> seem<00:06:37.169> to<00:06:37.229> be<00:06:37.319> younger<00:06:37.589> and<00:06:37.860> it<00:06:38.069> might

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
they seem to be younger and it might

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.829 
they seem to be younger and it might
just<00:06:38.310> be<00:06:38.490> that<00:06:38.519> there<00:06:38.759> are<00:06:38.849> more<00:06:39.060> betta

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
just be that there are more betta

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:40.830 
just be that there are more betta
breeders<00:06:40.259> and<00:06:40.289> the

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
breeders and the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.770 
breeders and the
market<00:06:41.110> now<00:06:41.340> but<00:06:42.340> it's<00:06:42.669> not<00:06:43.150> at<00:06:43.300> all<00:06:43.389> uncommon

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
market now but it's not at all uncommon

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.330 
market now but it's not at all uncommon
to<00:06:44.080> get<00:06:44.199> a<00:06:44.230> fish<00:06:44.470> that<00:06:44.500> isn't<00:06:44.980> quite<00:06:45.070> full

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
to get a fish that isn't quite full

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.360 
to get a fish that isn't quite full
grown<00:06:45.550> yet<00:06:45.790> at<00:06:46.000> the<00:06:46.449> fish<00:06:46.600> store<00:06:46.630> so<00:06:47.280> take<00:06:48.280> your

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370
