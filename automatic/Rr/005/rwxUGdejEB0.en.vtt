00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
be learning how to make the form of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
be learning how to make the form of
static<00:00:27.750> hardness<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.400> some

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
static hardness so you need some

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089 
static hardness so you need some
scribing<00:00:29.939> tools<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.840> paper<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.949> go

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
scribing tools and some paper then go

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.160 
scribing tools and some paper then go
into<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.399> art<00:00:32.610> fits<00:00:32.820> tab<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.750> click<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
into your art fits tab and click on the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.030 
into your art fits tab and click on the
form<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> static<00:00:34.829> harness<00:00:35.219> research<00:00:37.910> something

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
form a static harness research something

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.290 
form a static harness research something
so<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> research<00:00:41.399> notes<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:42.030> bucked

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so with the research notes put bucked

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.810 
so with the research notes put bucked
and<00:00:42.660> scram<00:00:43.620> comes<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.579> you'll<00:00:44.789> see

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and scram comes back in and you'll see

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
and scram comes back in and you'll see
it<00:00:45.180> needs<00:00:46.670> travel<00:00:47.670> writer<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> lightest<00:00:50.670> or

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it needs travel writer the lightest or

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
it needs travel writer the lightest or
flight<00:00:51.270> air<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.850> Makana<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.250> lettuce

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
flight air and Makana so the lettuce

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.970 
flight air and Makana so the lettuce
goes<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.360> air<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.440> easily<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.219> we<00:01:00.149> can

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
goes to air really easily so we can

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.990 
goes to air really easily so we can
eventually<00:01:01.980> link<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.300> Makana<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
eventually link to them then Makana is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
eventually link to them then Makana is
fruit<00:01:06.000> motifs<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:06.900> links<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> air<00:01:07.439> pretty

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
fruit motifs which links to air pretty

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
fruit motifs which links to air pretty
easily<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.100> travel<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.700> motifs<00:01:12.240> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
easily as well and travel is motifs so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
easily as well and travel is motifs so
that<00:01:12.720> makes<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.140> user<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:25.610> press<00:01:26.610> on

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that makes pretty user so if we press on

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
that makes pretty user so if we press on
each<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.680> join<00:01:35.369> moves

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
each of these like then just join moves

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
each of these like then just join moves
up<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.100> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
up like that and so with that you just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
up like that and so with that you just
want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.549> click<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.810> you'll<00:01:45.990> get

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
want to right click it and you'll get

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
want to right click it and you'll get
the<00:01:46.229> research<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.670> need

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the research so what you're gonna need

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.440 
the research so what you're gonna need
is<00:01:48.530> iron<00:01:49.530> ingots<00:01:49.860> two<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> them<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.880> air<00:01:51.060> shards

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
is iron ingots two of them to air shards

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
which you move up flying so let's use in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
which you move up flying so let's use in
our<00:02:07.469> figures<00:02:08.629> air<00:02:09.629> shards<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.679> enchant<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.310> I

our figures air shards to enchant it I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.729 
our figures air shards to enchant it I
think<00:02:11.640> maybe<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.959> once<00:02:13.140> you've<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.440> all<00:02:13.560> those

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
think maybe so once you've got all those

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.080 
think maybe so once you've got all those
items<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:15.030> want<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:17.090> infusion

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
enough vision you want so you need 25 of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.020 
enough vision you want so you need 25 of
each<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.980> right-click<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> remit<00:02:53.700> matrix

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
each just right-click the remit matrix

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.740 
each just right-click the remit matrix
and<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:55.260> infusion<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:55.769> begin<00:02:56.330> sorry<00:02:57.330> guys<00:02:57.510> I

forgot<00:02:57.900> about<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.500> UM<00:03:00.110> essentia<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.440> need

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
forgot about the UM essentia so you need

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.660 
forgot about the UM essentia so you need
42<00:03:02.220> machinae<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:04.500> think<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.159> 16

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
42 machinae I think it's 16

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.300 
42 machinae I think it's 16
pilatus<00:03:06.739> 16<00:03:07.739> potentia<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.900> 16<00:03:09.900> item<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.190> I've

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
pilatus 16 potentia and 16 item but I've

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.030 
pilatus 16 potentia and 16 item but I've
got<00:03:11.459> more<00:03:11.610> than<00:03:11.760> enough<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.510> safe<00:03:12.690> so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
got more than enough just to be safe so

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.680 
got more than enough just to be safe so
like<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> said<00:03:14.190> with<00:03:14.459> enough<00:03:15.090> essentially<00:03:15.599> when

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
like I said with enough essentially when

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.570 
like I said with enough essentially when
you<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.930> right-click<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.680> relate<00:03:17.250> matrix

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
you want right-click the relate matrix

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.729 
you want right-click the relate matrix
and<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.659> ritual<00:03:18.900> will<00:03:19.170> begin<00:03:21.440> as<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.500> see

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
and the ritual will begin as you see

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.860 
and the ritual will begin as you see
there<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.190> can<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.610> with<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.970> what<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.659> is

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
there you can see with it what it is

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.650 
there you can see with it what it is
taking

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.940 

just<00:03:33.660> make<00:03:33.840> sure<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.230> your<00:03:34.470> items<00:03:34.800> are

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
staying on the pedestals which an air

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.420 
staying on the pedestals which an air
shard<00:03:37.260> has<00:03:37.440> disappeared<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.040> we're<00:03:38.310> gonna

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
shard has disappeared so we're gonna

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:47.630 
shard has disappeared so we're gonna
have<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.580> replace<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.310> its<00:03:47.400> without

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
have to replace that so for its without

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.070

complete we'll get the harness thing
there<00:04:32.770> we<00:04:32.860> go

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.080 

form<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.210> static<00:04:37.540> harness<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.490> what<00:04:39.640> this<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:39.910> is

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
form a static harness so what this is is

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.400 
form a static harness so what this is is
a<00:04:40.390> device<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.740> make<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.980> fly<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.200> read

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
a device to make you fly so if we read

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.150 
a device to make you fly so if we read
the<00:04:44.590> formal<00:04:45.490> combatant<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:47.040> double<00:04:48.040> tap

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
the formal combatant you just double tap

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.310 
the formal combatant you just double tap
space<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.790> fly<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.270> hold<00:04:49.600> space<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.050> go<00:04:50.170> up

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
space to fly and hold space to go up

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.740 
space to fly and hold space to go up
left<00:04:50.770> shift<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.100> do<00:04:51.190> go<00:04:51.610> down<00:04:51.790> it's<00:04:52.390> basically

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
left shift to do go down it's basically

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:04.730 
left shift to do go down it's basically
like<00:04:52.960> creative<00:04:53.590> mode<00:04:55.950> sweet<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.040> foreman<00:04:57.280> on

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
harness at bits of the it fits it so if

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.110 
harness at bits of the it fits it so if
you<00:05:08.710> press<00:05:08.860> F<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:13.830> don't<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.890> what<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.040> did<00:05:15.130> but

you press F I don't know what I did but

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.020 
you press F I don't know what I did but
it<00:05:16.270> made<00:05:16.420> noise<00:05:20.040> while<00:05:21.040> active<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.670> harness

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
it made noise while active the harness

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.300 
it made noise while active the harness
will<00:05:22.180> constantly<00:05:22.540> use<00:05:22.690> potentia<00:05:26.040> so<00:05:27.040> but

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
will constantly use potentia so but

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.190 
will constantly use potentia so but
because<00:05:27.460> I'm<00:05:27.700> in<00:05:27.730> creative<00:05:27.970> mode<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.570> haven't

because I'm in creative mode I haven't

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.360 
because I'm in creative mode I haven't
got<00:05:29.290> any<00:05:29.410> potential<00:05:29.740> for<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.160> I<00:05:30.190> don't

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
