00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
all seriousness I've been running with

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.759 
all seriousness I've been running with
Vibrams<00:02:13.640> probably<00:02:13.970> for<00:02:14.060> about<00:02:14.209> four<00:02:14.420> years

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Vibrams probably for about four years

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.979 
Vibrams probably for about four years
that's<00:02:15.769> what<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.980> trained<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.989> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
that's what I trained in and the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.320 
that's what I trained in and the
difference<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.440> these<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:20.150> quite

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
difference in these is it's quite

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.850 
difference in these is it's quite
noticeable<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.140> first<00:02:21.320> thing<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.650> could

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
noticeable the first thing that I could

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.130 
noticeable the first thing that I could
really<00:02:22.010> address<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.760> try<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.660> heel<00:02:23.870> striking

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
really address is try to heel striking

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.949 
really address is try to heel striking
these<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:24.860> gonna<00:02:25.100> happen<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.090> if<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
these it's not gonna happen so if you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.449 
these it's not gonna happen so if you
could<00:02:27.080> tell<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.410> other<00:02:27.560> video<00:02:27.920> blogs<00:02:28.220> and
