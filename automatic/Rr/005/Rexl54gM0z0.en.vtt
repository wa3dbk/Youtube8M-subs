00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
put the real Windows Phone I mean not

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.840 
put the real Windows Phone I mean not
the<00:02:48.709> Windows<00:02:48.980> Phone<00:02:49.160> what<00:02:49.580> am<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> talking

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
the Windows Phone what am I talking

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.120 
the Windows Phone what am I talking
about<00:02:50.000> Windows<00:02:50.930> 7<00:02:51.380> because<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.980> actually

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
about Windows 7 because this is actually

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.770 
about Windows 7 because this is actually
I<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.840> Windows<00:02:54.140> XP<00:02:54.560> um<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:56.060> might<00:02:56.600> look

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
I think it's Windows XP um it might look

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.259 
I think it's Windows XP um it might look
like<00:02:56.840> Windows<00:02:57.200> Vista<00:02:57.530> somehow<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.030> not

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
like Windows Vista somehow but it's not

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.270 
like Windows Vista somehow but it's not
Windows<00:02:59.600> Vista<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.170> actually<00:03:00.530> Windows<00:03:00.890> XP

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
Windows Vista it's actually Windows XP

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.759 
Windows Vista it's actually Windows XP
that's<00:03:01.819> my<00:03:02.150> guess<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.660> think<00:03:03.110> because<00:03:03.530> like

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
that's my guess I think because like

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.500 
that's my guess I think because like
back<00:03:04.099> then<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:04.640> had<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:04.880> virus

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
back then what had a virus

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.069 
back then what had a virus
I<00:03:05.540> had<00:03:05.810> Windows<00:03:06.170> XP<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.890> probably<00:03:07.370> use<00:03:07.730> a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
I had Windows XP so you probably use a

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.590 
I had Windows XP so you probably use a
fake<00:03:09.079> Windows<00:03:09.530> 7<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.760> probably<00:03:10.970> updated

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
fake Windows 7 or just probably updated

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.340 
fake Windows 7 or just probably updated
Windows<00:03:11.900> XP<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:13.060> whatever<00:03:14.060> um<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:17.350> really

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350

Windows XP like whatever um I really
want<00:03:18.560> Windows<00:03:18.799> 7<00:03:19.100> because<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.400> heard<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.700> never

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
want Windows 7 because I heard it never

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.720 
want Windows 7 because I heard it never
gets<00:03:20.090> viruses<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.170> goes<00:03:21.320> super<00:03:21.650> fast<00:03:21.730> so
