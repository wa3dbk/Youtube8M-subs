00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.119
 half a year from injury points 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.499
 and here is the Samson and 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.049
 500 see 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.710
 such beginning of the week get in together in the Samsung 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.050
 this number of victories in 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.499
 m son Levi and like 11 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.939
 So today it's vaccination 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.230
 the peculiarity is of course that is a welcome 6 inches like that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.099
 Iran 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 Sabu policeman 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.039
 All cars look like it 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.039
 that is 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.160
 so economic areas 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.670
 Samson pliable 20 millisievert 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.970
 it will be noticed that numbers should 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.780
 the one device 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.020
 who bake themselves send 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.909
 that is 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.600
 Picture rtr 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 Sven Schaffer 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 the ship 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 and then here again this is nonsense 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.320
 so that should 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.330
 here in black 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 With a shot, the percentages dive up to the lid 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.340
 with the guest 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.310
 the first class 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.140
 and thus naturally attracts fingerprints and scratches magically 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.680
 which you can then see, of course 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 which may not be the case with a white Opel 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.680
 now that drew because of the connections and there we would have on the left side 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.870
 so once 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.180
 a usb port 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 of course, in the government's approval, a Hariri 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.690
 once last year 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.760
 and shows off a mare here 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.590
 she is at the front 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 only the card reader 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.490
 the 4th 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 filled with an appointment 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.740
 rather best side 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.030
 to lay down with 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.810
 Connections for the headphone microphone 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.199
 then again two USB ports 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.869
 and the power connection 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.329
 and which is very nice 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.099
 Mimis can see 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 come often shy 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.470
 and the house goes on with the device 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.679
 Chur - after almost everything 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.679
 was supplied 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.719
 Berlin together 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.779
 also with the water 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.159
 Rechsteiner 20 that is 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.239
 the sheep the classics the fittest 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 Century this gap now with all its neighbors 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.609
 Rheine 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.039
 Cloth bag made of very light fabric 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.839
 the device of course is AKTIF protects against scratches 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.729
 but not more than that 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.670
 rabid handling his device 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.670
 He should definitely buy a padded bag 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.839
 Ravenhill, for example, expensive 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.799
 n510 silly backpack stuck Bolt 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 that's what they say 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.969
 With 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.969
 5200 mAh 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.180
 but we can do that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 demonstrated 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.759
 let's see how long the hero of the 9th 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.239
 through the m &amp; m graphics card 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.269
 Of course, the battery life is slightly lower than others 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.219
 to Intel 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.619
 Lush notebooks or netbooks 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.619
 I will be streets 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.239
 again the power supply 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.979
 over many years 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.979
 March stronger 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.099
 One thing is telling us a lot 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.709
 again 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.619
 energetic offer 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.639
 For example, we have one 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.180
 Guide for the trucks count 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.759
 how you make your system 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.139
 then once 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.139
 Samsung service to the people of the world 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.870
 the Samsung es60 Tuesday otherwise 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
 determine the warranty 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.569
 and more is also not heard 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.099
 "So come back to see in 500 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.059
 like you just see the chamber 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.159
 here with protective foil on it 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.659
 Wallace read open 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.509
 note the easy care 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.529
 the food Schönheim Mater plastic 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.150
 the consumption became 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.559
 not the name here either 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.539
 more have no problem with the earthquake 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.710
 What should also be noticed is for me rather than display people tend 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.059
 here won and not so much from the camera and the tripod 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.710
 its a relatively matte display 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.860
 which of course very much like 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.050
 who can already leave now 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.189
 Samsung nc10 Innocenzi 20 had 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.580
 Of course we will love the track as well 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.719
 Bielefeld I already have 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.339
 before he does not get me a samsung device 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.339
 spending time outside is nonsense in Sicily 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.229
 had to do that 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.639
 and very good pressure point 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.999
 funny too 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.490
 nowhere 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.520
 Press game path through all systems processed 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.620
 you can cry out very pleasant 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.270
 and these concerns are great as in the Senate 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.270
 Intel GMA 6-inch device 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.009
 Romanians still look on it is her 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.259
 Horst Heldt 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.830
 that is of course very important as a mouse replacement 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.029
 because you do not always have to deal with extremes from Dubai 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.979
 also pleasant big surfaces 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.009
 to work 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.930
 Halle Altenrhein 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.389
 Mouse Thorsten Büttner 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.789
 So a cup of error 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.159
 a fast 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.599
 which does not bother me much now 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.599
 some of you already i do not know why 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.960
 and in the books the peculiarity of those 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.539
 a whopping nine points 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.180
 June like the governments of it 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.409
 that means you can also play and play some actors 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:44.460
 the Intel® Parents subsidies 70 Finally at least 82 Corner 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.960
 the 60 megahertz 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.009
 the men cope 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.380
 I will install 100 new games on the system 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.249
 for example, aciano 1404 or else costs the FIA 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.729
 I definitely want to test it 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.729
 The Finn has never been a home game to me 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.899
 if I'm still testing on this one 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.419
 elected into the government inside 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.369
 to see the water from a small Hamburg and Heinz Bruns and Samsung N510 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.830
 the hand about 6 inches in Iraq said notebook 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:22.349
 There will definitely be more tests to follow, especially the GEFMA games 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:24.270
 Interest in the year, of course 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.919
 especially those who are the governments 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.849
 and she definitely possible 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.059
 rich notebook 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:34.169
 still compare with the Samsung x120 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.970
 which should also have a chamber 6 inches around but not one before 2 o'clock 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:40.639
 processor 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.139
 So be curious you are synonymous in any case comparison images and stage 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:46.409
 from this picture here 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.989
 also never heard of points
