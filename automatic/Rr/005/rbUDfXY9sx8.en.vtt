00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 this cold front she arrives in the region 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.760
 the southeast finding a 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 atmosphere with much less humidity than 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.980
 has in the south of the country 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 dry air that predominates over the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.330
 southeast region of the country 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 there will weaken and go to the well 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.380
 greatly reduce rainfall potential 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 of this cold front 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 so although the system can move forward 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 the coast and reach the spirit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 holy power of this instability 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.219
 front will actually be decreased in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 function of this dry mass that predominates 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.129
 still on the southeastern region of the country 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.100
 Well, what happens is the expectation 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.480
 which rains in treatment all areas 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 from the state of são paulo 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.750
 it is not a generalized rain 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.570
 areas of são paulo state will see until 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.479
 the sky is full of clouds plus rain 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 it's going to be very little or maybe 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 no greater instability should 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 happen in areas near the coast 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.700
 south of são paulo until moderate rains 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 see the possibility even of terms 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.619
 Lightning strikes over areas 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.070
 the state of são paulo even that south 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.420
 of mines in the south center of rio de janeiro 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 this Tuesday 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.460
 but the fact that we have lightning does not mean 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.619
 that we have temporal during the fourth 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 Monday the cold front moves a little more 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.020
 there it goes towards the holy spirit and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.009
 we'll have an air infiltration there 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.740
 maritime quite large right on the are 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.119
 paulo in areas of rio de janeiro, then 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.939
 Wednesday will be a day with ooo. 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.360
 maximum humidity is that we would have 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.759
 here in these areas as the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.100
 Paraíba large São Paulo coast 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.829
 paulo rio de janeiro and the forest area 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.349
 in these areas then expectation that the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.060
 rain and throughout the day a rain that 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.390
 it's not very strong but a rain 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 frequent 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.370
 and then the most pro end of the week we 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.080
 let's see that there are still going to occur 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.470
 other rain showers in the region 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.020
 southeast but due to new areas of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.330
 instability that must grow 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.060
 there at the end of the week in areas of 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.890
 south of Brazil and then move on to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.890
 the southeastern region of brazil
