like I think it was six games like
consecutively<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.810> its<00:01:16.020> goals<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.799> two

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
consecutively as its goals in like two

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010

high into the 90s and he deserves it the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.389 
high into the 90s and he deserves it the
way<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.110> playing<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> game<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.219> way<00:01:59.369> he

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
way he was playing in game the way he

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.789 
way he was playing in game the way he
can<00:01:59.729> dribble<00:02:00.030> pass<00:02:00.329> plays<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.530> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
can dribble pass plays it's just it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.230

just<00:02:01.890> incredible<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:02.579> his<00:02:02.700> aggression<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
just incredible now his aggression I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
just incredible now his aggression I
feel<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.719> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.350> but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
feel that that's kind of right but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.139 
feel that that's kind of right but
because<00:02:05.100> he's<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> low<00:02:05.579> center<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:06.060> gravity

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
because he's got a low center of gravity

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
because he's got a low center of gravity
he's<00:02:06.750> always<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> get<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> ball<00:02:08.160> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
he's always there to get the ball like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.279 
he's always there to get the ball like
he's<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.000> annoying<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.660> play<00:02:09.840> against<00:02:10.170> he

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
he's just annoying to play against he

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
he's just annoying to play against he
seems<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:10.770> those<00:02:10.950> deflections<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.730> then

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
seems to get those deflections and then

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.100 
seems to get those deflections and then
he's<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.510> goal

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
he's through on goal

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.900 
he's through on goal
and<00:02:13.200> he<00:02:13.320> will<00:02:13.470> finish<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:14.010> pretty<00:02:14.550> much<00:02:14.670> nine

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and he will finish it pretty much nine

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.310 
and he will finish it pretty much nine
times<00:02:15.210> out<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> ten<00:02:15.630> now<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.020> attacked

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
times out of ten now is attacked

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.630 
times out of ten now is attacked
positioning<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.860> awesome<00:02:17.340> vision

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
positioning is awesome vision

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.300 
positioning is awesome vision
acceleration<00:02:18.540> agility<00:02:18.930> balance<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
acceleration agility balance and that is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130 
acceleration agility balance and that is
probably<00:02:20.430> why<00:02:20.760> he's<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.360> strong<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:21.870> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
probably why he's so strong because of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.570 
probably why he's so strong because of
his<00:02:22.260> balance<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.770> can't<00:02:22.980> push<00:02:23.220> him<00:02:23.430> off<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
his balance you can't push him off the
