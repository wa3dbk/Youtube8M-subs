00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 the code is here killer and this video what 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 because I'm going to ask you for a little something 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.340
 little thing is that you like the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.130
 digimon games because to me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.720
 I sincerely love them a lot and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.150
 They have been bringing them in Spanish for years now 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 and they brought them in English and in fact now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 they are bringing it directly to you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 and they bring them in English they are not even 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 leaving Japan as it is being 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 digimon adventure games that is from the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.520
 psp also the lemon recoder that also 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.270
 it came out for psp and the latter came out 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 also for nintendo 3ds ccoo but with 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 many more improvements but what happens that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.579
 He has not left Japan and it seems that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.969
 he does not want to leave japan 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.789
 it seems that not the people have not 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.310
 bought a lot in these years the games 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.210
 of digimon 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.630
 and usually it's usually apart from that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.250
 they have little success because the people who 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.490
 has juices surely played by 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.550
 piracy and to me sincerely these 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.400
 things bother me that do not come games 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.350
 for piracy is seriously annoying me 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.980
 a lot and that is the lemon 3ds of re 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.140
 coded is the remake is the diamond world 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.710
 from play 1 that once was like 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.320
 a little feint yes as well as you were leaving 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.570
 they moved to an island and you had to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.479
 take the characters to the city and 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.580
 others in fact I started the war zone in 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.070
 this channel but it was not very successful and what 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.020
 I let that in the future go back to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 pick up who knows and in fact I'll 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 pick up a digimon game that leaves it 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.660
 sectioned because I was waiting for what 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580
 they will take out in Spanish and in the end there 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.220
 come out but hey it's in English there 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.840
 english servers and good I can manage 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 how can I 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.229
 to the point I was going to say that this 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.329
 request is therefore for an Italian 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.000
 I'm going to explain a little Italian 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.700
 wants clear that the games of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 Japan of dimon over all the lemon of the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.069
 3ds because you're already talking about doing 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.410
 digimon another test for 3ds in 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.930
 Japan 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.870
 and this has not even left japan 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 therefore he is gathering signatures for 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 come out of Japanese and America and Europe 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.430
 so honestly if you're interested 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.790
 I ask you to please seriously fill out 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.370
 the card is not taking anything you can put 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.709
 another name that is not your real one 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.650
 nothing happens but we go that rates nothing and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.659
 the truth is that it would help very much 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 many people who like juices 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.299
 of lemon and I would buy them so many 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.079
 thanks to that firm and to the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.079
 next yet
