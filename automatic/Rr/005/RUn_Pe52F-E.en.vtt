00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
several years ago Neil Tyson myself

several years ago Neil Tyson myself
Mordecai<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.330> Mike<00:00:18.990> Shara<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.800> sat<00:00:20.189> down<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
Mordecai and Mike Shara all sat down and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.920 
Mordecai and Mike Shara all sat down and
said<00:00:20.820> well<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.360> gonna<00:00:21.450> do<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
said well what are we gonna do for the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.850 
said well what are we gonna do for the
next<00:00:22.050> space<00:00:22.259> show<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:24.029> had<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.800> idea<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
next space show and I had the idea of

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.180 
next space show and I had the idea of
doing<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.910> stars<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.690> remember

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
doing one on on stars and I remember

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.980 
doing one on on stars and I remember
Neil<00:00:29.190> said<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.880> can't<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.270> one<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.600> stars

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
Neil said well you can't do one on stars

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
Neil said well you can't do one on stars
it's<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.680> it's<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.400> gonna<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.699> a<00:00:32.730> bunch<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's just it's just gonna be a bunch of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's just it's just gonna be a bunch of
balls<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.600> gas<00:00:33.809> floating<00:00:34.410> around<00:00:34.470> or<00:00:34.800> nothing

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
balls of gas floating around or nothing

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.569 
balls of gas floating around or nothing
interesting<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.699> look<00:00:35.820> at

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.529 

I<00:00:41.659> had<00:00:42.659> this<00:00:42.839> thought<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.589> really<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:45.030> would

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
I had this thought of really what would

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.349 
I had this thought of really what would
it<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:47.370> able<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> tell<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.300> story

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
it be like to be able to tell the story

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.959 
it be like to be able to tell the story
of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.019> birth<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.469> death<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.979> star<00:00:50.219> with

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
of the birth and death of a star with

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.419 
of the birth and death of a star with
all<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.629> rich<00:00:51.809> visuals<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.219> from

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
all the rich visuals that we have from

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.660 
all the rich visuals that we have from
different<00:00:53.879> NASA<00:00:54.359> missions<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.519> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
different NASA missions it's really the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.259 
different NASA missions it's really the
closest<00:00:57.179> you<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:58.229> come<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.269> solid

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
closest you I think can come to a solid

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.509 
closest you I think can come to a solid
combination<00:01:01.019> of<00:01:01.109> science<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.649> art<00:01:01.799> and<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
combination of science and art and and

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.160 
combination of science and art and and
that<00:01:02.729> has<00:01:02.969> always<00:01:03.180> been<00:01:03.449> something<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> I've

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that has always been something that I've

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.090 
that has always been something that I've
loved

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.060 

what<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.850> unique<00:01:13.210> about<00:01:13.390> our<00:01:13.780> space<00:01:14.439> shows<00:01:14.710> is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
what is unique about our space shows is

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.030 
what is unique about our space shows is
that<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:16.000> scientists<00:01:16.450> are<00:01:16.920> involved<00:01:17.920> from

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
that the scientists are involved from

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.010 
that the scientists are involved from
the<00:01:18.130> very<00:01:18.250> beginning<00:01:19.060> all<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.479> way<00:01:19.659> through

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
the very beginning all the way through

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.200 
the very beginning all the way through
to<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> end<00:01:20.530> every<00:01:21.009> step<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.729> production

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
to the end every step of the production

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.710 
to the end every step of the production
process<00:01:22.290> involves<00:01:23.290> us<00:01:23.440> we<00:01:24.040> went<00:01:24.250> out<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.909> been

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
process involves us we went out and been

process involves us we went out and been
and<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.159> identified<00:01:27.159> which<00:01:28.090> our<00:01:28.330> colleagues

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
and I identified which our colleagues

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.389 
and I identified which our colleagues
was<00:01:28.899> doing<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.229> best<00:01:29.409> work<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.860> each<00:01:30.009> area

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
was doing the best work in each area

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.460 
was doing the best work in each area
that<00:01:30.580> we<00:01:30.850> wanted<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.240> cover<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.750> then<00:01:32.259> when<00:01:32.409> we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
that we wanted to cover and then when we

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.620 
that we wanted to cover and then when we
went<00:01:32.590> meant<00:01:32.950> said<00:01:33.280> look<00:01:33.549> can<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.149> bring

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
went meant said look can you bring

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.719 
went meant said look can you bring
models<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> table<00:01:36.310> can<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.580> bring

models to the table can you bring

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.910 
models to the table can you bring
observations<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.659> table<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.350> will

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
observations to the table that will

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.520 
observations to the table that will
allow<00:01:39.159> us<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.490> tell<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> story<00:01:40.140> using<00:01:41.140> the

show from roughly 40 different
scientific<00:01:50.350> research<00:01:50.800> groups<00:01:51.190> around<00:01:51.369> the

scientific research groups around the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.410 
scientific research groups around the
world<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.110> count<00:01:53.470> all<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.069> people<00:01:54.610> who

world if you count all of the people who
were<00:01:55.810> involved<00:01:56.140> in<00:01:56.409> making<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.369> easily

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
were involved in making that it's easily

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.120 
were involved in making that it's easily
three<00:01:58.270> or<00:01:58.360> four<00:01:58.600> times<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.259> number<00:01:59.530> so

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
three or four times that number so

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.730 
three or four times that number so
you're<00:02:00.759> talking<00:02:01.149> about<00:02:01.240> at<00:02:01.690> least<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:02.440> hundred

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
people go in there and the next time

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.750 
people go in there and the next time
they<00:04:57.599> you<00:04:58.260> know<00:04:58.380> after<00:04:58.680> they<00:04:58.800> come<00:04:59.010> out<00:04:59.039> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
next time they look at the night sky

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.580 
next time they look at the night sky
they'll<00:05:01.409> see<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.800> little<00:05:01.919> bit<00:05:02.190> differently
