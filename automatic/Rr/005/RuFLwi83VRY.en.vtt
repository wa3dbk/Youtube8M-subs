they're they're the exact design same
design<00:02:29.819> frame<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.660> slightly<00:02:31.230> different

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
design frame just a slightly different

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.710 
design frame just a slightly different
carbon<00:02:31.950> makeup<00:02:32.280> which<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.390> difference

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
carbon makeup which the difference

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
carbon makeup which the difference
between<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.350> keep<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.700> two<00:02:35.850> lower

models would be the carbon makeup which
is<00:02:39.090> adds<00:02:39.630> about<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.140> 100<00:02:40.950> gram<00:02:41.100> difference<00:02:41.610> in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
