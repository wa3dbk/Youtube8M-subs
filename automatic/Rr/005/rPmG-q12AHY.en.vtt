00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.610
 no no 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.779
 greetings and welcome all my name is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.050
 raquel now we will be working on 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 This tribal style nail decoration 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 let's start for the nail of my index finger 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.489
 I started by applying a color enamel 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 of rose and also for the nail of my finger 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.620
 annular I did the same but with a color 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 blue once the enamel has dried 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.199
 completely enter with a black color and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.040
 a brush to detail finite that has 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.930
 the finite little tip and little by little go 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.020
 as delineating the area below as if 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 it was a smile and I want this area 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.649
 that I have painted in black 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.940
 It needs a lot but everything is going to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.810
 depend on what you want 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.700
 they can also make it thin 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.200
 and once everything has dried 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.059
 complete apply between your layer of 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
 transparent enamel and here I am 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.540
 demonstrating the nail of my ring finger that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.760
 It is the same but in a different color 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 now for the nail of my little finger 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.560
 I'm starting to apply a glaze 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.910
 in orange color on all my nail and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 Now using a black color together 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.930
 with a brush to outline I'm 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.210
 nothing else outlining the little tips of the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.430
 nail and now I'm going to do exactly the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.030
 same thing but more towards low two 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.030
 lines 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 and finally apply your layer of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.870
 transparent enamel super easy now 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.910
 for the nail that I have on my finger 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.460
 thumb I'm starting to apply a 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.100
 enamel in blue color and now I'm going to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 do as a letter be looking towards 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.520
 down well the veguita and I'm going to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.520
 fill with the color black 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.930
 now on the area above the nail 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.970
 I will do the same with a letter be al 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 backwards and now I'm just going to fill 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.830
 the sides with the same black color 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.410
 do not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.479
 and once everything has dried by 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.220
 complete to apply your enamel 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.020
 transparent 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.000
 now for the design that follows is for 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 the nail that I have on my middle finger 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 I'm starting to use a color 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.470
 orange neon on the tip of my nail 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.730
 under this color I am using a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.730
 mint green 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.970
 under this color I'm going to paint a 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.680
 line in yellow and below this 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.350
 color I'm using a rose 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.690
 i 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.170
 and here I'm just reviewing the color 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.790
 orange and mint green one 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.190
 Once everything has dried in the area 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.470
 orange I'm painting as a way 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.200
 of diamond milestone and I'll fill it with 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.060
 the color black and now I'm going to delineate 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.060
 the sides with a white color 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.959
 and on each tip I will make a 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.360
 line going out and to the sides 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.360
 of the nail with the same white color 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.880
 now I'm going to make a limit 'great 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.460
 dividing the color orange color 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.770
 green 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.670
 below the line in black I'm going to 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.620
 zig zag in pink a 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.620
 side of the nail to the other side 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.290
 now to fill with the rose 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.730
 now over the area below I'm going to do 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.290
 zig zags in orange color but this 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.880
 once the zigzags are going to be looking towards 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.340
 above 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.380
 and now it's time to fill them with the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.690
 orange color 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.210
 decided to use the color white to 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.490
 delineate the zigzags in both color of 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.670
 pink as in orange for the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.670
 two 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.599
 in between I will add 4 dots in 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.599
 black color 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.000
 now I'm going to paint a line in color 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.940
 black dividing the orange color of 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.440
 yellow color and now I'm going to paint a 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.600
 line in white dividing the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.310
 yellow color of the rose and its 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.770
 Last step is to apply a glaze 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 transparent to seal your design 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.550
 and that their decoration lasts for many days 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.830
 I hope you liked this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.740
 Nail decoration and make it 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.870

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.700

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.700
