00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
number four and today I'm going to be

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.280 
number four and today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:04.230> about<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.980> last<00:00:05.549> combos<00:00:06.029> and

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
talking about the last combos and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.780 
talking about the last combos and
engineer<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.440> my<00:00:07.560> opinion<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.340> master<00:00:08.760> of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
engineer in my opinion is the master of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.940 
engineer in my opinion is the master of
class<00:00:09.059> combos<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.960> might<00:00:10.139> say<00:00:10.410> elementalists

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
class combos you might say elementalists

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.280 
class combos you might say elementalists
have<00:00:11.250> more<00:00:11.580> blast<00:00:11.880> finishes<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.540> that's<00:00:12.960> true

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
have more blast finishes and that's true

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
have more blast finishes and that's true
but<00:00:14.040> engineers<00:00:14.759> also<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> lot<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
but engineers also have a lot of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.330 
but engineers also have a lot of
important<00:00:16.230> fields<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.680> combine<00:00:17.070> them<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
important fields to combine them and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
important fields to combine them and
they<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.510> really<00:00:18.840> neat

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
they can just get some really neat

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
they can just get some really neat
little<00:00:19.289> effects<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.279> before<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.300> go

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
little effects out of it and before I go

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
little effects out of it and before I go
more<00:00:21.930> into<00:00:22.080> detail<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
more into detail I'm just going to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.880 
more into detail I'm just going to

are<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.400> game<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.840> different

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
are in this game so we have different

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
are in this game so we have different
fields<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.730> lay<00:00:29.880> down<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
fields that we can lay down on the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.100 
fields that we can lay down on the
ground<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.859> finishes<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.070> combined<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:33.110> do

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
ground and finishes and combined they do

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
ground and finishes and combined they do
certain<00:00:34.739> effects<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.059> example

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
certain effects so we have for example

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.200 
certain effects so we have for example
the<00:00:36.660> fire<00:00:36.899> filled<00:00:37.440> water<00:00:38.190> filled<00:00:38.579> dark<00:00:38.879> field

light<00:00:39.510> field<00:00:39.840> etc<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.160> blessed<00:00:41.579> finishes

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
light field etc we have blessed finishes

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.479 
light field etc we have blessed finishes
projectile<00:00:42.840> finishers<00:00:43.410> world<00:00:43.770> finishers<00:00:44.309> and

though so the bomb kid already offers

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
though so the bomb kid already offers
two<00:01:12.090> different<00:01:12.119> fields<00:01:12.780> firefield<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> smoke

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
two different fields firefield and smoke

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
two different fields firefield and smoke
filled<00:01:14.189> those<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.090> important<00:01:15.720> ones

the fire field it gives you three stacks

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.380 
the fire field it gives you three stacks
of<00:01:52.290> might<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:53.070> 25<00:01:53.640> seconds<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.210> glass

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of might for 25 seconds when you glass

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
of might for 25 seconds when you glass
into<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.049> i'm<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> show<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
into it and i'm going to show you the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800 
into it and i'm going to show you the
normal<00:01:56.250> combo<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> i<00:01:56.700> usually<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
normal combo that i usually use you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
normal combo that i usually use you
later<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> big<00:01:58.439> bomb<00:01:58.680> first<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.280> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
later on the big bomb first because it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
later on the big bomb first because it
needs<00:01:59.549> three<00:01:59.820> seconds<00:02:00.210> until<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.600> actually

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
needs three seconds until it actually

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.109 
needs three seconds until it actually
blows<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.159> lay<00:02:02.399> down<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> field

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
blows up and then you lay down the field

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
blows up and then you lay down the field
so<00:02:03.899> let's<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
so let's do this and then you use the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.970 
so let's do this and then you use the
healing<00:02:06.030> turd<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.439> shoes

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
healing turd well that up and your shoes

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.400 
healing turd well that up and your shoes
that's<00:02:08.550> three<00:02:08.910> blasts<00:02:09.450> finishes<00:02:09.930> very<00:02:10.170> easy

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's three blasts finishes very easy

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.980 
that's three blasts finishes very easy
to<00:02:10.650> do<00:02:10.860> very<00:02:11.340> quick<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.850> do<00:02:12.140> 25<00:02:13.140> stacks<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.560> mud

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
to do very quick to do 25 stacks of mud

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.780 
to do very quick to do 25 stacks of mud
49<00:02:15.990> sex<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.350> my<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.680> 25<00:02:17.010> seconds<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.520> sorry

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
49 sex of my for 25 seconds I'm sorry

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.480 
49 sex of my for 25 seconds I'm sorry
and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.720> AoE<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.200> well<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.920> use<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
and it's AoE as well so you can use that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.000 
and it's AoE as well so you can use that
to<00:02:20.730> prepare<00:02:21.360> yourself<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> big<00:02:22.380> fight<00:02:22.680> and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to prepare yourself for a big fight and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.350 
to prepare yourself for a big fight and
PVE<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.050> PvP<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.360> yeah

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
PVE as well but also in PvP and yeah

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.000 
PVE as well but also in PvP and yeah
it's<00:02:27.510> especially<00:02:27.990> useful<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.830> for

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's especially useful just for

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.560 
it's especially useful just for
preparation<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.880> also<00:02:30.000> use<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
preparation you can also use it in the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.020 
preparation you can also use it in the
middle<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.020> fight<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.530> pvp<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.100> only<00:02:32.460> use<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
middle of a fight and pvp I only use it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.670 
middle of a fight and pvp I only use it
if<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.360> need<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.600> unpack<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:34.080> someone<00:02:34.410> really

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
if I need to unpack or someone really

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
if I need to unpack or someone really
badly<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.250> need<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.460> lot<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> my<00:02:35.940> techs<00:02:36.270> to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
badly and I need a lot of my techs to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.900 
badly and I need a lot of my techs to
just<00:02:36.600> deal<00:02:36.780> extra<00:02:37.020> damage<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.580> general

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
just deal extra damage but in general

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.790 
just deal extra damage but in general
that's<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.630> weakest<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.020> those<00:02:40.350> fields<00:02:40.740> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
that's the weakest of those fields that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's the weakest of those fields that
I'm<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.280> talking<00:02:41.460> about<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.120> still

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I'm going to be talking about but still

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.230 
I'm going to be talking about but still
pretty<00:02:43.050> useful<00:02:43.410> sometimes<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.910> before<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
pretty useful sometimes but before I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.790 
pretty useful sometimes but before I
continue<00:02:45.480> talking<00:02:46.020> about<00:02:46.050> other<00:02:46.380> foods<00:02:46.680> i'm

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
continue talking about other foods i'm

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.290 
continue talking about other foods i'm
just<00:02:46.980> going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> explain<00:02:47.670> real<00:02:47.940> quick<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
just going to explain real quick how the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.480 
just going to explain real quick how the
priority<00:02:49.080> system<00:02:49.320> works<00:02:49.770> hmm<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:52.010> if<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.340> lay

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
priority system works hmm so if you lay

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.040 
priority system works hmm so if you lay
down<00:02:53.520> if<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.270> different<00:02:54.450> fields<00:02:54.870> on

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
down if you have two different fields on

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.200 
down if you have two different fields on
top<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.440> each<00:02:55.560> other<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.400> first<00:02:56.730> one<00:02:57.000> will

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
top of each other the first one will

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.010 
top of each other the first one will
always<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.170> one<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.770> pass<00:02:58.980> into

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
always be the one that you can pass into

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.140 
always be the one that you can pass into
so<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.050> laid<00:03:01.590> down<00:03:01.650> two<00:03:02.610> different<00:03:02.730> fields

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
so I laid down two different fields

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.030 
so I laid down two different fields
there<00:03:03.360> lay<00:03:03.690> down<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.020> fire<00:03:04.200> field<00:03:04.440> first<00:03:04.710> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
there lay down the fire field first and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.810 
there lay down the fire field first and
I<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.940> three<00:03:06.210> nights<00:03:06.390> legs<00:03:07.820> that's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
I got the three nights legs that's

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.300 
I got the three nights legs that's
important<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.450> know<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.040> next<00:03:11.250> thing

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
important to know but the next thing

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.800 
important to know but the next thing
that<00:03:11.460> I'm<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.030> talking<00:03:12.180> about<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that I'm going to be talking about is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
that I'm going to be talking about is
the<00:03:12.959> smoke-filled<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.950> gives<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.490> three

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the smoke-filled it gives you three

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.210 
the smoke-filled it gives you three
seconds<00:03:15.180> or<00:03:15.330> two<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:15.990> two<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.620> three<00:03:16.890> seconds

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
seconds or two on two to three seconds

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.580 
seconds or two on two to three seconds
I'm<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.430> exactly<00:03:17.760> sure<00:03:18.050> what<00:03:19.050> number<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.470> is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
I'm not exactly sure what number it is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.220 
I'm not exactly sure what number it is
but<00:03:19.980> two<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.220> three<00:03:20.430> seconds<00:03:20.760> stealth<00:03:21.030> aue<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.020 
but two to three seconds stealth aue and
it's<00:03:22.470> very<00:03:22.800> very<00:03:23.100> powerful<00:03:23.280> because<00:03:23.580> stealth

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
it's very very powerful because stealth

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.000 
it's very very powerful because stealth
is<00:03:24.209> very<00:03:24.600> strong<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.200> game<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.770> can't

is very strong in this game you can't
get<00:03:26.220> hit<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.760> stealth<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.140> use

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
get hit out of stealth and you can use

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.690 
get hit out of stealth and you can use
it<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.500> reposition<00:03:28.920> yourself<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.550> use

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
it to reposition yourself you can use

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
reach read you can use it to stealth

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.240 
reach read you can use it to stealth
allies<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.260> they're<00:03:37.470> getting<00:03:37.830> stormed

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
allies if they're getting stormed

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.280 
allies if they're getting stormed
because<00:03:38.580> stealth<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.390> allies<00:03:39.810> can't<00:03:40.110> be

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
because stealth and allies can't be

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.460 
because stealth and allies can't be
stormed<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.130> very<00:03:41.340> very<00:03:41.760> powerful<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.959> you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
stormed it's very very powerful so you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.080 
stormed it's very very powerful so you
can<00:03:43.590> later<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.920> big<00:03:44.100> bump<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
can later on a big bump here it's the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.600 
can later on a big bump here it's the
same<00:03:45.270> combo<00:03:45.600> again<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.140> bam<00:03:46.770> this<00:03:47.250> combo

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
same combo again and bam this combo

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.970 
same combo again and bam this combo
again<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.780> six<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.830> eight

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
again and we have like six to eight

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.900 
again and we have like six to eight
seconds<00:03:50.489> um<00:03:51.110> stealth<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:53.370> allows<00:03:53.610> us<00:03:53.640> to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
seconds um stealth and that allows us to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.220 
seconds um stealth and that allows us to
move<00:03:54.030> around<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.390> little<00:03:54.480> bit<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.810> also<00:03:55.020> helps

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
move around a little bit it also helps

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.070 
move around a little bit it also helps
our<00:03:55.320> allies<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.800> very<00:03:55.980> useful<00:03:56.810> most<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
our allies it's very useful most of the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.040 
our allies it's very useful most of the
time<00:03:58.700> for<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.880> middle<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.300> fight<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.750> just

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
time for the middle of the fight I just

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.229 
time for the middle of the fight I just
use<00:04:01.320> my<00:04:01.350> smoke<00:04:01.860> finisher<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.610> my<00:04:02.760> shield<00:04:02.970> for

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
use my smoke finisher and my shield for

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.300 
use my smoke finisher and my shield for
that's<00:04:03.810> super<00:04:04.140> quick<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.470> do<00:04:04.620> also<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
that's super quick to do also the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.560 
that's super quick to do also the
healing<00:04:05.610> turret<00:04:05.820> works<00:04:06.030> pretty<00:04:06.270> well<00:04:06.390> for

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
healing turret works pretty well for

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.360 
healing turret works pretty well for
that<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:07.080> also<00:04:07.260> super<00:04:07.500> quick<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
that it's also super quick to do and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.660 
that it's also super quick to do and
just<00:04:09.150> as<00:04:09.270> I<00:04:09.390> said<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.739> watch<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.400> healing

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
just as I said it the watch the healing

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.979 
just as I said it the watch the healing
turret<00:04:11.850> gives<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.090> water-filled<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.810> since

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
turret gives a water-filled but since

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.960 
turret gives a water-filled but since
the<00:04:13.140> smoke-filled<00:04:13.530> will<00:04:13.800> be<00:04:13.920> there<00:04:14.130> first<00:04:14.430> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the smoke-filled will be there first you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.590 
the smoke-filled will be there first you
can<00:04:15.150> use<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.510> as<00:04:15.690> well<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.440> get<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:17.600> stealth

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
can use that as well to get a stealth

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.319 
can use that as well to get a stealth
out<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.900> it

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
out of it

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.230 
out of it
here<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.900> go<00:04:20.079> very<00:04:21.039> useful<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.759> helps<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> to

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
here you go very useful it helps you to

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.230 
here you go very useful it helps you to
reposition<00:04:22.659> yourself<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:24.370> try<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.699> use<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.150> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
reposition yourself just try to use it a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.059 
reposition yourself just try to use it a
little<00:04:25.389> bit<00:04:25.539> more<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:25.810> PvP<00:04:26.229> it's<00:04:26.379> very<00:04:26.800> very

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
little bit more in PvP it's very very

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.709 
little bit more in PvP it's very very
strong<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:28.240> makes<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.539> difference

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
strong and it makes the difference

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.390 
strong and it makes the difference
between<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.199> good<00:04:29.289> engineer<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.099> a<00:04:30.159> great

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
between a good engineer and a great

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.420 
between a good engineer and a great
engineer<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.289> let's<00:04:32.680> talk<00:04:32.889> about<00:04:33.039> the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
engineer so and let's talk about the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.300 
engineer so and let's talk about the
water<00:04:34.210> combo<00:04:34.659> real<00:04:34.840> quick<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.560> water<00:04:35.979> come

get 1.3 k extra healing but it also has
20<00:04:47.229> seconds<00:04:47.560> cooldown<00:04:47.770> most<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.639> time<00:04:48.819> you

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
20 seconds cooldown most of the time you

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.249 
20 seconds cooldown most of the time you
should<00:04:49.030> pick<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.449> up<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.689> I'm<00:04:49.810> going<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.139> do

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
should pick it up and I'm going to do

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.959 
should pick it up and I'm going to do
another<00:04:50.530> daily<00:04:50.949> on<00:04:51.069> that<00:04:51.250> as<00:04:51.370> well<00:04:51.550> just

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
another daily on that as well just

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.330 
another daily on that as well just
explaining<00:04:52.479> how<00:04:53.379> to<00:04:53.409> use<00:04:53.650> healing<00:04:53.979> toward

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
explaining how to use healing toward

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.100 
explaining how to use healing toward
properly<00:04:55.319> but<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:58.000> can<00:04:58.150> also<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.780> lay<00:04:59.080> down

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
properly but you can also just lay down

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.809 
properly but you can also just lay down
your<00:04:59.379> big<00:04:59.560> bomb<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.490> do<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.699> normal

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
your big bomb and just do the normal

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.339 
your big bomb and just do the normal
combo<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.449> showed<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.719> few<00:05:01.990> times<00:05:02.110> earlier

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
combo that I showed a few times earlier

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.770 
combo that I showed a few times earlier
but<00:05:03.159> there's<00:05:03.400> also<00:05:03.550> another<00:05:03.729> quick<00:05:04.270> trick

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
but there's also another quick trick

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.629 
but there's also another quick trick
that<00:05:05.139> you<00:05:05.169> can<00:05:05.289> do<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.129> big<00:05:06.280> bump<00:05:06.460> has<00:05:06.610> a

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
that you can do so the big bump has a

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.119 
that you can do so the big bump has a
very<00:05:07.030> tricky<00:05:07.569> use<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.229> needs<00:05:08.379> three<00:05:08.680> seconds

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
very tricky use it needs three seconds

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.339 
very tricky use it needs three seconds
until<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.460> actually<00:05:09.550> blows<00:05:09.909> up<00:05:10.120> near<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.629> f1

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
until it actually blows up near the f1

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.320 
until it actually blows up near the f1
gives<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.680> water-filled<00:05:12.129> for<00:05:12.370> one<00:05:12.520> second<00:05:12.940> so

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
gives a water-filled for one second so
