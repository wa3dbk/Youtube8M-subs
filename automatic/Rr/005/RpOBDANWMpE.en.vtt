 before continuing with this video 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.840
 I want us to meet a challenge guys 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.850
 this is a challenge, it is not a goal nor is it 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 none of that is a challenge is to get to 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.450
 more than 500 I know that yes you can 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 guys and another little thing is that if they have 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.410
 Some doubt, communicate it to me in what 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.059
 is my twitter that will be in the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.730
 description that I will also send the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.860
 greetings I had promised at the end of 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.900
 video I'm going to send some greetings guys and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.610
 how can you win these greetings then 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.260
 just follow me on twitter and when I 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
 I put a publication of the first 30 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 retweets to those first 30 people who 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.650
 I say they are going to be the ones who are going to win 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.640
 the greeting at the end of the video and good 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.530
 guys now yes 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.570
 start and good guys will 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.370
 show what is the karma land map 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 and well the truth is super super 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.120
 great, the only thing I did was to do it 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.580
 infinite because the map basically 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 I was in a world or lhc and then I 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.050
 The only thing I did was to pass it on to what it is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.050
 an infinite world and then there are going to be 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.450
 little ones 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.670
 some small books for example with what 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.050
 that the biomes that came together but 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.880
 when guys the truth seems to me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.590
 which is super cool and good as they are 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 seeing is the world of karbala if you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.370

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.020
 basically what is ok guys and 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.400
 well here as you see is the castle of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.010
 beauty I think it 's the castle of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.840
 vegueta if it is the vegueta castle that 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.610
 the truth was very cool when I 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.490

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.510

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.110
