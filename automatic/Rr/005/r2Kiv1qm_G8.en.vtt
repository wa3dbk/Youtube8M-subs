lever here that closes closes the top

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.029 
lever here that closes closes the top
gate<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.810> I'll<00:01:33.810> leave<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:34.079> open<00:01:35.009> right

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
gate on there I'll leave it open right

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.080 
gate on there I'll leave it open right
now<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.490> allow<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.909> collect<00:01:37.909> same<00:01:38.909> thing
