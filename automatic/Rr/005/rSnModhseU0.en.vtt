00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
we need to make a few tweaks a ball you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.030 
we need to make a few tweaks a ball you
know<00:01:43.579> like<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> left

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
know like when I you know use the left

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.630

or<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> right

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
or the right

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
or the right
it<00:01:48.180> turns<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.689> quick<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> make

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it turns pretty quick but I want to make

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630 
it turns pretty quick but I want to make
a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.009> slower<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.430> it'll<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
a little bit more slower so it'll be a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.039 
a little bit more slower so it'll be a
little<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.360> easier<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> play

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
little bit you know it's easier to play
