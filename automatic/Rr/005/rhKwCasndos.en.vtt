adapt to the to the 7.15 excuse me 5.1
and<00:05:03.520> then<00:05:04.270> you've<00:05:04.480> got<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.900> DC<00:05:05.320> in<00:05:05.560> okay<00:05:06.190> so

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
and then you've got the DC in okay so

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.850 
and then you've got the DC in okay so
that's<00:05:06.610> for<00:05:06.790> our<00:05:07.120> AC<00:05:07.420> adapter<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.350> then

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
that's for our AC adapter and then

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.430 
that's for our AC adapter and then
here's<00:05:09.280> our<00:05:09.460> inline<00:05:09.790> controller<00:05:10.300> okay<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.170> it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
here's our inline controller okay so it

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.770 
here's our inline controller okay so it
gives<00:05:11.650> us<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.950> little<00:05:12.040> color<00:05:12.430> coding<00:05:12.940> color

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
gives us a little color coding color

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.440 
gives us a little color coding color
scheme<00:05:14.260> code<00:05:14.620> thing<00:05:14.980> so<00:05:15.250> red<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.730> max<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.270> on

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
scheme code thing so red is the max I on

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.840 
scheme code thing so red is the max I on
is<00:05:16.630> high<00:05:16.810> white<00:05:17.290> is<00:05:17.470> medium<00:05:17.920> blue<00:05:18.220> is<00:05:18.370> low<00:05:18.580> and

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
is high white is medium blue is low and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.720 
is high white is medium blue is low and
green<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.810> minimum<00:05:20.140> all<00:05:20.890> right<00:05:21.130> it's<00:05:21.610> not

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
green is the minimum all right it's not

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.880 
green is the minimum all right it's not
I'm<00:05:22.360> really<00:05:22.600> good<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:23.020> know<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.350> then<00:05:23.680> we<00:05:23.770> have

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
I'm really good to know and then we have

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.320 
I'm really good to know and then we have
a<00:05:23.920> little<00:05:24.160> volume<00:05:24.310> control<00:05:24.820> thing<00:05:25.060> right<00:05:25.300> here

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
a little volume control thing right here

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.920 
a little volume control thing right here
on<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.720> side<00:05:26.340> okay<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.790> then<00:05:28.030> over<00:05:28.720> here<00:05:28.750> Oh

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
on the side okay and then over here Oh

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.350 
on the side okay and then over here Oh
voice<00:05:29.380> volume<00:05:29.680> that's<00:05:30.340> nice<00:05:30.550> most<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.270> these

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
voice volume that's nice most of these

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.210 
voice volume that's nice most of these
I've<00:05:31.540> seen<00:05:31.780> only<00:05:31.930> have<00:05:32.200> on<00:05:32.440> off<00:05:32.770> but<00:05:33.100> this

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
I've seen only have on off but this

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.800 
I've seen only have on off but this
actually<00:05:33.400> has<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.730> volume<00:05:33.970> slider<00:05:34.390> for<00:05:34.780> that

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
actually has a volume slider for that

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.110 
actually has a volume slider for that
and<00:05:35.140> then<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.430> join<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.700> microphone

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
and then this is to join the microphone

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.390 
and then this is to join the microphone
on<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.390> off<00:05:37.840> just<00:05:38.230> right<00:05:38.290> there<00:05:38.680> okay<00:05:39.040> so<00:05:39.100> then

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
on and off just right there okay so then

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.680 
on and off just right there okay so then
you<00:05:39.520> can<00:05:39.700> press<00:05:39.910> each<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.270> buttons<00:05:40.390> and

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
you can press each of the buttons and

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.570 
you can press each of the buttons and
it's<00:05:40.810> color-coded<00:05:41.110> for<00:05:41.590> how<00:05:42.070> high<00:05:42.220> you've<00:05:42.400> got

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
it's color-coded for how high you've got

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.490 
it's color-coded for how high you've got
the<00:05:42.669> volume<00:05:42.970> very<00:05:43.180> cool<00:05:43.419> there's<00:05:43.960> your<00:05:44.110> xbox

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
the volume very cool there's your xbox

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.670 
the volume very cool there's your xbox
360<00:05:45.070> Jack<00:05:45.280> right<00:05:45.490> there<00:05:45.669> at<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.820> bottom<00:05:46.030> and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
360 Jack right there at the bottom and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.500 
360 Jack right there at the bottom and
now<00:05:47.680> let's<00:05:47.919> have<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.100> look<00:05:48.340> at<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.850> headset

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
now let's have a look at the headset

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.600 
now let's have a look at the headset
itself<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:50.470> first<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.950> all<00:05:51.070> I<00:05:51.130> should<00:05:51.280> figure

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
itself so first of all I should figure

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.150 
itself so first of all I should figure
out<00:05:51.790> which<00:05:52.630> way<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.990> goes<00:05:53.050> out<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.680> labels<00:05:53.830> are

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
out which way it goes out the labels are

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.830 
out which way it goes out the labels are
on<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.550> inside<00:05:54.700> here<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.390> can<00:05:55.540> see<00:05:55.570> that's

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
on the inside here so you can see that's

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.230 
on the inside here so you can see that's
the<00:05:56.020> right<00:05:56.350> earcup<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:57.130> I'll<00:05:57.220> just<00:05:57.280> put<00:05:57.580> like

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
the right earcup so I'll just put like

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.930 
the right earcup so I'll just put like
that<00:05:58.510> okay<00:05:59.410> so<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.740> adjusts<00:06:00.190> at<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.460> top<00:06:00.669> just

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
that okay so it adjusts at the top just

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.330 
that okay so it adjusts at the top just
like<00:06:01.060> most<00:06:01.360> headsets<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:02.080> it's<00:06:02.800> quite

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
like most headsets and it's quite

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.120 
like most headsets and it's quite
adjustable<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.870> can<00:06:05.080> be<00:06:05.260> adjusted<00:06:05.350> quite<00:06:05.830> far

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
adjustable it can be adjusted quite far

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.500 
adjustable it can be adjusted quite far
so<00:06:06.340> even<00:06:06.550> if<00:06:06.640> my<00:06:06.730> head<00:06:06.910> was<00:06:07.090> like<00:06:07.210> this<00:06:07.270> big

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
so even if my head was like this big

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.360 
so even if my head was like this big
then<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.110> would<00:06:08.230> fit<00:06:08.470> quite<00:06:08.680> comfortably<00:06:09.160> but

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
then it would fit quite comfortably but

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.920 
then it would fit quite comfortably but
I'm<00:06:09.520> probably<00:06:09.700> gonna<00:06:10.030> have<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.390> at<00:06:10.450> about<00:06:10.600> the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
I'm probably gonna have it at about the

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.200 
I'm probably gonna have it at about the
medium<00:06:11.740> setting<00:06:12.130> just<00:06:12.340> like<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.760> it's

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
medium setting just like that it's

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.720 
medium setting just like that it's
really<00:06:13.720> it's<00:06:13.960> kind<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.530> heavy<00:06:14.740> actually<00:06:15.520> is<00:06:15.610> my

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
really it's kind of heavy actually is my

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.370 
really it's kind of heavy actually is my
first<00:06:15.970> observation<00:06:16.600> but<00:06:16.750> I<00:06:16.780> guess<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.200> has<00:06:17.350> to

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
first observation but I guess it has to

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.990 
first observation but I guess it has to
have<00:06:17.650> some<00:06:17.860> weight<00:06:18.040> to<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.220> if<00:06:18.490> you're<00:06:18.880> going

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
have some weight to it if you're going

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.080 
have some weight to it if you're going
to<00:06:19.060> be<00:06:19.240> able<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.660> stuff<00:06:19.900> all<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.290> that<00:06:20.470> extra

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
to be able to stuff all of that extra

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.520 
to be able to stuff all of that extra
electronics<00:06:22.090> and<00:06:22.300> speaker<00:06:22.720> gear<00:06:23.169> inside<00:06:23.470> I

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
electronics and speaker gear inside I

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.080 
electronics and speaker gear inside I
mean<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:23.770> guess<00:06:23.979> there's<00:06:24.190> not<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.370> whole<00:06:24.640> lot<00:06:24.910> to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
mean I guess there's not a whole lot to

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.450 
mean I guess there's not a whole lot to
say<00:06:25.120> about<00:06:25.300> it<00:06:25.630> it<00:06:25.720> seems<00:06:25.960> pretty<00:06:26.260> pretty<00:06:27.160> well

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
say about it it seems pretty pretty well

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.219 
say about it it seems pretty pretty well
built<00:06:27.789> I<00:06:27.970> wouldn't<00:06:28.270> expect<00:06:28.360> it<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.840> break<00:06:29.050> if

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
built I wouldn't expect it to break if

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:29.790 
built I wouldn't expect it to break if
you<00:06:29.350> accidentally

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
you accidentally

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.020 
you accidentally
drop<00:06:29.949> it<00:06:30.099> off<00:06:30.190> your<00:06:30.310> desk<00:06:30.490> or<00:06:30.729> do<00:06:30.849> anything

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
drop it off your desk or do anything

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.450 
drop it off your desk or do anything
like<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.330> I<00:06:31.780> can't<00:06:32.440> figure<00:06:32.650> out<00:06:32.800> just<00:06:32.949> sort

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
like that I can't figure out just sort

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.430 
like that I can't figure out just sort
of<00:06:33.550> like<00:06:33.759> right<00:06:34.240> now<00:06:34.479> immediately<00:06:34.900> how<00:06:35.379> to

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
of like right now immediately how to
