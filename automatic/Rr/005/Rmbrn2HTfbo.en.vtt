show you how to wire one up and how to
use<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.450> works<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.629> well<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.140> personally<00:00:41.129> do

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
use it works really well I personally do

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.630 
use it works really well I personally do
it<00:00:41.700> myself<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.680> using<00:00:43.950> I'm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it myself but right now I'm using I'm

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
it myself but right now I'm using I'm
running<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.000> through<00:00:45.030> passage<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> doesn't

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
running it through passage so it doesn't

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.040 
running it through passage so it doesn't
sound<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> great<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.390> cut<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
sound that great but you cut out all the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
sound that great but you cut out all the
mids<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.350> highs<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> hear<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> bass

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mids and highs so all you hear the bass

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
mids and highs so all you hear the bass
it's<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.140> simple<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.770> need<00:00:52.920> two

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it's pretty simple you just need two

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.060 
it's pretty simple you just need two
stairs<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> first<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> guys

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
stairs to do it the first one I guys

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.290 
stairs to do it the first one I guys
Yamaha<00:00:56.899> natural<00:00:57.899> sound<00:00:58.140> HDR<00:00:58.710> 5440<00:00:59.579> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
Yamaha natural sound HDR 5440 it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.209 
Yamaha natural sound HDR 5440 it's
technically<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> would<00:01:01.199> say<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> 7.1

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
technically I would say it's a 7.1

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.179 
technically I would say it's a 7.1
channel<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.820> got<00:01:03.439> two<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> left

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
channel so you got two for the left

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.090 
channel so you got two for the left
channel<00:01:05.519> two<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.390> sub<00:01:07.140> left<00:01:07.470> sub

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
channel two for the right sub left sub

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
channel two for the right sub left sub
right<00:01:08.340> sub<00:01:08.909> woofer<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.450> center<00:01:09.860> it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
right sub woofer and a center it's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
right sub woofer and a center it's
pretty<00:01:11.100> easy<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.000> run<00:01:12.689> lines

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
pretty easy all you have to do run lines

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
pretty easy all you have to do run lines
to<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:14.310> input<00:01:16.189> like<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.549> mine<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.939> went

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to be your input like for mine I went

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.679 
to be your input like for mine I went
off<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.479> ipod<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.979> through<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> input

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
off my ipod you put it through the input

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.859 
off my ipod you put it through the input
and<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:22.409> side<00:01:22.680> you'll<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.869> your

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and in the back side you'll have your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.679 
and in the back side you'll have your
assemble<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.500> output

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.039 

so<00:01:29.689> if<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.020> hard<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.320> see<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.780> want<00:01:32.960> a

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
so if it's hard to see you want a

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.990 
so if it's hard to see you want a
subwoofer<00:01:33.470> output<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.189> have<00:01:34.610> monster

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
subwoofer output you I have monster

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.660 
subwoofer output you I have monster
cables<00:01:35.420> spliced<00:01:35.720> over<00:01:36.140> went<00:01:36.950> from<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.400> single

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
cables spliced over went from a single

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.999 
cables spliced over went from a single
to<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> dual<00:01:39.490> off<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:41.149> subwoofer<00:01:41.420> out<00:01:42.009> make

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
to a dual off this subwoofer out make

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.639 
to a dual off this subwoofer out make
sure<00:01:43.130> your<00:01:43.250> while<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.580> correctly<00:01:43.880> though<00:01:44.649> you

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
sure your while it correctly though you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.859 
sure your while it correctly though you
put<00:01:45.799> its<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.009> input<00:01:46.190> two<00:01:46.549> second<00:01:46.970> stereo<00:01:47.299> so

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
put its you input two second stereo so

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.930 
put its you input two second stereo so
you're<00:01:48.020> outputting<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.710> subwoofer<00:01:49.190> out<00:01:49.369> as<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
you're outputting the subwoofer out as a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.670 
you're outputting the subwoofer out as a
preamp<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.690> you're<00:01:51.289> putting<00:01:51.590> your

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
preamp and you're putting your

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.539 
preamp and you're putting your
amplifying<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.580> other<00:01:52.729> stereo<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
amplifying it with the other stereo and

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.490 
amplifying it with the other stereo and
you<00:01:55.549> hook<00:01:55.700> up<00:01:55.880> your<00:01:55.909> subwoofers<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:57.320> that's

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
you hook up your subwoofers to that's

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.520 
you hook up your subwoofers to that's
there<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:59.390> receiver<00:01:59.750> will<00:01:59.990> act<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.500> a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
there you and the receiver will act as a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.240 
there you and the receiver will act as a
same<00:02:01.460> way<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> car<00:02:02.030> amplifier<00:02:02.179> well<00:02:03.250> it'll

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
same way as a car amplifier well it'll

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.940 
same way as a car amplifier well it'll
give<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.149> power<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.659> subwoofers<00:02:06.140> acting<00:02:06.860> like

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
give the power to subwoofers acting like

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.300 
give the power to subwoofers acting like
an<00:02:07.100> amplifier<00:02:08.200> that's<00:02:09.200> pretty<00:02:09.500> much<00:02:09.619> about<00:02:09.800> it

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
an amplifier that's pretty much about it

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.660 
an amplifier that's pretty much about it
and<00:02:10.759> I'll<00:02:11.510> do<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> short<00:02:12.110> demo<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.709> can't<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.580> it

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and I'll do a short demo I can't have it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.340 
and I'll do a short demo I can't have it
up<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.910> loud<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.330> now<00:02:14.540> though<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.080> course

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
up to loud right now though of course

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.910 
up to loud right now though of course
it's<00:02:16.160> only<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.610> 9:00<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.000> morning<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.650> I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
it's only like 9:00 in the morning but I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.130 
it's only like 9:00 in the morning but I
figured<00:02:19.910> there's<00:02:20.090> demo<00:02:20.390> video<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> help<00:02:20.989> some

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
figured there's demo video to help some

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.780 
figured there's demo video to help some
people<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.519> simple

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
people out it's a really simple

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.650 
people out it's a really simple
procedure<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.630> how<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> it's<00:02:26.450> one

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
procedure and how to do it so it's one

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:57.000 
procedure and how to do it so it's one
of<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> easiest<00:02:27.019> ways<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.470> know<00:02:27.530> of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.350 

see<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.100> cuts<00:02:58.340> out<00:02:58.490> all<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.820> mids<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.270> highs

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
see it cuts out all the mids and highs

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.330 
see it cuts out all the mids and highs
so<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.050> have<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> base<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.220> have

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
so you just have the base if you have

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.120 
so you just have the base if you have
any<00:03:01.580> questions<00:03:02.420> any<00:03:03.260> problems<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.890> doing
