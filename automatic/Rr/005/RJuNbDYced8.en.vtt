00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Passport photos are with the photographer yes 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 really expensive at times 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.910
 with 15 to even 30 euros so would like 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.540
 I show today how your passport photos 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 You can easily create it yourself 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 start the video before we do so 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.680
 I would like to start showing you what 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 if all this is needed once 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.230
 camera 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 it does not matter if that is one now 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 professional SLR camera is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 or here I have this way too 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 a normal digital camera with a lot 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.410
 but that will also happen then, of course 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.360
 a tripod or just a self-built 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 tripod from cd stack books stacking etc 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 a chair for the person who 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 a relevance is photographed as 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.289
 background a computer around the pictures 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.230
 later still briefly to edit and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.020
 right to cut and just the printer 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.039
 to print later 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.620
 before we go right now with the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.629
 I would like to start photographing 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.080
 say what you actually observe 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.610
 Should you take a photo later 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 should note that the person 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 or her the one who 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.110
 photographed is a neutral 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.790
 facial expression means that means he should 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.119
 Do not look mad he should not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.830
 absolutely just laugh normally 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 neutral 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 the person who should be photographed 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.530
 in the lens so look directly at the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 Photo and eyes should be on one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 Being x-axis that is biometrically that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.290
 is meant the eyes have to quasi 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.530
 be on a line okay then we go 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.299
 sometimes to take pictures about so i have 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.070
 I have already prepared this here 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'll fix that with my games reflex 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.340
 show camera 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.290
 but that could be true with everyone 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 make normal digital camera 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.960
 there is no reason to 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.790
 worry then I have the stool here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.409
 put down where the person or 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.890
 or me later 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.020
 sit down to then photographed too 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.360
 become 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 besides I have myself here for the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 white background decided or even 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 the white wallpaper so i have mine now 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 camera placed me you placed 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.769
 before you know, of course, you sit up 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.019
 this hawker I am now in mine 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.810
 hand you have the photos I have 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.110
 the self-timer turned on and who 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.640
 trigger them hereby and first of all 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.580
 I will take two pictures now and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.650
 they show you then and then I show 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.209
 you have a little one 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.310
 improvement proposal but as already 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.769
 said how is she upright 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.500
 The shoulders are supposed to be a line 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.269
 Of course, the shoulders do not form 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 put together but on the right 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.799
 shoulder even possible and the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.049
 eyes should a line be the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.610
 person who takes the pictures of you 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.560
 this probably better on the camera 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:15.410
 but we can see it later 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:15.410
 balance afterwards my two photos 11 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 then we'll see the photo 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.069
 now the other picture of course 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.390
 I just made two around 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.230
 safe to choose 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.750
 you see now a problem and that is 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.390
 the left half of my face 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.970
 we can almost completely dark 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.330
 recognize nothing 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:55.720
 a little tip from me you can 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:58.540
 with aluminum foil and cardboard such a thing 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.030
 builds that reflects the light like here 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.900
 already seen in the video and throws that just 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.069
 light on your left face 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:13.180
 we try the tomb from photo and 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.459
 I think just this part as possible 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.840
 so that the light from here in my 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.840
 face is reflected 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.879
 on your view would have to pay attention again and 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:38.259
 just after that she is upright again 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:41.479
 So let's take a look at the picture 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.939
 and you already see the left one 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.409
 face half is rather 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.960
 we have a lot more here 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:52.689
 light in the picture and that's how it would be 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.689
 almost throughout as a passport photo
