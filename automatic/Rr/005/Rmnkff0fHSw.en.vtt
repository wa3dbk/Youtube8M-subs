had never really tried the blushes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.969 
had never really tried the blushes
because<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.990> seemed<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.470> powdery

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
because they just seemed really powdery

being<00:01:16.650> said<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:18.060> someone<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.750> Sephora

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
being said I have had someone in Sephora

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.789 
being said I have had someone in Sephora
try<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:20.040> skin<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.840> what

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
try it on my skin just to see like what
