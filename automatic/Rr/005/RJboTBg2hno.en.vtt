being discussed just a month or two

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.910 
being discussed just a month or two
after<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.940> attacks<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.110> sep<00:02:15.260> tember<00:02:15.440> 11th

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
after the attacks in the sep tember 11th

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.890 
after the attacks in the sep tember 11th

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you know that this was coming all along

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.390 
you know that this was coming all along
the<00:02:18.080> way<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.320> I'm<00:02:18.410> just<00:02:18.590> wondering<00:02:18.770> do<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the way and I'm just wondering do you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910 
the way and I'm just wondering do you
think<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.180> point<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.840> time<00:02:20.920> even

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
think that at that point in time even

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.520 
think that at that point in time even
though<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:22.730> were<00:02:22.790> telling<00:02:23.270> us<00:02:23.390> lies<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
though they were telling us lies that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.550 
though they were telling us lies that
there<00:02:24.710> was<00:02:24.830> still<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.220> know<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.340> core<00:02:25.730> group<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
there was still you know a core group of

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.900 
there was still you know a core group of
Americans<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.800> would<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.250> decided<00:02:28.880> that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
Americans that would have decided that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.460 
Americans that would have decided that
you<00:02:29.090> know<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.390> worth<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.050> whatever<00:02:30.230> it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
you know it's worth it to do whatever it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.050 
you know it's worth it to do whatever it
takes<00:02:30.770> even<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.790> going<00:02:31.970> after

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
takes even if it's not just going after

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.210 
takes even if it's not just going after
Osama<00:02:32.420> bin<00:02:32.660> Laden<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.590> rock<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.980> whatever

you<00:02:34.370> need<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.610> retaliate<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:36.200> know

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
you need to retaliate and you know

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.230 
you need to retaliate and you know
whether<00:02:36.560> that's<00:02:36.830> changed<00:02:37.520> at<00:02:37.850> all<00:02:37.970> now

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
whether that's changed at all now

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360 
whether that's changed at all now
whether<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.870> know<00:02:38.990> two<00:02:39.050> wars<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.950> ten<00:02:40.340> years

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
whether you know two wars and ten years

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.710 
whether you know two wars and ten years
later<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:41.480> core<00:02:41.780> group<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:42.170> still<00:02:42.260> there<00:02:42.560> I

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
later that core group is still there I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.940 
later that core group is still there I
think<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.870> core<00:02:45.380> group<00:02:45.410> has

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
think that that core group has

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.880 
think that that core group has
absolutely<00:02:46.670> changed<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:48.230> important<00:02:48.800> to

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
absolutely changed I it's important to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.210 
absolutely changed I it's important to
remember<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.450> before<00:02:50.450> we<00:02:50.600> invaded<00:02:50.959> Iraq

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
remember that before we invaded Iraq

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.010 
remember that before we invaded Iraq
there<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> lot<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.670> misinformation<00:02:53.120> that

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
there was a lot of misinformation that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.560 
there was a lot of misinformation that
was<00:02:54.530> basically<00:02:55.220> spread<00:02:56.000> by<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.360> Bush

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
documents up there but you know we spoke

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.279 
documents up there but you know we spoke
about<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.800> fact<00:05:22.039> that<00:05:22.189> perhaps<00:05:23.289> Americans

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
about the fact that perhaps Americans

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.350 
about the fact that perhaps Americans
perhaps<00:05:24.949> we<00:05:25.189> shouldn't<00:05:25.490> be<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:25.819> surprised

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.360 
perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised
that<00:05:26.539> really<00:05:26.900> he<00:05:27.080> was<00:05:27.199> unapologetic<00:05:27.620> but<00:05:28.279> what

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
that really he was unapologetic but what

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.159 
that really he was unapologetic but what
do<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.520> think<00:05:28.759> that<00:05:28.909> it<00:05:29.000> would<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.270> meant<00:05:29.509> to

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.499 
do you think that it would have meant to
the<00:05:30.500> rest<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.949> world<00:05:31.129> specifically<00:05:32.120> you

one thing that I I will never forget is

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.869 
one thing that I I will never forget is
when<00:06:27.050> Obama<00:06:27.590> said<00:06:27.949> that<00:06:28.129> it<00:06:28.220> was<00:06:28.310> important<00:06:28.819> to

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
when Obama said that it was important to

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.990 
when Obama said that it was important to
have<00:06:29.440> conversations<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.710> discussions<00:06:31.000> with

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
leaders in the Middle East so you can

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.649 
leaders in the Middle East so you can
really<00:06:33.949> hone<00:06:34.310> in<00:06:34.550> on<00:06:34.789> what<00:06:34.909> their<00:06:35.330> intentions

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
really hone in on what their intentions

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.960 
really hone in on what their intentions
are<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.080> you<00:06:36.289> can<00:06:36.470> build<00:06:36.740> diplomatic<00:06:37.729> ties

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
are and you can build diplomatic ties

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.969 
are and you can build diplomatic ties
and<00:06:38.360> I<00:06:38.629> remember<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.139> right<00:06:39.319> wing<00:06:39.560> was<00:06:39.800> like

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
and I remember the right wing was like

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.010 
and I remember the right wing was like
no<00:06:40.400> don't<00:06:40.940> do<00:06:41.180> that<00:06:41.330> that's<00:06:41.539> crazy<00:06:41.840> you're

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
no don't do that that's crazy you're

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.869 
no don't do that that's crazy you're
talking<00:06:42.440> to<00:06:42.530> the<00:06:42.620> enemy<00:06:42.979> right<00:06:43.580> you<00:06:43.699> don't

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:43.879 
talking to the enemy right you don't

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.040 
talking to the enemy right you don't
want<00:06:44.030> to<00:06:44.090> do<00:06:44.180> that<00:06:44.210> so<00:06:44.479> that's<00:06:44.629> why<00:06:44.840> people

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
want to do that so that's why people

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.899 
want to do that so that's why people
like<00:06:45.289> Rumsfeld<00:06:45.830> would<00:06:46.009> never<00:06:46.250> apologize<00:06:46.520> for

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
like Rumsfeld would never apologize for

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.119 
like Rumsfeld would never apologize for
the<00:06:47.300> interrogation<00:06:47.930> methods<00:06:48.319> and<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.560> things

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
the interrogation methods and the things

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.879 
the interrogation methods and the things
that<00:06:49.280> he<00:06:49.370> did<00:06:49.520> wrong<00:06:50.379> during<00:06:51.379> his<00:06:51.500> term<00:06:51.680> with

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
that he did wrong during his term with

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.219 
that he did wrong during his term with
the<00:06:51.919> Bush<00:06:52.129> administration<00:06:52.870> but<00:06:53.870> that's<00:06:54.020> also

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
the Bush administration but that's also

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.930 
the Bush administration but that's also
perhaps<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.830> guess<00:06:54.979> why<00:06:55.250> you<00:06:55.310> know<00:06:55.669> this

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
perhaps I guess why you know this

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.689 
perhaps I guess why you know this
arrogant<00:06:56.919> unapologetic<00:06:57.919> view<00:06:58.190> is<00:06:58.430> now

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
arrogant unapologetic view is now

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.249 
arrogant unapologetic view is now
unfortunately<00:06:59.030> you<00:06:59.389> know<00:06:59.509> placed<00:06:59.780> upon<00:07:00.050> so

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
unfortunately you know placed upon so

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.740
