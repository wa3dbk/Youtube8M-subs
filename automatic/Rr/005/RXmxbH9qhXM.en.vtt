on<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.090> end<00:00:34.239> here<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:35.469> a<00:00:35.500> custom-built

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
on the end here that is a custom-built

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.299 
on the end here that is a custom-built
lens<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:38.410> this<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.710> snapped<00:00:38.949> onto<00:00:39.219> the

lens that when this is snapped onto the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.459 
lens that when this is snapped onto the
back<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.699> iPhone<00:00:39.820> gives<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.840> 360

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
back of the iPhone gives you a 360

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.380 
back of the iPhone gives you a 360
degree<00:00:42.039> view<00:00:42.070> it's<00:00:42.609> pretty<00:00:42.820> unique<00:00:42.969> pretty

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
degree view it's pretty unique pretty

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.840 
degree view it's pretty unique pretty
weird<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:44.590> let's<00:00:45.100> just<00:00:45.340> take<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.609> for<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.820> spin

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
weird so let's just take it for a spin

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.420 
weird so let's just take it for a spin
in<00:00:46.629> order<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:46.989> use<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.440> you<00:00:47.469> have<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.920> snap<00:00:48.250> it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
in order to use it you have to snap it

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.729 
in order to use it you have to snap it
on<00:00:48.609> to<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.120> iPhone<00:00:49.269> itself<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.350> snaps<00:00:50.590> on

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
on to the iPhone itself so it snaps on

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.910 
on to the iPhone itself so it snaps on
pretty<00:00:51.010> quickly<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.399> easily<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.109> now

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
pretty quickly and easily like so now

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.860 
pretty quickly and easily like so now
obviously<00:00:54.460> if<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.850> have<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.090> case<00:00:55.449> on<00:00:55.690> your

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
obviously if you have a case on your

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.060 
obviously if you have a case on your
iPhone<00:00:56.260> you're<00:00:56.469> not<00:00:56.590> really<00:00:56.769> going<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:56.980> be

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
iPhone you're not really going to be

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.270 
iPhone you're not really going to be
able<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.250> attach<00:00:57.550> this<00:00:57.789> too<00:00:58.000> easily<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.859> you're

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
able to attach this too easily so you're

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.590 
able to attach this too easily so you're
gonna<00:01:00.399> have<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.609> either<00:01:00.670> remove<00:01:00.910> your<00:01:01.179> case<00:01:01.390> or

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
gonna have to either remove your case or

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.350 
gonna have to either remove your case or
just<00:01:01.629> go<00:01:01.929> without<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.199> case<00:01:02.440> entirely<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:04.150> as

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
just go without a case entirely and as

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.970 
just go without a case entirely and as
you<00:01:04.449> can<00:01:04.510> see<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.870> covers<00:01:05.290> over<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.560> rear

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
you can see it covers over the rear

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.150 
you can see it covers over the rear
camera<00:01:06.220> unit<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.420> that's<00:01:08.380> about<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.560> snaps<00:01:08.980> on

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
camera unit and that's about it snaps on

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.670 
camera unit and that's about it snaps on
it's<00:01:09.670> all<00:01:10.000> plastic<00:01:10.240> but<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.870> is<00:01:10.900> pretty<00:01:11.440> firm

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
it's all plastic but it is pretty firm

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.050 
it's all plastic but it is pretty firm
on<00:01:11.860> there<00:01:11.980> doesn't<00:01:12.280> really<00:01:12.310> move<00:01:12.610> too<00:01:12.850> much

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
on there doesn't really move too much

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.930 
on there doesn't really move too much
this<00:01:13.870> lens<00:01:14.080> here<00:01:14.260> is<00:01:14.560> still<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.730> doesn't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
this lens here is still it doesn't

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.450 
this lens here is still it doesn't
rotate<00:01:16.810> or<00:01:17.140> anything<00:01:17.350> like<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.620> but<00:01:18.340> we'll

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
rotate or anything like that but we'll

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.620 
rotate or anything like that but we'll
see<00:01:18.580> what<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.760> effect<00:01:19.090> does<00:01:19.240> when<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.510> do

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
see what the effect does when we do

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.500 
see what the effect does when we do
actually<00:01:19.870> record<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.380> video<00:01:20.620> now<00:01:21.520> along<00:01:22.210> with

first thing that you see is this kind of
round<00:01:34.420> circle<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.080> you're<00:01:35.230> looking<00:01:35.440> through

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
round circle so you're looking through

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.750 
round circle so you're looking through
what<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:37.650> lens<00:01:38.650> is<00:01:38.860> seen<00:01:39.070> as<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.400> can<00:01:39.520> see<00:01:39.640> my

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
hand there and you can calibrate it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.970 
hand there and you can calibrate it
because<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.120> want<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.420> black<00:01:44.110> dot<00:01:44.410> here<00:01:44.440> to

cover up the round circle so that it's

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.140 
cover up the round circle so that it's
calibrated<00:01:47.140> properly<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:48.670> at<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.880> bottom

calibrated properly down at the bottom

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.520

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650

around now with the case on it the
iPhone<00:03:48.010> doesn't<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.550> flat<00:03:48.820> on<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> surface

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
iPhone doesn't like flat on the surface

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.000 
iPhone doesn't like flat on the surface
here<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.140> tilted<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.590> little<00:03:50.620> bit<00:03:50.800> so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
here so it is tilted a little bit so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.530 
here so it is tilted a little bit so
it's<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.220> little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.610> off<00:03:51.790> doesn't<00:03:52.420> look<00:03:52.510> that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
it's a little bit off doesn't look that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.120 
it's a little bit off doesn't look that
great<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.050> obviously<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.650> subject<00:03:53.950> matter

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
great and obviously the subject matter

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.710 
great and obviously the subject matter
is<00:03:54.250> not<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.580> interesting<00:03:55.090> but<00:03:55.510> if<00:03:55.630> you

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
is not all that interesting but if you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.940 
is not all that interesting but if you
do<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.989> something<00:03:56.200> more<00:03:56.440> interesting<00:03:56.739> to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
do have something more interesting to

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.510 
do have something more interesting to
look<00:03:57.160> at<00:03:57.370> like<00:03:57.730> say<00:03:57.910> you're<00:03:58.060> at<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.239> top<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.600> a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520

look at like say you're at the top of a
high-rise<00:04:00.520> building<00:04:00.550> or<00:04:02.250> top<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.400> roller

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
high-rise building or top of a roller

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.180 
high-rise building or top of a roller
coaster<00:04:03.700> if<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.270> dare<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.080> know<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.650> could

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
coaster if you dare you know you could

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.710 
coaster if you dare you know you could
probably<00:04:06.370> record<00:04:06.850> some<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:07.270> cool<00:04:07.480> video

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
probably record some really cool video

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.660 
probably record some really cool video
the<00:04:08.230> video<00:04:08.470> quality<00:04:08.650> itself<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.310> not<00:04:09.489> that

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
the video quality itself is not that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.390 
the video quality itself is not that
great<00:04:09.940> it's<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.690> bit<00:04:10.870> grainy<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.980> little<00:04:12.190> odd

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
great it's a bit grainy and a little odd

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.160 
great it's a bit grainy and a little odd
it's<00:04:13.180> not

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
it's not

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.210 
it's not
definitely<00:04:15.170> not<00:04:15.290> as<00:04:15.440> good<00:04:15.470> as<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:15.920> video<00:04:16.130> that

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
definitely not as good as the video that

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.820 
definitely not as good as the video that
the<00:04:16.490> normal<00:04:17.020> camera<00:04:18.020> captures<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.500> iPhone

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
the normal camera captures on the iPhone

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:31.060 
the normal camera captures on the iPhone
but<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.070> does<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.400> unique<00:04:19.760> feature<00:04:30.070> so

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070
