time starting with breakfast and give it
a<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.829> week<00:00:47.070> transition<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.059> each<00:00:48.180> meal

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a two week transition for each meal

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
a two week transition for each meal
the<00:00:49.230> second<00:00:49.649> reason<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.950> hitting<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> low<00:00:50.489> carb

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the second reason for hitting a low carb

the second reason for hitting a low carb
wall<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> thyroid<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:53.039> seems

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
wall has to do with a thyroid it seems

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
wall has to do with a thyroid it seems
like<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:53.730> people<00:00:54.360> making<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.190> rapid

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like in some people making a rapid

like in some people making a rapid
transition<00:00:56.640> from<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.899> carb<00:00:58.199> burner<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
transition from being a carb burner to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
transition from being a carb burner to
being<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> fat<00:00:59.309> burner<00:00:59.579> affects<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> thyroid

being a fat burner affects the thyroid

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
being a fat burner affects the thyroid
actually<00:01:01.590> tricks<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> thyroid<00:01:02.489> into

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
actually tricks the thyroid into

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually tricks the thyroid into
thinking<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> wintertime<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.199> time

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
thinking it's wintertime and it's time

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.679 
thinking it's wintertime and it's time
to<00:01:04.530> hibernate<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.700> even<00:01:06.060> though<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> may

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to hibernate and so even though you may
