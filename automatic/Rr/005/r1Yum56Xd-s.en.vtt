00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.289
 we are happy that this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 run milo is done us in a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.770
 of the most important runs that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.640
 made in the country by the number of 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.640
 participants 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.520
 in particular, I had to see the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.990
 run at 3 years that has been done in 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.090
 osorno and I've seen how people have 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.860
 answered the divine call 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.330
 I believe that each year they will leave 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.430
 increasing the number of people 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.440
 because everyone is realizing that 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.440
 the sport of what life is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.960
 it's a bit long but just because 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.369
 they would run a strong rise 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.740
 and run with friends the same super 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.710
 well it opened my eyes to give me 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.710
 mind that if I can and what we said 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.130
 a half of the year beyond 21 years 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.950
 I did not run, I was wandering, I wish 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.540
 I still do a lot of things because 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.740
 It is very entertaining and educational and there is more 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.740
 and I'm sleeping 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.770
 if I was a friend in the front I would give 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.170
 thank you for the motivation you give for 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 the different activities that it delivers and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.970
 helps fight sedentary lifestyle and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.900
 get out of the ordinary things that are 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.900
 present in cities 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.349
