00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.859
 Quality from China is possible today 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.230
 Become a lot of power tools in China 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 made appropriate factories 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.630
 are located mainly in the east of China 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the region around shanghai 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.190
 this city is today around 20 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 millions of inhabitants of China's future 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.210
 and will be according to beijing 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 promoted 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.010
 no wonder that many in shanghai 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.900
 European manufacturers and importers 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 The branches have also been founded 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.649
 German inspection organizations such as 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 example of the tüv are on the spot 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.649
 on the occasion of our current test of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 Mini screwdrivers we had occasion 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.089
 to visit the city of shanghai and the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.339
 tüv rheinland and the rooms of 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.190
 internationally acting importer 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.319
 to visit easily 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.319
 einhell operates a big one in shanghai 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.299
 well-equipped test lab around the front 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.499
 Place in order of production 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.499
 to be able to control directly 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.550
 We also had the opportunity 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.930
 one of the regarded as exemplary 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.170
 manufacturer to visit 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.760
 The Chinese manufacturer now 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.060
 produces about an hour's drive from 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
 Shanghai mainly gardening equipment 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.009
 electrically powered chainsaws 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 Grass trimmers and scythes as well as lawnmowers 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.320
 for us was already remarkable 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.490
 Showroom of this producer here 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.220
 many found themselves in germany 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.360
 well-known brand names among others 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.509
 attika einhell flomo gardena and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.220
 Mcallister this Chinese manufacturer 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.380
 also has a good one 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.930
 equipped test laboratory for monitoring the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.940
 production quality the technical 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.489
 equipment is partly different 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.680
 hardly from what we saw at the tüv 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.970
 had 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.840
 really worth seeing , however, was the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.760
 lasts from chain saws to a hall 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.470
 Manpower can be said here something like that 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.860
 would not really be in germany 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.860
 conceivable 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.150
 also a prototype production becomes 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.370
 offered 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 here you can use freis robots 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.200
 are prepared so that housing shapes 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.440
 handling and appearance of a planned 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.549
 Machine thoroughly tested in advance and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.549
 can be improved 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.580
 next door is the mass production 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.550
 prepared devices and 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.410
 tools for series production 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.540
 are made directly on site and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.290
 then we tested the production 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.840
 visit 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.820
 an unfamiliar picture for german eyes 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.100
 because here the work is not from 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.330
 machines but many diligent 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.330
 hands done 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.680
 Several ribbons stand in big ones 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.989
 production halls and the tools 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 various brands become providers 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.870
 wall on wall partly at the same time 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.870
 assembled 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.710
 We are complaining about product piracy 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.110
 now in a completely different light 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.390
 because of course it is not a problem here 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.060
 about the neighboring production for 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.090
 to inform another brand more precisely 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.130
 Especially in China with the preservation of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.150
 industry secrets are not all that 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.150
 strictly speaking 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.180
 that good quality is created here 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.370
 is quite clear to us 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.170
 But why German providers you 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.450
 detailed knowledge from innovation like that 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.310
 obviously revealing recklessly 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.310
 remains a mystery to us
