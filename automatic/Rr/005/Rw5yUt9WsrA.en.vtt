00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because I think this is a different kind

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.810 
because I think this is a different kind
of<00:00:31.769> video<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.219> was<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.790> a

okay<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.130> architecture<00:02:24.760> pieces

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
okay this is like architecture pieces

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.900

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
below like trying to write it out my

below like trying to write it out my
pronunciation<00:03:12.910> basically<00:03:13.329> means<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.840> just

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
pronunciation basically means it's just

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.110 
pronunciation basically means it's just
a<00:03:14.320> picture<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.040> shrinking<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.700> eye<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
a picture that is shrinking the eye and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.759 
a picture that is shrinking the eye and
a<00:03:16.480> lot<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.690> ways<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:16.989> can<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.739> by

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
a lot of ways you can do that is by

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.220 
a lot of ways you can do that is by
drawing<00:03:18.220> something<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.850> looks<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:20.140> like

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
drawing something that looks it's like

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.319 
drawing something that looks it's like
an<00:03:20.410> optical<00:03:20.860> illusion<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:21.370> lot<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.940> trouble

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
an optical illusion a lot of trouble

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.000 
an optical illusion a lot of trouble
well<00:03:22.450> drawings<00:03:22.930> are<00:03:23.110> done<00:03:23.350> where<00:03:23.650> they<00:03:23.680> look

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
well drawings are done where they look

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.920 
well drawings are done where they look
like<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.459> photograph<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.480> just<00:03:25.630> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
like it's a photograph so you just you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.789 
like it's a photograph so you just you
look<00:03:26.140> at<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.380> you're<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.560> wow<00:03:26.739> this

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
look at it and you're like wow this

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.710 
look at it and you're like wow this
photograph<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.430> actually<00:03:27.760> drawing<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.570> this

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
photograph is actually drawing so this

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.770 
photograph is actually drawing so this
is<00:03:28.900> my<00:03:29.110> Trump<00:03:29.980> Lowell<00:03:30.250> drawing<00:03:30.910> what<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> did<00:03:31.570> is

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
is my Trump Lowell drawing what I did is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.330 
is my Trump Lowell drawing what I did is
I<00:03:32.079> try<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.470> make<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.709> look<00:03:32.890> like<00:03:33.070> there's<00:03:33.250> a

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
I try to make it look like there's a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.880 
I try to make it look like there's a
hand<00:03:33.610> obviously<00:03:34.150> doesn't<00:03:34.420> look<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> real

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
hand obviously doesn't look like a real

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.180 
hand obviously doesn't look like a real
hand<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.549> mean<00:03:36.910> close<00:03:37.660> enough<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.440> i<00:03:38.739> drew<00:03:39.160> a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
hand but I mean close enough so i drew a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.690 
hand but I mean close enough so i drew a
hand<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.880> i<00:03:40.299> made<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.950> holding<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.100> sketch<00:03:42.549> of

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
hand and i made it holding a sketch of

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.270 
hand and i made it holding a sketch of
an<00:03:42.910> apple<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.320> like<00:03:44.410> half<00:03:44.650> done<00:03:44.980> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
an apple and that was like half done and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.699 
an apple and that was like half done and
it's<00:03:45.790> supposed<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.450> be<00:03:46.600> look<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.140> drawn

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
it's supposed to be look like it's drawn

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.740 
it's supposed to be look like it's drawn
by<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> different<00:03:48.370> hand<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.299> like<00:03:49.510> a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
by a different hand so this is like a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.470 
by a different hand so this is like a
model<00:03:50.470> holding<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.799> hand<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.370> our<00:03:51.609> apple<00:03:52.180> and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
model holding a hand but our apple and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.240 
model holding a hand but our apple and
then<00:03:52.630> someone<00:03:53.500> else<00:03:53.530> drying<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.840> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
then someone else drying it so that is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.660 
then someone else drying it so that is
my<00:03:57.250> little<00:03:58.380> optical<00:03:59.380> illusion<00:04:00.010> drawing<00:04:00.400> i

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
my little optical illusion drawing i

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.390 
my little optical illusion drawing i
just<00:04:01.000> did<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.329> like<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.660> few<00:04:01.870> weeks<00:04:02.079> ago<00:04:02.400> this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
just did that like a few weeks ago this

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.449 
just did that like a few weeks ago this
one<00:04:03.579> is<00:04:03.760> from<00:04:04.739> freshman<00:04:05.739> year<00:04:05.769> we<00:04:06.130> had<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.340> do

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
one is from freshman year we had to do

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.250 
one is from freshman year we had to do
this<00:04:06.579> okay<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.810> from<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.049> two<00:04:08.230> years

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
this okay so this is from like two years

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.680 
this okay so this is from like two years
ago<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:11.350> just<00:04:11.680> four<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.700> same<00:04:13.329> thing

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
ago and it's just four of the same thing

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.110 
ago and it's just four of the same thing
i<00:04:13.840> think<00:04:14.079> this<00:04:14.140> was<00:04:14.320> an<00:04:14.410> avocado<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.670> looks

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
i think this was an avocado it looks

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.270 
i think this was an avocado it looks
like<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> big<00:04:16.450> lump<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.080> we<00:04:17.830> had<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.099> do<00:04:18.250> for

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
like a big lump but we had to do for

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.879 
like a big lump but we had to do for
different<00:04:19.030> kind<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.479> um

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
different kind of um

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.469 
different kind of um
it's<00:04:21.009> like<00:04:21.159> drawing<00:04:21.699> technique<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.270> this<00:04:22.389> is

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
it's like drawing technique so this is

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.170 
it's like drawing technique so this is
blocking<00:04:23.129> stippling<00:04:24.129> which<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.729> in<00:04:24.879> dots

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
blocking stippling which is all in dots

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.580 
blocking stippling which is all in dots
which<00:04:25.479> takes<00:04:25.719> a<00:04:25.810> long<00:04:25.990> time<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.349> is<00:04:26.439> my

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
which takes a long time it is my

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.059 
which takes a long time it is my
absolute<00:04:26.740> favorite<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.490> do<00:04:28.499> cross<00:04:29.499> hatching

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
absolute favorite to do cross hatching

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.239 
absolute favorite to do cross hatching
or<00:04:30.310> sorry<00:04:30.610> cross<00:04:30.939> hatching<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.659> hatching<00:04:32.249> so

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.249 
or sorry cross hatching and hatching so

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.499 
or sorry cross hatching and hatching so
these<00:04:33.999> are<00:04:34.060> pretty<00:04:34.330> boring<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:37.180> kind<00:04:37.419> of

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
these are pretty boring but it's kind of

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.390 
these are pretty boring but it's kind of
cool<00:04:37.779> i<00:04:37.810> guess<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.469> I<00:04:38.529> really<00:04:38.620> like<00:04:38.949> stippling

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
cool i guess but I really like stippling

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.399 
cool i guess but I really like stippling
it's<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:39.729> fun<00:04:39.939> to<00:04:39.969> do<00:04:40.240> take<00:04:40.539> so<00:04:40.749> long<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.259> it's

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
it's so fun to do take so long but it's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.809 
it's so fun to do take so long but it's
so<00:04:41.560> worth<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:43.150> one<00:04:44.189> I'm<00:04:45.189> not<00:04:45.460> even<00:04:45.520> sure

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
so worth it this one I'm not even sure

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.519 
so worth it this one I'm not even sure
what<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.749> think<00:04:46.779> this<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.110> supposed<00:04:47.289> to

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:47.529 
what this is I think this is supposed to

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.969 
what this is I think this is supposed to
be<00:04:47.590> eggs<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.110> blanket<00:04:50.680> or<00:04:50.770> something

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
be eggs in like a blanket or something

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.519 
be eggs in like a blanket or something

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
all right thanks in a blanket this looks

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:54.929 
all right thanks in a blanket this looks
like<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.800> supposed<00:04:53.979> to<00:04:54.009> be<00:04:54.099> eggs<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.699> like<00:04:54.909> a

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
like it supposed to be eggs in like a

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.760 
like it supposed to be eggs in like a
cloth<00:04:55.569> or<00:04:55.840> something<00:04:56.050> i'm<00:04:56.469> not<00:04:56.620> really

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
cloth or something i'm not really

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.219 
cloth or something i'm not really
positive<00:04:57.460> on<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:58.020> this<00:04:59.020> one<00:04:59.469> i<00:05:00.629> did<00:05:01.629> this<00:05:01.990> was

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
positive on that this one i did this was

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.869 
positive on that this one i did this was
the<00:05:02.379> architecture<00:05:03.099> one<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.400> i<00:05:03.430> was<00:05:03.610> talking

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
the architecture one that i was talking

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.399 
the architecture one that i was talking
about<00:05:03.939> earlier<00:05:04.029> we<00:05:04.479> had<00:05:04.569> to<00:05:04.689> like<00:05:04.810> sketch<00:05:05.139> and

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
about earlier we had to like sketch and

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.189 
about earlier we had to like sketch and
then<00:05:05.889> we<00:05:06.189> had<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.400> choose<00:05:06.879> one<00:05:07.389> kind<00:05:08.110> of

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
then we had to choose one kind of

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.600 
then we had to choose one kind of
technique<00:05:08.529> to<00:05:08.680> do<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:08.979> either<00:05:09.099> blocking

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
technique to do so either blocking

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.610 
technique to do so either blocking
cross-hatching<00:05:10.150> hatching<00:05:10.779> or<00:05:10.930> stippling<00:05:11.439> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
cross-hatching hatching or stippling and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.100 
cross-hatching hatching or stippling and
you<00:05:11.680> guys<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:12.009> I<00:05:12.039> love<00:05:12.219> siblings<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.629> did

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
you guys know I love siblings so I did

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.670 
you guys know I love siblings so I did
stippling<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.159> this<00:05:15.639> is<00:05:15.909> my<00:05:16.300> building<00:05:17.259> that<00:05:17.650> I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
stippling and this is my building that I

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.980 
stippling and this is my building that I
decided<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.339> do<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:20.310> so<00:05:21.310> these<00:05:21.460> are<00:05:21.610> like<00:05:21.990> rock

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
decided to do and so these are like rock

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.159 
decided to do and so these are like rock
kind<00:05:23.379> of<00:05:23.499> things<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.069> like<00:05:24.189> a<00:05:24.219> checkerboard

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
kind of things and like a checkerboard

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.809 
kind of things and like a checkerboard
I'm<00:05:26.169> not<00:05:26.379> really<00:05:26.529> positive<00:05:27.099> on<00:05:27.219> what<00:05:27.400> oh<00:05:27.520> and

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
I'm not really positive on what oh and

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.219 
I'm not really positive on what oh and
this<00:05:27.909> also<00:05:28.089> had<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.419> be<00:05:28.509> in<00:05:28.599> perspective<00:05:29.110> which

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
this also had to be in perspective which

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.290 
this also had to be in perspective which
I<00:05:29.259> hate<00:05:29.620> perspective<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.520> much<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.939> takes<00:05:31.120> me

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
I hate perspective so much it takes me

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.579 
I hate perspective so much it takes me
so<00:05:31.360> long<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:31.779> do<00:05:31.870> because<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.259> just<00:05:32.319> can't

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589 
so long to do because I just can't

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:34.829 
so long to do because I just can't
really<00:05:32.770> think<00:05:32.919> of<00:05:33.099> how<00:05:34.029> to<00:05:34.089> do<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.479> right<00:05:34.509> I

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
really think of how to do it right I

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.550 
really think of how to do it right I
don't<00:05:34.990> know<00:05:35.050> I'm<00:05:35.110> not<00:05:35.199> really<00:05:35.319> good<00:05:35.469> at

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
don't know I'm not really good at

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.929 
don't know I'm not really good at
thinking<00:05:35.740> about<00:05:35.949> like<00:05:36.250> drying<00:05:36.490> it<00:05:36.669> in<00:05:36.789> Lake

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 
thinking about like drying it in Lake

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.279 
thinking about like drying it in Lake
perspective<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.449> care<00:05:37.599> about<00:05:37.689> this<00:05:37.960> was<00:05:38.110> three

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
perspective I care about this was three

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.510 
perspective I care about this was three
point<00:05:38.529> or<00:05:38.680> two<00:05:38.710> point<00:05:39.659> but<00:05:40.659> yeah<00:05:41.259> so<00:05:41.800> that's

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
point or two point but yeah so that's

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.459 
point or two point but yeah so that's
what<00:05:42.639> it<00:05:42.669> looks<00:05:42.969> like<00:05:43.270> just<00:05:43.599> all<00:05:43.779> done<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.199> dots

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
what it looks like just all done in dots

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.389 
what it looks like just all done in dots
but<00:05:44.979> I<00:05:45.039> think<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:45.580> cool<00:05:46.389> when<00:05:47.069> it's<00:05:48.069> finished

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:48.399 
but I think it's cool when it's finished

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.800 
but I think it's cool when it's finished
that's<00:05:49.060> my<00:05:49.210> little<00:05:50.399> architecture<00:05:51.399> drawing

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
that's my little architecture drawing

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.200 
that's my little architecture drawing
this<00:05:52.810> one<00:05:53.199> okay<00:05:53.620> these<00:05:53.800> are<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.159> on<00:05:54.520> 20

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
this one okay these are just on 20

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.600 
this one okay these are just on 20

actually this one morris's this is funny
this<00:05:57.789> is<00:05:57.849> just<00:05:58.149> a<00:05:58.240> random<00:05:58.569> horse<00:05:58.810> i<00:05:59.050> don't<00:05:59.289> know

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
this is just a random horse i don't know

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:06.179 
this is just a random horse i don't know
why<00:05:59.560> i<00:06:00.870> drew<00:06:01.870> a<00:06:01.899> horse<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.379> I<00:06:02.439> did<00:06:04.800> then<00:06:05.800> this

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
why i drew a horse that I did then this

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.490 
why i drew a horse that I did then this
one<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:06.399> my<00:06:06.639> absolute<00:06:07.240> favorite<00:06:07.810> this<00:06:08.020> is<00:06:08.259> an

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
one is my absolute favorite this is an

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.409 
one is my absolute favorite this is an
abstract<00:06:09.039> drawing<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.610> just<00:06:10.000> did<00:06:10.180> it<00:06:10.210> took

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
abstract drawing that I just did it took

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.959 
abstract drawing that I just did it took
me<00:06:10.539> so<00:06:10.719> long<00:06:10.750> took<00:06:11.110> me<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.259> few<00:06:11.349> weeks<00:06:11.469> to<00:06:11.649> do<00:06:11.969> but

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
me so long took me a few weeks to do but

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.800 
me so long took me a few weeks to do but
this<00:06:13.389> is<00:06:13.539> what<00:06:13.719> it<00:06:13.839> looks<00:06:14.139> like<00:06:14.409> finally<00:06:15.129> and<00:06:15.810> I

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
this is what it looks like finally and I

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.899 
this is what it looks like finally and I
did<00:06:16.839> it<00:06:17.050> in<00:06:17.349> like<00:06:17.589> contrasting<00:06:18.310> colors<00:06:18.610> extra

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
did it in like contrasting colors extra

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.420 
did it in like contrasting colors extra
jelly<00:06:19.060> like<00:06:19.210> blue<00:06:19.569> and<00:06:19.899> orange<00:06:20.289> I<00:06:20.680> think

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
jelly like blue and orange I think

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.860 
jelly like blue and orange I think
that's<00:06:21.580> really<00:06:21.849> pretty<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.270> then<00:06:22.389> purple<00:06:22.750> and

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
that's really pretty and then purple and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.829 
that's really pretty and then purple and
green<00:06:23.729> even<00:06:24.729> though<00:06:24.819> purple<00:06:25.479> and<00:06:25.569> yellow<00:06:25.659> are

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
green even though purple and yellow are

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.860 
green even though purple and yellow are
opposite<00:06:26.259> but<00:06:26.639> really<00:06:27.639> pretty<00:06:27.909> I<00:06:28.060> think<00:06:28.330> like

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
opposite but really pretty I think like

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.509 
opposite but really pretty I think like
the<00:06:29.050> colors<00:06:29.379> i<00:06:29.560> think<00:06:29.740> is<00:06:29.830> really<00:06:30.069> cool<00:06:30.219> took

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:30.519 
the colors i think is really cool took

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:33.839 
the colors i think is really cool took
me<00:06:30.639> so<00:06:30.819> long<00:06:31.740> that's<00:06:32.740> what<00:06:32.949> the<00:06:33.219> final<00:06:33.490> leg<00:06:33.759> is

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
me so long that's what the final leg is

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:34.710 
me so long that's what the final leg is
pretty<00:06:34.029> big<00:06:34.149> and<00:06:34.209> i<00:06:34.360> think<00:06:34.509> I'm

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
pretty big and i think I'm

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.080 
pretty big and i think I'm
put<00:06:34.870> this<00:06:34.990> up<00:06:35.170> in<00:06:35.260> my<00:06:35.380> room<00:06:35.610> above<00:06:36.610> my<00:06:36.760> vanity

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
put this up in my room above my vanity

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.540 
put this up in my room above my vanity
or<00:06:37.390> like<00:06:37.780> over<00:06:38.050> there<00:06:38.230> on<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.470> wall<00:06:38.590> do<00:06:39.490> you

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
or like over there on the wall do you

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.370 
or like over there on the wall do you
have<00:06:39.640> to<00:06:39.730> see<00:06:39.850> in<00:06:40.120> my<00:06:40.240> room<00:06:40.450> tour<00:06:40.660> when<00:06:40.930> I<00:06:40.960> do<00:06:41.050> it

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
have to see in my room tour when I do it

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.170 
have to see in my room tour when I do it
and<00:06:41.650> my<00:06:41.740> last<00:06:41.950> one<00:06:42.130> you<00:06:42.340> guys<00:06:42.490> have<00:06:42.730> seen<00:06:42.970> this
