were<00:02:36.560> areas<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:37.040> concern<00:02:37.460> so<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.000> first

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
were areas of concern so the first

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.980 
were areas of concern so the first
milestone<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.350> me<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:40.400> when<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:40.820> first<00:02:41.120> ran<00:02:41.570> a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
milestone for me was when we first ran a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.460 
milestone for me was when we first ran a
nozzle<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.920> included<00:02:43.610> some<00:02:44.090> pieces<00:02:44.780> made

possibly can we realized that we could

possibly can we realized that we could

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
could start combining pieces together

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.570 
could start combining pieces together
and<00:03:15.170> as<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:15.410> combine<00:03:15.830> one<00:03:16.040> piece<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.460> two

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580

and as we combine one piece and two
piece<00:03:17.200> we<00:03:18.200> moved<00:03:18.470> at<00:03:19.340> some<00:03:19.850> point<00:03:20.090> and

piece we moved at some point and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.240 
piece we moved at some point and
realized<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.080> we<00:03:21.260> have<00:03:21.380> 20<00:03:21.740> individual

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
realized that we have 20 individual

realized that we have 20 individual
pieces<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.820> perhaps<00:03:23.450> we<00:03:24.230> could<00:03:24.380> print

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590

them<00:03:24.710> all<00:03:24.890> as<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.520> that<00:03:25.970> was<00:03:26.150> really<00:03:26.570> the
