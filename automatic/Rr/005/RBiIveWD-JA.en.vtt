00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello people today I have one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 Do you want that so many spectators there 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.169
 wanted outside and I show 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.779
 you the products I use 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.410
 few little tips 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 I use all shampoo that will be all 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 intensive construction repair shampoo intense 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 build up shampoo sorry there I come but 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.019
 already with the first bad 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.820
 Message was sad when I heard that 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.809
 have 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.579
 In addition, I must now off and new 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.260
 Buy a car I'm second directly 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.379
 put in the supply but that is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 already my last escape and me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 I'm definitely going to have something on 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.680
 values ​​remain because I also have many 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.660
 More products Duncan has now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.670
 hopefully we'll show right away 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 counting 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 I use the albert riera as a conditioner 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 mask with avocado and ciabatta that is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.409
 not really a rinse but 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 actually her mask but that simple 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 richer and it actually has too 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.940
 the same effect a rinse and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.070
 that's why I'm happy with it 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.259
 we are a bit strained 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.240
 for example because I have been more 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.299
 and there as well, of course, the hair 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.119
 totally out then I still use 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.530
 in addition a hard and that is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 also alverde was surprise and indeed 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 it is the repair broken with avocado 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 and ciabatta and that is uncomfortable and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 if I have washed around the still 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.360
 I'm wet or wet 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.789
 Just let him know that on the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 hands spread it nice if we 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.080
 touch through the help want 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.799
 in the years are dry then they are 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.229
 nice and soft and johann a nice 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.070
 Feel and enjoy it 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.340
 have worked already then I have 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.299
 still a product of albert and mostly 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.430
 the moisture two-phase track 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.290
 I usually use the journal 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.940
 as long as this should not be this 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.440
 resisted on 1 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.330
 and that's why I'm always here 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 is after me mostly before I mean 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.659
 hair fruits very much with it a highly 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 my hair through so I knot no 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:41.060
 wash because of course not so 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 good and let it brush through 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 and are still maintained you just have to 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.659
 watch because it's somewhere 25 pm 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.129
 that one shakes the choice well 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.840
 of course my hair then with the complexion 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.450
 and know him since then certainly some 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.140
 of you there is not in the dm is 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.730
 very cheap costs 15 euros but it is 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.269
 Definitely worth it 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.239
 so that the hair pulling long I'm Us 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.140
 almost no other princes he 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.549
 because we are lying a lot 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.069
 if the men had one then 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.870
 bit too hard or me 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.019
 many of the sun or in the swimming pool or 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.090
 at the sea and I know hey neither am 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.489
 next morning from which the newspaper was 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.340
 then wash it out properly then do it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.760
 I have a cure the evening before and that 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.019
 I use coconut oil for that 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.849
 actually everywhere you should 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.430
 Watching that they might as to eat 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.970
 because he takes no materials, no other 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.440
 this is totally in here now 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.840
 versatile 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.190
 as a food for the skincare 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.050
 also super by the way to the skin 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.620
 einzucremen 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.940
 or stop for the hair and then take it 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 I think of it in my hands and 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.530
 It really only distributes it in the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.530
 Hair length hairspitzen and make me 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.930
 then well over night or I'll make myself 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.140
 in the whole days until the beginning is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.580
 Of course not too pretty but it 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.730
 really helps and the next morning 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.180
 really wash your hair and then in 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.750
 the moisture is no longer 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.519
 so brittle down at the tips can 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.740
 really only recommend since you almost 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.070
 really stupid that has really times 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.770
 really we knew already seen 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.540
 action a aria relatively clear not 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.010
 Climbed nothing but if I 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.460
 but want to relax or to the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.320
 Chain 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.390
 then, of course, one connects to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.660
 protection spray and this is from got to 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.200
 be of the spenders and what i like about that 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.390
 meet it is the last one the only one 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.419
 is what i could find 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.610
 what without silicone so all my 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.040
 Products are like silicones albert as well 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.720
 search 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.130
 and I pay close attention because silicones 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.280
 So the goal is to concentrate on each individual 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.460
 hair due and the see though but 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.160
 first with aushängen but still one 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.000
 a bit empty because the years the bother 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.830
 be with foreigners and secondly 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.620
 that also settle his ten of them 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.030
 years can be totally broken - 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.780
 silicone she is really just beautiful 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.940
 appearance 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.700
 but it is not really healthy 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.120
 that's why there's no silicone around that 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.390
 in all products not in it 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.150
 and then I'll get to the next one 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.090
 Point 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.910
 you really have to play that game 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 Men do not grow well over 60 to 100 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.860
 high and the hair breaks off and then 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.510
 You do not see her growing because of her 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.580
 namely can not be longer and 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.470
 I can only crash from time to time 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.930
 recommend if you really flow though 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.050
 you see that but have down and go 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.270
 To the hairdresser quickly or straps 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.860
 the sharp side was that I have 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.510
 already done and there I have one 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.270
 video this and I hear you 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.840
 down in the infobox 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.300
 that was my hair care routine and there 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.550
 I'll be another one soon 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.620
 Upload video with tips and tricks 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.480
 around the hair as I want my name 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.790
 to got just before my 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.420
 last hairdresser meanwhile against 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.700
 bit down from the last time why 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.920
 and I'm actually going to the relatively 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.590
 hairstyle so always when they are broken 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.010
 and I even have a holiday by the sea 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.940
 and they still have not fallen 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:41.500
 after he always breaks vacation 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.740
 but they are not fluid and the good ones 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.740
 a lot of 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.679
 then look forward to my next video 

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:51.239
 if it is out then I link everything 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:53.489
 Of course somehow still in the infobox 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.860
 so that you have the tips also pure 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:59.719
 can pull 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.719
 and then bye until next time
