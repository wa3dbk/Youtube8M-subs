00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
look at this and maybe we need to adjust

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070 
look at this and maybe we need to adjust
the<00:00:08.220> light<00:00:08.760> fog<00:00:08.970> itself<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:09.929> kind

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the light fog itself to have some kind

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.970 
the light fog itself to have some kind
of<00:00:10.200> special<00:00:10.500> effect<00:00:12.559> that's<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> get

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
of special effect that's going to get

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
of special effect that's going to get
starting<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.670> two<00:00:14.849> materials<00:00:15.240> which<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> going

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
starting in two materials which is going

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.830 
starting in two materials which is going
to<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.590> something<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> next<00:00:18.150> chapter<00:00:18.359> but

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to be something in the next chapter but

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
to be something in the next chapter but
I'm<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> go<00:00:19.560> into<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I'm going to go into a little bit of it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000 
I'm going to go into a little bit of it
now<00:00:20.730> let's<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.050> rendering<00:00:22.470> editors<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
now let's go into rendering editors and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.120 
now let's go into rendering editors and
go<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> hypershade<00:00:26.390> over<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.170> crate<00:00:28.710> Maya

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
go to hypershade over in the crate Maya

noise is my favorite because it has so
many<00:00:41.219> different<00:00:41.520> properties<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
many different properties that i can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.639 
many different properties that i can
change<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:44.570> there's<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:46.260> Billa

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
noise Perlin noise Perlin noise is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
noise Perlin noise Perlin noise is
awesome<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.680> skin<00:00:50.719> amazing<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:53.070> I'm

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
awesome for skin amazing so what I'm

awesome for skin amazing so what I'm
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.850> attach<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.199> noise<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to do here is attach this noise to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450 
going to do here is attach this noise to
the<00:00:56.190> light<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.530> do<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> by<00:00:58.859> clicking<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the light I do that by clicking on a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410 
the light I do that by clicking on a
light<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.890> direct<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.850> towards

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
light and then I can direct this towards

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
light and then I can direct this towards
either<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.960> color<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.460> light<00:01:06.299> spread<00:01:07.220> or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
either the color or the light spread or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.690 
either the color or the light spread or
the<00:01:08.400> fog<00:01:08.760> smart<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.280> click<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the fog smart so here if I click and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.810 
the fog smart so here if I click and
drag<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.030> over<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.540> fog<00:01:13.080> spread<00:01:16.520> now<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.790> i

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
drag this over to fog spread now when i

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
drag this over to fog spread now when i
render<00:01:18.299> i<00:01:23.060> get<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:26.000> ok<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.890> has<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
render i get this ok and it has a lot to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
render i get this ok and it has a lot to
do<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.509> noise<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.890> appearing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
do with the noise that's appearing

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.749 
do with the noise that's appearing
within<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> map<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.829> adjust<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> noise<00:01:35.520> i

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
within the map so to adjust the noise i

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
within the map so to adjust the noise i
can<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.060> click<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> map<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.409> could

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
can just click on the map and i could

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.969 
can just click on the map and i could
choose<00:01:37.619> anything<00:01:38.570> up<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> top<00:01:40.049> keep<00:01:40.829> in

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
choose anything up at the top keep in

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
choose anything up at the top keep in
mind<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:41.640> millions<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.540> different

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
mind you can make millions of different

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.280 
mind you can make millions of different
maps<00:01:43.020> using<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.340> noise<00:01:44.930> ok<00:01:45.930> especially

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
maps using just this noise ok especially

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
maps using just this noise ok especially
like<00:01:46.530> bump<00:01:46.829> maps<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.640> oh<00:01:47.880> yeah<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.840> goes

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like bump maps and oh yeah it just goes

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.370 
like bump maps and oh yeah it just goes
on<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.540> should<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on and on so what you should know is the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
on and on so what you should know is the
contrast<00:01:52.950> changes<00:01:53.579> everything<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
contrast changes everything so if the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.190 
contrast changes everything so if the
contrast<00:01:55.770> change<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:57.270> black<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> white

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
contrast change is from black to white

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
contrast change is from black to white
it's<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> harsh<00:01:59.850> change<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it's going to have a harsh change in the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
it's going to have a harsh change in the
light<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.350> black<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.740> gray<00:02:01.880> hardly

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
light but if it's black to gray hardly

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
light but if it's black to gray hardly
any<00:02:03.060> change<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.040> becomes<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> little

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
any change and it just becomes a little

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.180 
any change and it just becomes a little
bit<00:02:06.950> dimmer

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.530 

so<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> floor<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.239> see<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so now on the floor you don't see that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.949 
so now on the floor you don't see that
harsh<00:02:16.200> harsh<00:02:16.650> effect<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.180> but

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
harsh harsh effect that's going on but

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
harsh harsh effect that's going on but
you<00:02:19.230> definitely<00:02:19.470> see<00:02:19.860> all<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.849> streams<00:02:21.120> like

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you definitely see all the streams like

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.440 
you definitely see all the streams like
coming<00:02:21.690> down<00:02:21.830> notice<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.010> another<00:02:23.910> thing<00:02:24.270> about

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
coming down notice I another thing about

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.470 
coming down notice I another thing about
this<00:02:24.599> type<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> effect<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.850> looks<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.330> it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
this type of effect it looks like it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
this type of effect it looks like it's
affecting<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> floor<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:29.640> look<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> ball

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
affecting the floor but look at the ball

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.080 
affecting the floor but look at the ball
it's<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.170> affecting<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> ball<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.640> much<00:02:32.910> as

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it's not affecting the ball as much as

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.259 
it's not affecting the ball as much as
the<00:02:33.239> floor<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:34.400> that's<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> bad

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
the floor right that's one of the bad

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.140 
the floor right that's one of the bad
things<00:02:36.300> about<00:02:36.750> using<00:02:37.350> light<00:02:37.560> fog<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.190> some

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
things about using light fog and some

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.850 
things about using light fog and some
kind<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.450> special<00:02:39.660> effects<00:02:40.110> attached<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
kind of special effects attached to it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.059 
kind of special effects attached to it
is<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:42.269> optical<00:02:43.019> illusion<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.920> almost

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
is this optical illusion that it almost

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.280 
is this optical illusion that it almost
looks<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.819> ball<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.720> foreground

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
looks like the ball is in the foreground

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.640 
looks like the ball is in the foreground
and<00:02:47.209> then<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.510> light<00:02:48.660> fog<00:02:48.900> gets<00:02:49.080> else<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.500> in

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
and then the light fog gets else is in

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.350 
and then the light fog gets else is in
the<00:02:49.739> background<00:02:52.459> even<00:02:53.459> though<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.330> on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
the background even though it's right on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.550 
the background even though it's right on
top<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:59.450> okay<00:03:00.450> another<00:03:00.930> thing<00:03:01.049> they<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.470> be

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
top of it okay another thing they can be

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.770 
top of it okay another thing they can be
adjusted<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:04.280> frequency<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> i<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.660> make

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
adjusted here is frequency so i can make

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:16.220 
adjusted here is frequency so i can make
really<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.590> small<00:03:08.160> fine<00:03:08.700> dots<00:03:14.959> with<00:03:15.959> bill

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
really really small fine dots with bill

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.660 
really really small fine dots with bill
oh<00:03:16.380> i<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.829> lot<00:03:17.100> more<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.640> play<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.620> with

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
oh i have a lot more to play with with

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.460 
oh i have a lot more to play with with
Perlin<00:03:20.670> noise<00:03:20.700> not<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.750> much<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.870> i<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.140> random

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
Perlin noise not so much so i can random

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.180 
Perlin noise not so much so i can random
up<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> size<00:03:26.010> i<00:03:26.570> can<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:28.739> kind<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.980> RAM

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
up the size i can what kind of RAM

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.610 
up the size i can what kind of RAM
randomness<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.359> need<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:33.320> let's<00:03:34.320> see<00:03:34.470> what

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
randomness do I need and let's see what

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.340 
randomness do I need and let's see what
was<00:03:34.769> else<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.489> probably<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.239> good<00:03:37.140> thing

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
was else that was probably a good thing

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.130 
was else that was probably a good thing
to<00:03:37.500> know<00:03:37.530> there's<00:03:38.489> time<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.690> doesn't<00:03:40.019> do

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
to know there's time but that doesn't do

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.770 
to know there's time but that doesn't do
too<00:03:40.320> much<00:03:40.350> ah<00:03:42.049> right<00:03:43.049> here<00:03:43.320> color<00:03:43.739> balance<00:03:44.780> ok

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
too much ah right here color balance ok

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.039 
too much ah right here color balance ok
so<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.079> color<00:03:46.290> balance<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.859> can<00:03:47.040> state<00:03:47.780> does<00:03:48.780> it

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
so the color balance I can state does it

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.090 
so the color balance I can state does it
have<00:03:49.880> what<00:03:50.880> does<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.329> have<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.690> greater<00:03:52.500> change

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
have what does it have a greater change

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.199 
have what does it have a greater change
between<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.700> two<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:55.859> lower<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.609> down<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
between the two if I lower this down it

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:06.830 
between the two if I lower this down it
affects<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.019> actual<00:03:58.230> quality

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.530 

okay<00:04:08.129> so<00:04:09.129> play<00:04:09.730> around<00:04:09.849> with<00:04:10.090> those<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.269> little

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
okay so play around with those a little

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.830 
okay so play around with those a little
bit<00:04:11.459> again<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.580> could<00:04:12.640> tweak<00:04:13.299> those<00:04:13.480> all<00:04:13.690> day

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
bit again I could tweak those all day

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.210 
bit again I could tweak those all day
long<00:04:14.049> don't<00:04:14.620> forget<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.479> how<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.979> adjust<00:04:17.979> it

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
long don't forget the how to adjust it

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.490 
long don't forget the how to adjust it
and<00:04:18.370> keep<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.239> mind<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.810> can<00:04:19.989> put<00:04:20.199> a

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
and keep in mind that you can put a

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.990 
and keep in mind that you can put a
little<00:04:22.080> keep<00:04:23.080> stack<00:04:23.440> on<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.430> now<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.699> can<00:04:24.970> see

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
little keep stack on so now you can see

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.670 
little keep stack on so now you can see
that<00:04:25.449> it's<00:04:25.690> affecting<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.290> ball<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.470> little

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
that it's affecting the ball a little

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.210 
that it's affecting the ball a little
bit<00:04:26.830> more<00:04:27.130> but<00:04:28.030> this<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.419> ugly<00:04:29.370> very<00:04:30.370> ugly<00:04:32.220> if

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
bit more but this is ugly very ugly if

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.379 
bit more but this is ugly very ugly if
you<00:04:33.970> look<00:04:34.180> at<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.389> light<00:04:34.540> itself<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:36.729> have<00:04:37.030> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
you look at the light itself you have a

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.840 
you look at the light itself you have a
lot<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:37.960> other<00:04:38.320> things<00:04:38.979> to<00:04:39.190> play<00:04:39.370> around<00:04:39.490> with

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
lot of other things to play around with

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.529 
lot of other things to play around with
like<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.389> intensity<00:04:41.080> okay<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:43.240> can<00:04:43.419> adjust

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
like the intensity okay you can adjust

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:52.200 
like the intensity okay you can adjust
this<00:04:43.960> intensity<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.030> now<00:04:46.030> look<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:51.210> that's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
this intensity and now look at it that's

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.320 
this intensity and now look at it that's
nice<00:04:53.400> okay<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.760> can<00:04:54.880> almost<00:04:55.030> have<00:04:55.300> to

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
nice okay you can almost have to

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.270 
nice okay you can almost have to
separate<00:04:55.930> lights<00:04:56.199> going<00:04:56.590> at<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.919> same<00:04:57.070> time

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
separate lights going at the same time

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.100 
separate lights going at the same time
one<00:04:57.639> just<00:04:57.880> for<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> noise<00:04:58.300> ratio<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.080> the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
one just for the noise ratio and the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.270 
one just for the noise ratio and the
other<00:04:59.800> one<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.580> handle<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.000> special<00:05:01.449> effects

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
other one to handle the special effects

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.370 
other one to handle the special effects
so<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.460> probably<00:05:04.389> would<00:05:04.570> be<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.260> know

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
so this probably would be you know

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.930 
so this probably would be you know
something<00:05:05.770> up<00:05:05.889> at<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.130> ceiling<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.760> has

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
something up at the ceiling that has

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.310 
something up at the ceiling that has
little<00:05:07.150> holes<00:05:07.449> in<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:08.020> light<00:05:08.289> is

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
little holes in it that light is

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.080 
little holes in it that light is
trickling<00:05:08.919> down<00:05:09.370> through<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:11.700> would<00:05:12.700> probably

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
trickling down through I would probably

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.360 
trickling down through I would probably
choose<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:14.080> light<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.500> ball<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.950> little<00:05:15.160> bit

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
choose to light the ball a little bit

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.750 
choose to light the ball a little bit
differently<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:17.099> has<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.130> lot<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.610> do

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
differently and that has a lot to do

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.710 
differently and that has a lot to do
with<00:05:18.789> this<00:05:19.680> because<00:05:20.680> right<00:05:21.070> now<00:05:21.099> these<00:05:21.880> strong

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
with this because right now these strong

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.120 
with this because right now these strong
rays<00:05:23.320> do<00:05:23.830> not<00:05:23.979> represent<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:26.130> illumination

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
rays do not represent the illumination

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.860 
rays do not represent the illumination
that's<00:05:27.370> appearing<00:05:27.669> on<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.360> ball<00:05:28.510> itself

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
that's appearing on to the ball itself

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.890 
that's appearing on to the ball itself
so<00:05:29.740> i<00:05:29.800> would<00:05:29.979> say<00:05:30.130> maybe<00:05:30.340> point<00:05:30.789> five<00:05:31.120> would<00:05:31.870> be

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
so i would say maybe point five would be

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.779 
so i would say maybe point five would be
a<00:05:32.050> better<00:05:32.320> illumination<00:05:32.950> for<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.550> type<00:05:33.760> of

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
a better illumination for this type of

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:43.440 
a better illumination for this type of
effect<00:05:39.180> okay<00:05:40.349> and<00:05:41.669> that<00:05:42.669> means<00:05:43.030> you<00:05:43.240> would

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
effect okay and that means you would

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.890 
effect okay and that means you would
have<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:43.660> take<00:05:44.020> your<00:05:44.410> noise<00:05:44.800> ratio<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.720> up<00:05:46.720> it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
have to take your noise ratio and up it

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.159 
have to take your noise ratio and up it
to<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.139> more<00:05:47.440> black<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:47.950> white<00:05:48.099> value<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.990> there

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
to a more black and white value so there

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.839 
to a more black and white value so there
is<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:51.669> there's<00:05:52.030> so<00:05:52.330> much<00:05:52.680> here<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:53.889> you

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
is that there's so much here that you

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.560 
is that there's so much here that you
need<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.360> kind<00:05:55.660> of<00:05:55.900> work<00:05:56.680> with<00:05:56.849> play<00:05:57.849> with<00:05:58.180> and

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
need to kind of work with play with and

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.230 
need to kind of work with play with and
learn<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:59.860> there's<00:06:00.460> no<00:06:00.760> way<00:06:00.910> you<00:06:00.970> could

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
learn that there's no way you could

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.960 
learn that there's no way you could
cover<00:06:01.450> every<00:06:01.960> nuance<00:06:02.199> on<00:06:02.740> on<00:06:03.370> some<00:06:03.729> kind<00:06:03.849> of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
cover every nuance on on some kind of

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.000 
cover every nuance on on some kind of
video<00:06:06.240> alright<00:06:07.240> now<00:06:07.840> that<00:06:07.900> we<00:06:08.169> understand<00:06:08.800> how

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
video alright now that we understand how

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.640 
video alright now that we understand how
to<00:06:09.070> maybe<00:06:09.760> add<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.150> special<00:06:10.479> fact<00:06:10.990> let's<00:06:11.440> kind

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
to maybe add a special fact let's kind

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.080 
to maybe add a special fact let's kind
of<00:06:11.680> look<00:06:11.740> at<00:06:11.979> different<00:06:12.370> concepts<00:06:12.820> in<00:06:13.000> the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
of look at different concepts in the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.630 
of look at different concepts in the
next<00:06:13.360> video
