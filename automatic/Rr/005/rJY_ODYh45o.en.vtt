00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.719
 international police think that 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.120
 Passengers traveling with passports 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.069
 stolen have no relation to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 terrorist groups but it has not been 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.940
 discarded that others on the flight 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.829
 could have it all 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.809
 investigations of this type have arrived 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.790
 to a conclusion although it does not always leave 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 satisfied everyone and sometimes 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.140
 delay more than expected in history 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.090
 of global aviation the causes of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
 incidents like this have been related 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 with a range of possibilities and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.270
 less conventional ones go from the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.800
 suicide of the pilot until a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.800
 knockdown by mistake 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.480
 these are the two men of 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.520
 Iranian nationality one of 18 and the other 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 of 29 years traveling with passports 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.070
 stolen on flight 370 they knew each other and 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 according to the Malaysian authorities the most 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.290
 young man expected to meet his mother in 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.730
 germany and seek asylum there interpol is 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.040
 inclined to think that it was not a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.750
 terrorist incident and the CIA says that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.930
 at least very related to the two 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.970
 Iranians but there may be more clearly 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.949
 it is still a mystery what is very 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.289
 worrying and until we find 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.479
 the pieces of the plane we can not do 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.060
 the forensic tests that take us to a 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.420
 good way but do not rule out that there 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.670
 been terrorism not at all the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.320
 Malaysian authorities in turn narrows in 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.780
 his own research and he has 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 confirmed that the plane was out of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.920
 your route 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.979
 to the last hoyer 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.939
 we are looking in four areas one of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.070
 kidnapping two sabotages three problems 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.680
 psychological problems of passengers or 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.810
 crew and four a possible problem 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.560
 between those who traveled and those who were 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.560
 in charge of the flight 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.409
 in history the disappearances of a 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.450
 aircraft in flight are scarce but have 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.610
 happened although most of the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.340
 Air accidents happen at takeoff 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.289
 or on landing a ship can have 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.720
 a sudden problem and getting lost 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.490
 radar but not forever much more 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.899
 they have to be somewhere we have 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.060
 that find it 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.700
 the air france in which they died 228 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 people in 2009 and I was traveling from river to 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.080
 janeiro to paris was found almost two 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.150
 years later the researchers 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.730
 concluded that it was about problems 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.600
 technicians mixed with the inability to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.519
 the pilots to handle the situation in 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.310
 1999 a plane of egypt air that went from 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.930
 new york- to cairo with 217 people 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.310
 on board crashed into the ocean 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.170
 Atlantic 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.750
 usa said the co-pilot 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.930
 intentionally dropped the ship 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.299
 Egypt determined mechanical failures and the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.290
 The most controversial conclusion is that of flight 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.110
 800 of transworld airlines in 1996 where 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.200
 230 people who were traveling from 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.299
 new york- a roma four years took 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.580
 in affirming that the most probable cause was 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.300
 an explosion 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.670
 possibly generated by a 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.159
 short but not all were left 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.409
 conforming there was speculation about a 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.940
 terrorist attack and even a missile 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.360
 fired by a warship 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.519
 American in all these cases the 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.519
 ships had been around for an hour 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.610
 flight and failed to emit a signal 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.410
 of help in the last hours the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.959
 Families of at least 19 people 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.030
 disappeared on flight 370 they say that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.250
 their cell phones still have 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.870
 call tone the experts say that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.879
 the batteries of the old cell phones 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 they last more than 24 hours but that 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.450
 this is probably happening 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.340
 because the service providers 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.230
 program the phone to ring a couple 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.629
 of times before sending a message of 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.700
 voice however in a cited article 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.280
 by the British tabloid 'daily mail' 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.530
 others say that if they really 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.959
 calls are entering the phones 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.290
 they might not be under the sea but until 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.799
 now they are all theories for gonzÃ¡lez
