00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
mmm part 2 for the update I guess

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.120 
mmm part 2 for the update I guess
so<00:00:05.460> as<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.910> can<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.470> kind<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> an<00:00:07.680> almost

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
so as you can see a kind of an almost

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.740 
so as you can see a kind of an almost
sort<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> finish<00:00:09.300> line<00:00:09.860> pistol<00:00:10.860> okay<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.940> don't

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
sort of finish line pistol okay I don't

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.959 
sort of finish line pistol okay I don't
think<00:00:12.900> I'll<00:00:13.019> paint<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.349> because<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.790> don't

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
think I'll paint it because I just don't

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.800 
think I'll paint it because I just don't
feel<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.389> anyways<00:00:15.750> um<00:00:17.029> it's<00:00:18.029> still<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
feel like it anyways um it's still in

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
feel like it anyways um it's still in
testing<00:00:19.260> phase<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.220> firing<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:22.279> have<00:00:23.279> gotten

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
testing phase of firing I have gotten

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.470 
testing phase of firing I have gotten
the<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:25.099> cycle<00:00:26.099> probably<00:00:26.640> properly<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the two cycle probably properly with a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.650 
the two cycle probably properly with a
blank<00:00:28.260> round<00:00:29.090> like<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:31.189> using<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> gas

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
blank round like this one using the gas

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.810 
blank round like this one using the gas
control<00:00:36.660> nozzle<00:00:37.399> that<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.050> basically<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
control nozzle that is just basically a

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
control nozzle that is just basically a
cap<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> shampoo<00:00:43.110> bottle<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
cap of a shampoo bottle that I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100 
cap of a shampoo bottle that I
discovered<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.480> drill<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> hole<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.899> put<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
discovered it drill a hole in put a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.459 
discovered it drill a hole in put a
paper<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.250> melt<00:00:47.460> away<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.989> need<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
paper so don't melt away I just need to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.410 
paper so don't melt away I just need to
screw<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.399> tip<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> gun<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
screw on the very tip of the gun and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
screw on the very tip of the gun and
that<00:00:51.629> basically<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> amount<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that basically then it's the amount of

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.920 
that basically then it's the amount of
gas<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:54.090> flow<00:00:54.390> through<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> front

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gas that would flow through the front

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439 
gas that would flow through the front
end<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.980> state<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.370> cycle<00:00:56.579> into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> gas

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
end and state it will cycle into the gas

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
end and state it will cycle into the gas
tube<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:59.239> simple<00:01:00.239> concept<00:01:01.070> anyways

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
tube so yeah very simple concept anyways

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
tube so yeah very simple concept anyways
so<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:05.060> basic<00:01:06.060> 30<00:01:06.420> round<00:01:06.659> magazine

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
so we have this basic 30 round magazine

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
so we have this basic 30 round magazine
which<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:08.750> doesn't<00:01:09.750> having<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> spring

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
which actually doesn't having a spring

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.490 
which actually doesn't having a spring
in<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.210> purely<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.510> display<00:01:12.840> purpose<00:01:13.290> for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
in it so purely for display purpose for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.910 
in it so purely for display purpose for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
now until I make the spring and what I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
now until I make the spring and what I
use<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.580> 10<00:01:18.000> round<00:01:18.240> magazine<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:19.500> one

sight oh how do you make the reel
I<00:01:46.229> didn't<00:01:46.530> make<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> real<00:01:46.890> sight<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:48.060> notice

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I didn't make it real sight just notice

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
I didn't make it real sight just notice

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
reliable safety off and pull the trigger

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.319 
reliable safety off and pull the trigger
this<00:01:59.040> is<00:02:01.100> bow<00:02:02.100> itself<00:02:02.579> obviously<00:02:02.729> based<00:02:03.210> on

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this is bow itself obviously based on

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.450 
this is bow itself obviously based on
vaycay<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.469> actually<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:05.100> parts<00:02:05.340> are

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
vaycay but it's actually some parts are

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.350 
vaycay but it's actually some parts are
a<00:02:05.490> lot<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.320> like<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.799> example<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a lot different like for example the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
a lot different like for example the
ejection<00:02:09.840> four<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
ejection four is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.670 
ejection four is
some<00:02:11.460> reason<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.030> inverted<00:02:12.660> supposed<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
some reason it's inverted supposed to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.699 
some reason it's inverted supposed to
being<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> top<00:02:14.840> instead<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.930> confident<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
being on the top instead of confident to

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.260 
being on the top instead of confident to
the<00:02:16.800> receiver<00:02:17.310> ride<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.850> white<00:02:18.030> has

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the receiver ride on the white has

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.699 
the receiver ride on the white has
happened<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.870> did<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.240> mmm<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:22.050> still

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
happened but just did so mmm it's still

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.230 
happened but just did so mmm it's still
fine

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
fine

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.910 
fine
so<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.770> basically<00:02:26.570> just<00:02:27.570> comes<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.500> show<00:02:28.709> how

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
so it basically just comes to show how

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.420 
so it basically just comes to show how
simple<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.730> function<00:02:30.150> or<00:02:30.390> mechanism<00:02:31.170> is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
simple like a function or mechanism is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.100 
simple like a function or mechanism is
fact<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.820> make<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.060> out<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.209> paper

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
fact that you can make it out of paper

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.850 
fact that you can make it out of paper
and<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.420> real<00:02:36.630> thing<00:02:39.860> it's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and there's just like real thing it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
and there's just like real thing it's
got<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> rotating<00:02:41.220> bolt<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.270> locks

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
got a rotating bolt that locks

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
got a rotating bolt that locks
I'm<00:02:44.070> sure<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.520> see<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:46.580> will<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
I'm sure if you can see it but will that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.750 
I'm sure if you can see it but will that
rotate<00:02:48.739> when<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> close<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.130> rotates<00:02:50.550> back

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
rotate when I close this rotates back

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
rotate when I close this rotates back
now<00:02:51.830> I'm<00:02:52.830> sure<00:02:53.130> if<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> saw<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:54.230> all<00:02:55.230> right

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
now I'm sure if you saw that all right

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.290 
now I'm sure if you saw that all right
yeah<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:55.980> pull<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.850> trigger

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
yeah so pull the trigger

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.160 
yeah so pull the trigger
fire<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> keep<00:02:58.739> keep<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> troop<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
fire so you keep keep the troop like it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.220 
fire so you keep keep the troop like it
has<00:03:01.320> us<00:03:02.000> disconnect<00:03:03.000> er<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.330> when<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.720> have

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
has us disconnect er so when you have

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.850 
has us disconnect er so when you have
the<00:03:04.410> sugar<00:03:04.860> polled<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.120> cycles<00:03:06.570> back<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the sugar polled and the cycles back the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740 
the sugar polled and the cycles back the
hammer<00:03:08.400> stays<00:03:08.820> down<00:03:09.180> because<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
hammer stays down because the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.009 
hammer stays down because the
disconnectors<00:03:11.120> holding<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.269> hammer<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
disconnectors holding the hammer and

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.990 
disconnectors holding the hammer and
when<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.200> release<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.440> trigger<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:14.820> hooks

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
when you release the trigger it hooks

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
when you release the trigger it hooks
back<00:03:15.209> onto<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.750> original<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:18.570> sear<00:03:19.340> so

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
back onto the original the the sear so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.569 
back onto the original the the sear so
you<00:03:20.400> pull<00:03:20.670> trigger<00:03:21.150> again<00:03:21.390> just<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.579> so

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
you pull trigger again just like that so

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.690 
you pull trigger again just like that so
I'm<00:03:23.880> not<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.390> hello<00:03:25.110> I'm<00:03:25.829> still<00:03:26.130> thinking

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I'm not really hello I'm still thinking

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.569 
I'm not really hello I'm still thinking
whether<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.120> should<00:03:27.209> disassemble<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.079> or<00:03:28.200> not

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
whether I should disassemble it or not

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.850 
whether I should disassemble it or not
because<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.610> know<00:03:29.910> there<00:03:30.060> bazillion<00:03:30.860> videos

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
because you know there bazillion videos

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.949 
because you know there bazillion videos
I'll<00:03:32.579> show<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.790> how<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.060> disassemble<00:03:33.360> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
I'll show you how to disassemble and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.690 
I'll show you how to disassemble and
stuff<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.440> think<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.250> one<00:03:35.310> I'll<00:03:35.549> just

took out all those chambers so very very
simple<00:03:52.860> mechanism<00:03:53.430> silencer<00:03:55.370> thang<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.630> you

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
simple mechanism silencer thang and you

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.330 
simple mechanism silencer thang and you
just<00:03:57.870> screw<00:03:58.079> this<00:03:58.170> on<00:03:58.350> just<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.890> real

thing and the cool thing about this is

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.699 
thing and the cool thing about this is
that<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:04.019> actually<00:04:04.140> use<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.500> as<00:04:04.680> a

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
that you can actually use this as a

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.810 
that you can actually use this as a
grenade<00:04:05.040> launcher<00:04:05.070> Cup<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.609> I'm<00:04:08.609> going<00:04:08.760> to

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
that's something I didn't really think

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.110 
that's something I didn't really think
of<00:04:15.480> when<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> was<00:04:16.050> made<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.670> so<00:04:17.670> another<00:04:17.910> cool

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
part and the bullets are again just call

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.800 
part and the bullets are again just call
it<00:04:22.200> pencil<00:04:22.470> tips<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.920> park<00:04:23.700> paper<00:04:23.970> cartridge

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
it pencil tips and park paper cartridge

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.780 
it pencil tips and park paper cartridge
with<00:04:24.990> primer<00:04:25.610> cetera<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> real

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
with primer cetera and this is the real

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.940 
with primer cetera and this is the real
ak-47<00:04:29.790> round<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.120> 7.62<00:04:30.780> by<00:04:31.020> 39<00:04:31.170> millimeter

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
ak-47 round the 7.62 by 39 millimeter

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.950 
ak-47 round the 7.62 by 39 millimeter
and<00:04:32.250> not<00:04:33.180> sure<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.510> can<00:04:33.660> tell<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
and not sure if you can tell the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.390 
and not sure if you can tell the
difference<00:04:34.290> when<00:04:34.440> my<00:04:34.590> cartridge<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.100> slightly

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
difference when my cartridge is slightly

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.300 
difference when my cartridge is slightly
smaller<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.680> again<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.800> wasn't<00:04:38.040> really

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
smaller and again I wasn't really

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.060 
smaller and again I wasn't really
thinking<00:04:38.460> much<00:04:38.670> why<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> made<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.740> just<00:04:40.740> a

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
thinking much why I made this so just a

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.480 
thinking much why I made this so just a
little<00:04:41.790> bit<00:04:41.880> smaller<00:04:42.060> no<00:04:43.020> be<00:04:43.250> still<00:04:44.250> works

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
little bit smaller no be still works

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.020 
little bit smaller no be still works
fine<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:46.040> let's<00:04:47.040> approach<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.430> really<00:04:47.880> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
fine so let's approach it really you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.410 
fine so let's approach it really you
know<00:04:48.060> just<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.340> said<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.610> don't<00:04:50.850> know<00:04:51.060> I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
know just like I said I don't know I

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.160 
know just like I said I don't know I
might<00:04:52.140> make<00:04:52.290> a<00:04:52.320> video<00:04:52.500> on<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.720> clothes<00:04:54.720> detail

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
might make a video on the clothes detail

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.640 
might make a video on the clothes detail
the<00:04:55.410> functions<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.220> such<00:04:56.370> like<00:04:56.760> you<00:04:56.970> know<00:04:57.650> the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
the functions and such like you know the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.440 
the functions and such like you know the
innards<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.610> whatnot<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.800> formatting<00:05:02.450> will
