00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
to be supercharged this just the turbos

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.140 
to be supercharged this just the turbos
roll<00:05:41.710> with<00:05:41.919> hair<00:05:42.160> and<00:05:42.340> more<00:05:42.460> gradually<00:05:42.970> but

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
roll with hair and more gradually but

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.020 
roll with hair and more gradually but
once<00:05:43.900> spooled<00:05:44.500> up<00:05:44.650> but<00:05:45.160> boost<00:05:45.340> comes<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.850> then

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
once spooled up but boost comes and then

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.450 
once spooled up but boost comes and then
she's<00:05:46.240> she's<00:05:46.630> all<00:05:46.780> on<00:05:46.960> she<00:05:47.169> takes<00:05:47.410> off<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:47.740> yeah
