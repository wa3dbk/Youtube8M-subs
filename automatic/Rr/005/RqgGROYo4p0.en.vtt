engagement<00:00:20.369> look<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:21.090> bad<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.420> him<00:00:21.570> when

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
engagement look really bad for him when

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.779 
engagement look really bad for him when
he<00:00:21.750> went<00:00:21.900> into<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.400> big

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
he went into it you know I think the big

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.439 
he went into it you know I think the big
difference<00:00:24.170> was<00:00:25.170> made<00:00:25.439> by<00:00:25.740> mana<00:00:26.670> making<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
difference was made by mana making a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
difference was made by mana making a
really<00:00:27.810> nice<00:00:27.990> move<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.650> turned<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
really nice move which turned out to be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
really nice move which turned out to be
bad<00:00:29.400> he<00:00:29.699> blinked<00:00:29.910> forward<00:00:30.359> yeah<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> did

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
bad he blinked forward yeah and did

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.620 
bad he blinked forward yeah and did
damage<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> Colossus<00:00:32.189> yep<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.759> didn't<00:00:33.390> end<00:00:33.510> up

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
damage to Colossus yep but didn't end up

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510 
damage to Colossus yep but didn't end up
killing<00:00:33.660> him<00:00:34.140> yeah<00:00:34.290> exactly<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.070> instead<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
killing him yeah exactly so instead of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000 
killing him yeah exactly so instead of
taking<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> damaged<00:00:37.020> unit<00:00:37.410> which

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
taking out a lot of damaged unit which

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
taking out a lot of damaged unit which
may<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.370> beacon<00:00:38.850> by<00:00:39.000> Colossus<00:00:39.450> he<00:00:39.899> could

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
may like beacon by Colossus he could

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
may like beacon by Colossus he could
have<00:00:40.110> maybe<00:00:40.350> taken<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.829> 10<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.160> units

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
have maybe taken out 10 more units

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.950 
have maybe taken out 10 more units
because<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> hit<00:00:42.660> points

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
because they all know in hit points

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.810 
because they all know in hit points
instead<00:00:43.440> he<00:00:43.620> damaged<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.129> Colossus<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
instead he damaged one Colossus but it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
instead he damaged one Colossus but it
survived<00:00:45.149> yeah<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.780> could<00:00:45.930> steal<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.739> deal

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
survived yeah so it could steal the deal

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
survived yeah so it could steal the deal
damage<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.390> useless<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
damage so basically was useless one to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
damage so basically was useless one to
play<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.320> word<00:00:49.649> exactly<00:00:49.800> night<00:00:50.399> end<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
play for word exactly night end was

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459 
play for word exactly night end was
incredibly<00:00:51.570> good<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.840> his<00:00:51.930> control<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
incredibly good with his control in that

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
incredibly good with his control in that
engagement<00:00:52.649> he<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.309> dancing<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
engagement he was dancing with the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
engagement he was dancing with the
Colossus<00:00:54.600> he<00:00:54.899> called<00:00:55.110> his<00:00:55.199> engagements<00:00:55.739> just

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
Colossus he called his engagements just

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.229 
Colossus he called his engagements just
write<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> units<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> correct<00:00:57.090> place

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
write the units in the correct place

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
write the units in the correct place
mana<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> other<00:00:58.320> hand<00:00:58.530> didn't<00:00:59.070> work<00:00:59.190> out

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
mana on the other hand didn't work out

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
mana on the other hand didn't work out
so<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.789> got<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.120> impetuous<00:01:00.390> leaping

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
so what he got a bit impetuous leaping

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
so what he got a bit impetuous leaping
outward<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.680> say<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> mean<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
outward as you say I mean look at the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.990 
outward as you say I mean look at the
score<00:01:03.449> screen<00:01:03.690> man<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.379> 2.5<00:01:05.220> came<00:01:05.820> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
score screen man I had 2.5 came on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
score screen man I had 2.5 came on
minerals<00:01:06.590> that's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.740> huge<00:01:08.100> lead<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.430> PvP<00:01:09.030> but

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
minerals that's a huge lead in PvP but

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
minerals that's a huge lead in PvP but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
better thought he's not going to be too

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
better thought he's not going to be too
I<00:01:14.820> thought<00:01:15.210> he's<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.689> too<00:01:15.840> patient<00:01:16.049> but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
I thought he's gonna be too patient but

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.730 
I thought he's gonna be too patient but
in<00:01:16.860> work<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.720> yeah<00:01:18.720> turns<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> was

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
in work out yeah turns out that that was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
in work out yeah turns out that that was
not<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> case<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> night<00:01:20.970> end<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.330> an

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
not the case in night end with an

really mana wanted to take that a with a
strong<00:01:25.500> PvP<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.549> been<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> good

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
remember when actually jinro was doing

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.250 
remember when actually jinro was doing
incredibly<00:02:18.640> well<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:19.209> Marla<00:02:19.840> took<00:02:19.989> him<00:02:20.140> out

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
incredibly well when Marla took him out

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.900 
incredibly well when Marla took him out
actually<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:21.010> watching<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.370> much<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
actually I was watching that much and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.250 
actually I was watching that much and
that<00:02:22.000> was<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.209> impressive<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:23.050> don't<00:02:23.230> think

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that was a very impressive I don't think

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.570 
that was a very impressive I don't think
anyone<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.620> expected<00:02:23.800> from<00:02:24.220> Arnhem<00:02:24.489> at

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
anyone really expected from Arnhem at

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.030 
anyone really expected from Arnhem at
that<00:02:24.700> point<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.060> his<00:02:25.480> tbp<00:02:25.959> really<00:02:26.769> strong

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
that point but his tbp really strong

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.910 
that point but his tbp really strong
yeah<00:02:27.250> cast<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> other<00:02:28.300> hand<00:02:28.530> monstrous<00:02:29.530> he

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
yeah cast on the other hand monstrous he

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.009 
yeah cast on the other hand monstrous he
practices<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.760> much<00:02:31.060> he<00:02:31.300> plays<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.780> many<00:02:31.840> games

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
practices so much he plays so many games

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.809 
practices so much he plays so many games
so<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.250> that's<00:02:33.459> going<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
so I think that's going to be a

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.130 
so I think that's going to be a
fantastic<00:02:34.120> match<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.569> well<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.750> got<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.959> cast

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
fantastic match it well we got to cast

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
fantastic match it well we got to cast
it<00:02:35.290> too<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.769> absolutely<00:02:36.340> better<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.880> mana<00:02:37.450> I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it too so absolutely better and mana I

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.170 
it too so absolutely better and mana I
mean<00:02:38.230> cast<00:02:38.500> completely<00:02:39.099> out<00:02:39.280> macro<00:02:39.819> datura

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
mean cast completely out macro datura

something<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.099> note<00:02:42.549> because<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.870> was<00:02:44.110> pretty

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
something to note because it was pretty

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.050
