00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.130
 presentation of the new model 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.380
 at the south gala will follow a ballistic test of 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.300
 this new model with some 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.510
 salient features slightly 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.070
 different from the usual 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.869
 in this way the object has a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.540
 then grabbed piro mimicry obtained 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.010
 with a worked incandescent tip 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.710
 then handcrafted that point of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.290
 view is a pair of pulleys 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.629
 a circular elastic for 18 both 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.079
 tires are from 18 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.780
 as you can see is the road 8 mm 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:58.250
 the text and ballistic will be made 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.170
 with a 9 meter long metric rope but 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.079
 to give you the guarantee that the test is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.430
 absolutely real and not with ma 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.080
 fantasy 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.300
 I brought exactly one meter per 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.400
 make you notice the exact distance there is 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.400
 between one float is another 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.910
 also the guarantee that the rifle is 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.490
 actually a 95 point out 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.920
 exact distance between 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.360
 the origin of the tires at the beginning of 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.630
 more law so that it goes to crush 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 strong the elastic is the entrance to the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.140
 shutter box 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.030
 here I recall in this regard that the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.100
 nominal distance of any rifle 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.090
 this then exists from the origin of 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.479
 thrust 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.979
 the bond farthest from us up 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.050
 at the entrance of the redemption box the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.370
 all out of the gun is quite another 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 question that has nothing to do 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.850
 with the nominal length of the rifle 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.080
 so now we go into the water and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 let's see what happens
