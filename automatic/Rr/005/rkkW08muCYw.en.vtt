00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I thought every year maybe I'll have

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.859

you<00:01:46.399> know<00:01:46.490> one<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:46.939> starfish<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.630> can

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
help and I can change their life and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.249 
help and I can change their life and
really<00:01:49.820> make<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> difference<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.780> then<00:01:51.170> I

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
really make a difference and then I

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.749 
really make a difference and then I
started<00:01:51.619> teaching<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.159> realized<00:01:52.490> very
