 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.240
 We are going to make some booklets if not 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.010
 understand or none of my videos 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.010
 subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.919
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:30.220
 There are 5 tenderloin steaks 5 slices of ham 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.030
 serrano 5 slices of cheese to melt 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.309
 a little salt an egg breadcrumbs and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 black pepper first thing we're going to 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 to do is salpimentar the loin we are going to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.120
 take a little salt 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.940
 and a little pepper 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.190
 once we have it seasoned 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's fill in as you see I have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.370
 I told the butcher to open the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.180
 tenderloin in two let's put a slice of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.059
 cheese folded in half 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.960
 and the ham was won and now we're going to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.869
 Bend 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 and as you see the book is already done 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.310
 then we are going to tarnish them 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.440
 We will put a pan on a high heat with 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 abundant olive oil until it 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.060
 hot we will beat the egg 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.420
 Now we are going to tarnish the fillets for 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420
 fry 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.300
 we went through the egg first 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.300
 and then on the screen 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 we tap it so that it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 adhere well the bread 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.420
 and we're taking them out to a plate once 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.469
 that is the hot oil we will put 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.979
 medium fire and let's go see the 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.979
 steaks 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.540
 once they have done us on the one hand they 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.300
 we will turn around so they were noticeable 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.520
 on the other side once we have been 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.070
 done with both sides we will take them out 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.020
 a tray with absorbent paper because 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.720
