to do is we need to talk provide
supplementary<00:01:30.040> power<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.470> done

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
supplementary power this can be done

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.950 
supplementary power this can be done
using<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.210> 5<00:01:34.570> volts<00:01:35.190> adapter<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.430> mobile

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
using a 5 volts adapter of a of a mobile

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.250 
using a 5 volts adapter of a of a mobile
now<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.140> adapter<00:01:41.790> has<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.900> USB<00:01:45.030> connection

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
now this adapter has a USB connection

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.930 
now this adapter has a USB connection
now<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.680> for<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.040> mobile<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:48.910> a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
now this is for the mobile it is a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.530 
now this is for the mobile it is a
microUSB<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:51.100> cable<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.790> can<00:01:51.970> just<00:01:52.180> remove

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
microUSB this cable we can just remove

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
microUSB this cable we can just remove
and<00:01:52.870> fetch<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:56.220> USB<00:01:57.720> male<00:01:59.280> 2<00:02:00.280> USB<00:02:00.790> female

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and fetch a USB male 2 USB female

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.680 
and fetch a USB male 2 USB female
so<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.740> u.s.<00:02:03.040> female<00:02:03.400> connector<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.510> can

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so this u.s. female connector you can

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.469 
so this u.s. female connector you can
connect<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.380> adapter<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:07.000> USB

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
connect in this adapter and the USB

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.610 
connect in this adapter and the USB
female<00:02:07.660> adapter<00:02:08.140> we<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.160> connect<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
female adapter we can connect with the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.220 
female adapter we can connect with the
supplementary<00:02:12.239> USB<00:02:13.239> connection<00:02:13.720> applied

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
supplementary USB connection applied

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.880 
supplementary USB connection applied
with<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.500> external<00:02:15.430> hard<00:02:15.730> drive<00:02:16.530> once<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.739> do

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
with the external hard drive once we do

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.540 
with the external hard drive once we do
this<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.900> notice<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.470> light<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
this you notice the light on this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.180 
this you notice the light on this
adapter<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:22.989> when<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.410> put<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.860> into<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
adapter now when we put this into the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:38.600 
adapter now when we put this into the
mains<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:28.290> switch<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:31.239> will<00:02:31.390> notice

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.970 

USB<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.600> mounted<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.770> done

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
USB is mounted so what we have done

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.000 
USB is mounted so what we have done
basically<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.840> we've<00:02:45.840> used<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.320> power<00:02:49.010> from

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
basically is we've used the power from

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.290 
basically is we've used the power from
the<00:02:51.350> five<00:02:52.350> volt<00:02:52.620> adapter<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:54.390> power<00:02:54.660> our<00:02:54.930> USB

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
the five volt adapter to power our USB

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.830 
the five volt adapter to power our USB
okay<00:02:57.470> what<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.780> show<00:03:00.780> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
okay what we can do is just show you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.340 
okay what we can do is just show you
sign<00:03:01.740> manager<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:09.060> setup<00:03:09.450> doesn't<00:03:09.960> need<00:03:10.110> to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
sign manager the setup doesn't need to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.700 
sign manager the setup doesn't need to
be<00:03:10.470> moved<00:03:10.710> if<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.790> moved<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.710> things

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
be moved if it is moved then things

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:25.930 
be moved if it is moved then things
start<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.100> become<00:03:14.990> problematic<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
start to become problematic this is the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.550 
start to become problematic this is the
USB<00:03:28.459> external<00:03:29.459> drive<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.240> connected<00:03:30.870> as

will need is this charger this 5 volt

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.820 
will need is this charger this 5 volt
output<00:06:35.210> 5<00:06:36.210> volt<00:06:36.449> is<00:06:36.599> important<00:06:37.139> because<00:06:37.529> 5

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
output 5 volt is important because 5

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.290

supplied to a external hard drive and

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.409 
supplied to a external hard drive and
you<00:06:43.349> will<00:06:43.500> need<00:06:43.680> a<00:06:43.710> cable<00:06:44.069> like<00:06:44.400> this<00:06:44.669> which

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
you will need a cable like this which

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.519 
you will need a cable like this which
has<00:06:45.659> a<00:06:45.689> USB<00:06:46.110> male<00:06:46.589> and<00:06:46.830> a<00:06:46.919> USB<00:06:47.219> female<00:06:47.759> and<00:06:48.529> then

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
has a USB male and a USB female and then

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:54.820 
has a USB male and a USB female and then
fit<00:06:49.830> one<00:06:50.039> and<00:06:51.710> so<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:52.800> use<00:06:53.069> the<00:06:53.279> USB<00:06:53.610> male<00:06:54.089> and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
fit one and so you use the USB male and

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.070 
fit one and so you use the USB male and
connect<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:56.009> to<00:06:56.039> this<00:06:56.779> charger<00:06:58.219> there<00:06:59.219> as<00:06:59.370> you
