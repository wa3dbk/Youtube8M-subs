00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
might be too responsive and too quick

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.379 
might be too responsive and too quick
which<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.379> tuned<00:06:02.189> out<00:06:02.339> there<00:06:02.729> I<00:06:02.759> think<00:06:03.029> you<00:06:03.300> guys

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
which I tuned out there I think you guys

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.999 
which I tuned out there I think you guys
saw<00:06:03.659> like<00:06:03.959> the<00:06:03.989> right<00:06:04.469> before<00:06:04.709> the<00:06:04.800> video

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
saw like the right before the video

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.859 
saw like the right before the video
started<00:06:05.809> this<00:06:06.809> thing<00:06:07.019> is<00:06:07.319> just<00:06:08.449> it's<00:06:09.449> got<00:06:09.599> so

00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:09.869 
started this thing is just it's got so

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.469 
started this thing is just it's got so
much<00:06:10.019> grip<00:06:10.439> it's<00:06:10.709> got<00:06:10.919> big<00:06:11.489> 285<00:06:12.029> s<00:06:12.179> in<00:06:12.239> the<00:06:12.330> back

only running about 550 horsepower which
is<00:06:18.300> really<00:06:18.599> enough<00:06:19.969> you<00:06:20.969> know<00:06:21.089> especially

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:21.269 
is really enough you know especially

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.790 
is really enough you know especially
when<00:06:21.599> i'm<00:06:21.689> coming<00:06:21.929> around<00:06:22.139> to<00:06:22.349> chain<00:06:22.589> this

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
when i'm coming around to chain this

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.379 
when i'm coming around to chain this
together<00:06:23.039> I<00:06:23.429> was<00:06:23.579> not<00:06:23.759> expecting<00:06:24.379> this<00:06:25.379> car<00:06:26.389> to

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
together I was not expecting this car to

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.199 
together I was not expecting this car to
be<00:06:27.539> able<00:06:27.659> to<00:06:28.399> you<00:06:29.399> know<00:06:29.519> make<00:06:29.729> that<00:06:29.939> transition

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:30.209 
be able to you know make that transition

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:32.239 
be able to you know make that transition
smoothly<00:06:30.779> in<00:06:31.019> fourth<00:06:31.259> gear<00:06:31.469> but<00:06:31.679> yet<00:06:31.860> no

smoothly in fourth gear but yet no
problem<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.699> the<00:06:33.329> 2j<00:06:33.689> engine<00:06:34.050> is<00:06:34.579> fantastic<00:06:35.579> a

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
problem and the 2j engine is fantastic a

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.749 
problem and the 2j engine is fantastic a
lot<00:06:36.899> of<00:06:36.929> us<00:06:37.709> i'm<00:06:37.919> assuming<00:06:38.159> I've<00:06:38.429> never<00:06:38.579> driven

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
lot of us i'm assuming I've never driven

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.100 
lot of us i'm assuming I've never driven

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
with the to J in real life of course but

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.909 
with the to J in real life of course but
I<00:06:40.909> was<00:06:41.909> not<00:06:42.149> expecting<00:06:43.019> there<00:06:43.349> to<00:06:43.379> be<00:06:43.589> so<00:06:43.800> much

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
I was not expecting there to be so much

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.489 
I was not expecting there to be so much
bottom<00:06:44.219> end<00:06:44.339> torque<00:06:44.610> in<00:06:44.849> this<00:06:45.209> engine<00:06:45.599> and<00:06:45.779> it

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
bottom end torque in this engine and it

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:49.579 
bottom end torque in this engine and it
just<00:06:46.860> goes<00:06:47.129> it<00:06:47.550> I'm<00:06:48.539> the<00:06:48.989> engine<00:06:49.349> has<00:06:49.469> no

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:49.589 
just goes it I'm the engine has no

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:51.409 
just goes it I'm the engine has no
problems<00:06:49.919> there's<00:06:50.279> nothing<00:06:50.489> it<00:06:50.819> sounds<00:06:51.209> great

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
problems there's nothing it sounds great

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.989 
problems there's nothing it sounds great
it<00:06:52.019> feels<00:06:52.469> fantastic<00:06:52.649> there's<00:06:53.249> no<00:06:53.369> turbo<00:06:53.759> lag

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:53.999 
it feels fantastic there's no turbo lag

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.480 
it feels fantastic there's no turbo lag
I<00:06:54.389> often<00:06:55.079> stay<00:06:55.439> with<00:06:55.589> stock<00:06:55.800> turbo<00:06:56.159> so<00:06:56.219> maybe

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
I often stay with stock turbo so maybe

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.969 
I often stay with stock turbo so maybe
that<00:06:56.669> has<00:06:56.789> something<00:06:56.819> to<00:06:57.059> do<00:06:57.179> with<00:06:57.269> it<00:06:57.829> lots<00:06:58.829> of

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
that has something to do with it lots of

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.989 
that has something to do with it lots of
torque<00:06:59.309> lots<00:07:00.300> of<00:07:00.479> power<00:07:00.629> when<00:07:00.959> you<00:07:01.050> need<00:07:01.079> it

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:01.999 
torque lots of power when you need it

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.369 
torque lots of power when you need it
again<00:07:02.999> my<00:07:03.179> only<00:07:03.329> complaint<00:07:03.779> for<00:07:03.899> the<00:07:03.959> chassis

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:04.379 
again my only complaint for the chassis

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.689 
again my only complaint for the chassis
maybe<00:07:04.709> is<00:07:04.889> that's<00:07:05.099> a<00:07:05.189> little<00:07:05.429> bit<00:07:05.550> too

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
maybe is that's a little bit too

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:07.249 
maybe is that's a little bit too
touching<00:07:06.059> a<00:07:06.149> little<00:07:06.389> bit<00:07:06.479> too<00:07:06.599> responsive<00:07:07.110> but

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
touching a little bit too responsive but

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.169 
touching a little bit too responsive but
again<00:07:07.499> you<00:07:08.129> know<00:07:08.219> once<00:07:08.459> you<00:07:08.550> get<00:07:08.759> used<00:07:08.999> to<00:07:09.119> it

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:09.179 
again you know once you get used to it

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.850 
again you know once you get used to it
and<00:07:09.779> and<00:07:10.289> you<00:07:10.409> harness<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.069> it<00:07:11.459> is<00:07:11.819> just<00:07:12.179> I

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
and and you harness that it is just I

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.049 
and and you harness that it is just I
can<00:07:13.860> really<00:07:14.099> cannot<00:07:14.399> think<00:07:14.579> of<00:07:14.669> anything<00:07:14.879> I

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059 
can really cannot think of anything I

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.639 
can really cannot think of anything I
dislike<00:07:15.360> about<00:07:15.479> this<00:07:15.719> car<00:07:15.899> maybe<00:07:16.319> the<00:07:16.469> way<00:07:16.529> it

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:16.649 
dislike about this car maybe the way it

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.290 
dislike about this car maybe the way it
look<00:07:16.860> no<00:07:17.039> I<00:07:17.069> still<00:07:17.459> like<00:07:17.639> the<00:07:17.669> way<00:07:17.819> it<00:07:17.909> looks<00:07:17.969> it

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300
