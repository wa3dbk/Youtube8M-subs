00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.610
 hello how am I here with you for 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 talk about the harmonica and everything 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.720
 we can see at the top of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.300
 harmonica that we have these numbers from 1 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.449
 to 10 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.900
 this represent the 10 cells that it has 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.050
 this harmonica on 2 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.980
 the characteristic of the harmonica is that 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.130
 gives us two notes one blown and another 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.880
 suck so in hole 1 we have 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.620
 2 blow 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.680
 we have king in 2000 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.170
 Sun 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.890
 we have sun this same sun but blown 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 from 3 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 then if 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.360
 and from 4 we have the scale 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.410
 natural of 2 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.410
 in this way 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.050
 so we arrived until this moment 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.750
 until 7 is where we have blown 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.550
 the note 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.550
 in 8 we have the king sucked we have 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:45.580
 my blown on the 9 we have sucked 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.820
 they are blown in 10 which is the last 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.890
 cell we have a the sucked for 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.890
 finish with the 2 blowing 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.250
 in this case we went from a serious sound to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.240
 a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.500
 this is the structure of the harmonica of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 atomic among all others 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.210
 tonalities that exist in harmonica 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.110
 It also has this structure with its 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.620
 own alterations we see ourselves for the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620
 following
