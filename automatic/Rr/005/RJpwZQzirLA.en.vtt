00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
day to come on this level and that's it

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.270 
day to come on this level and that's it
actually<00:03:34.269> if<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.170> them<00:03:35.320> both<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.800> one<00:03:36.070> go

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
actually if you get them both in one go

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.670 
actually if you get them both in one go
which<00:03:36.580> does<00:03:36.820> require<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.269> die<00:03:37.450> there<00:03:38.260> is

which does require you to die there is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.850 
which does require you to die there is

no real reason to come back here ever if

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.250 
no real reason to come back here ever if
you<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:42.550> full<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.870> snipers<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:43.900> flying

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you do it's full of snipers and flying

units is generally hell on earth and not
much<00:03:46.480> fun<00:03:46.660> at<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.910> barrier<00:03:49.360> is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
much fun at all this barrier is

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.880 
much fun at all this barrier is
basically<00:03:49.870> geared<00:03:50.290> up<00:03:50.410> just<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.739> have<00:03:50.860> that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
basically geared up just to have that

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.250 
basically geared up just to have that
huge<00:03:51.160> gray<00:03:51.400> carrier<00:03:51.760> in<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.840> pretty

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
huge gray carrier in it so it's pretty

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.900 
huge gray carrier in it so it's pretty
barren<00:03:53.800> it's<00:03:54.310> pretty<00:03:54.580> barren<00:03:54.970> stuff

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
barren it's pretty barren stuff

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.610 
barren it's pretty barren stuff
but<00:03:56.060> they<00:03:56.210> do<00:03:56.270> their<00:03:56.510> best<00:03:56.660> for<00:03:56.840> these<00:03:57.050> days

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
but they do their best for these days

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.230 
but they do their best for these days

bugger works just in case we forgot to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.700 
bugger works just in case we forgot to
read<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:23.000> we're<00:04:23.840> going<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.050> attach<00:04:24.260> him<00:04:24.680> to

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
read it so we're going to attach him to

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.500 
read it so we're going to attach him to
our<00:04:24.950> one<00:04:25.250> button<00:04:25.460> now<00:04:25.550> we<00:04:25.610> would<00:04:25.910> get<00:04:26.120> the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
our one button now we would get the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.940 
our one button now we would get the
yellow<00:04:26.840> mini<00:04:27.050> compost<00:04:27.380> which<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.770> best

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
yellow mini compost which is the best

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.620 
yellow mini compost which is the best
mini<00:04:28.160> compost<00:04:28.580> here<00:04:28.820> except<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> we<00:04:29.600> don't

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
mini compost here except that we don't

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.420 
mini compost here except that we don't
actually<00:04:29.900> have<00:04:30.140> any<00:04:30.320> energy<00:04:30.440> for<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.860> so

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
actually have any energy for it so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.830 
actually have any energy for it so
you're<00:04:31.880> going<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> see<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.450> yellow<00:04:32.570> mini

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
you're going to see a yellow mini

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.540 
you're going to see a yellow mini
compost<00:04:33.170> later<00:04:33.380> on<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.680> leave<00:04:33.830> because<00:04:34.340> we

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
compost later on and leave because we

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.160 
compost later on and leave because we
got<00:04:34.640> deflector<00:04:35.060> an<00:04:35.150> old<00:04:35.330> shit<00:04:35.660> right<00:04:35.930> that's

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
got deflector an old shit right that's

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.420 
got deflector an old shit right that's
their<00:04:36.320> main<00:04:36.440> physics<00:04:36.770> grenadin<00:04:37.130> here's<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.340> bit

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
their main physics grenadin here's a bit

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.320 
their main physics grenadin here's a bit
of<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.580> problem<00:04:37.610> with<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.000> ragdoll<00:04:38.300> physics

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
of a problem with the ragdoll physics

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.770 
of a problem with the ragdoll physics
which<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.290> that<00:04:39.760> if<00:04:40.760> you're<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:41.240> an<00:04:41.390> incline

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
which is that if you're on an incline

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.510 
which is that if you're on an incline
you<00:04:42.200> will<00:04:42.350> slide<00:04:42.590> down<00:04:42.620> until<00:04:43.070> he<00:04:43.190> can<00:04:43.310> stand

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
you will slide down until he can stand

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.740 
you will slide down until he can stand
up<00:04:43.640> which<00:04:43.790> can<00:04:43.970> take<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.210> little<00:04:44.330> one<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.690> the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
up which can take a little one of the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.110 
up which can take a little one of the
times<00:04:45.020> it's<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.650> bit<00:04:45.920> silly<00:04:46.160> like<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.940> just

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
times it's a bit silly like I just

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.570 
times it's a bit silly like I just
jumped<00:04:47.600> for<00:04:47.780> no<00:04:47.870> apparent<00:04:48.200> reason<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:49.310> we're

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
jumped for no apparent reason so we're

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.340 
jumped for no apparent reason so we're
going<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> deal<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.090> these<00:04:50.330> two<00:04:50.600> jackal<00:04:51.140> dies

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
going to deal with these two jackal dies

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.140 
going to deal with these two jackal dies
and<00:04:51.770> we're<00:04:51.890> going<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.040> blown<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.790> bits<00:04:52.910> with

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
and we're going to blown to bits with
