everything he's done as a filmmaker I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.590 
everything he's done as a filmmaker I
think<00:02:52.800> he's<00:02:53.490> put<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:54.120> into<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
think he's put so much into the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.930 
think he's put so much into the
development<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.410> these<00:02:55.709> characters<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
development of a these characters and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.940
