these<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.870> string<00:02:33.650> silencers<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.260> sometimes

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
these are string silencers and sometimes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.080 
these are string silencers and sometimes
a<00:02:37.060> ball<00:02:38.060> will<00:02:38.240> make<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> lot<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.780> noise<00:02:39.050> when<00:02:39.770> you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
a ball will make a lot of noise when you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.660 
a ball will make a lot of noise when you
release<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.740> with<00:02:42.740> an<00:02:42.860> arrow<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
release it with an arrow in it and the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.730 
release it with an arrow in it and the
silencer<00:02:44.240> will<00:02:44.510> dampen<00:02:45.320> some<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
silencer will dampen some of the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.330 
silencer will dampen some of the
vibration<00:02:46.370> which<00:02:46.640> will<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.030> turn<00:02:48.100> quiet<00:02:49.100> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
vibration which will in turn quiet the

vibration which will in turn quiet the
bowl<00:02:49.520> it'll<00:02:50.090> quiet<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.630> release<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:55.810> long

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
bowl it'll quiet the release and a long

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.970 
bowl it'll quiet the release and a long

ball for or flat Bowl can be strung with
the<00:03:01.640> older<00:03:01.940> method<00:03:02.330> like<00:03:03.020> this<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:06.490> without
