hey<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.920> in<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.520> video<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:03.210> thought<00:00:03.510> I

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hey guys so in this video I thought I

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.550 
hey guys so in this video I thought I
would<00:00:03.959> show<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.740> set<00:00:05.700> up<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.560> crested

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
would show you how to set up a crested

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.680 
would show you how to set up a crested
gecko<00:00:07.890> tank<00:00:08.309> or<00:00:08.840> terrarium<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.099> can<00:00:11.309> see

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
gecko tank or terrarium as you can see

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.560 
gecko tank or terrarium as you can see
this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.320> 18<00:00:14.040> by<00:00:14.429> 18<00:00:14.790> by<00:00:15.540> 24<00:00:16.080> inch<00:00:16.680> tank

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
this is an 18 by 18 by 24 inch tank

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.679 
this is an 18 by 18 by 24 inch tank
which<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.859> large<00:00:20.189> sized<00:00:20.580> tank<00:00:21.029> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
which is a very large sized tank this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.500 
which is a very large sized tank this
could<00:00:21.930> easily<00:00:22.140> fit<00:00:22.800> two<00:00:22.970> adult<00:00:23.970> crested

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
could easily fit two adult crested

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.609 
could easily fit two adult crested
geckos<00:00:25.099> maybe<00:00:26.099> three<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.930> tell<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
geckos maybe three you can tell by the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550 
geckos maybe three you can tell by the
dimensions<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.119> taller<00:00:30.779> rather

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
dimensions that it is taller rather

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.150 
dimensions that it is taller rather
rather<00:00:32.279> than<00:00:32.550> longer<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.420> wider<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
rather than longer or wider this is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400 
rather than longer or wider this is
because<00:00:35.610> Preston<00:00:36.149> geckos<00:00:36.450> typically<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
because Preston geckos typically like to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.729 
because Preston geckos typically like to
be<00:00:37.530> suspended<00:00:38.219> inside<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:39.090> plants<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> trees

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
be suspended inside of plants and trees

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
be suspended inside of plants and trees
in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> environment<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.629> try<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
in the environment and so you do try to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.830 
in the environment and so you do try to
want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> try<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> recreate<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.809> inside<00:00:45.809> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
want to try to recreate that inside of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.700 
want to try to recreate that inside of
its<00:00:46.260> tank

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
its tank

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
its tank
therefore<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.340> definitely<00:00:47.940> always<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
therefore you definitely always want to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.770 
therefore you definitely always want to
shoot<00:00:48.930> before<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.410> tank<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.160> taller

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
shoot before a tank that is taller

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.459 
shoot before a tank that is taller
rather<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:52.379> wider<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
rather than wider so I

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.060 
rather than wider so I
the<00:00:56.559> answer<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.960> first<00:00:59.199> thing<00:00:59.559> that<00:00:59.590> I'm

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
the answer the first thing that I'm

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.340 
the answer the first thing that I'm
going<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.460> do<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.120> put<00:01:01.660> some

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
going to do is put some

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820 
going to do is put some
open<00:01:05.190> up<00:01:05.340> fight<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.850> substrate<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.930> this

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
open up fight or substrate in here this

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.990 
open up fight or substrate in here this
is<00:01:08.570> substrate<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.440> does<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.190> helps

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
is substrate but what it does is helps

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
is substrate but what it does is helps
keep<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> humidity<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.230> the<00:01:13.350> tank

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
keep the humidity in the tank

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.690 
keep the humidity in the tank
while<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:14.880> helping<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.980> care<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
while also helping to take care of the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080 
while also helping to take care of the
droppings<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.780> tank<00:01:19.550> just<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.700> fact<00:01:20.910> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
droppings in the tank just the fact that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.790 
droppings in the tank just the fact that
it<00:01:21.150> keeps<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.510> moisture<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.500> gives

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
it keeps the moisture and it also gives

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.450 
it keeps the moisture and it also gives
it<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.900> sort<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> naturalistic<00:01:25.590> feel<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it a good sort of naturalistic feel to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.210 
it a good sort of naturalistic feel to
it<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:27.600> long<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.440> not<00:01:28.620> feed<00:01:28.980> them

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it as long as you do not feed them

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
it as long as you do not feed them
crickets<00:01:29.540> inside<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.870> tank

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
crickets inside of the tank

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.560 
crickets inside of the tank
they're<00:01:31.920> usually<00:01:32.220> okay<00:01:32.940> so<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:34.050> go<00:01:34.260> ahead

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
they're usually okay so I will go ahead

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.040 
they're usually okay so I will go ahead
okay

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.470 

spread<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.130> out<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.220> one<00:01:45.520> does<00:01:45.850> come<00:01:46.000> with

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
spread that out this one does come with

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.510 
spread that out this one does come with
the<00:01:47.490> backing<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:49.690> kind<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.170> rough<00:01:50.680> sort<00:01:51.370> of

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the backing it's kind of rough sort of

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.600 
the backing it's kind of rough sort of
3d<00:01:52.830> styrofoam<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:56.290> do<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:57.280> a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
3d styrofoam and I do have this a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.240 
3d styrofoam and I do have this a
different<00:01:58.510> tank<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:58.960> had<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.530> they<00:02:00.040> did

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
different tank that I had and they did

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.680 
different tank that I had and they did
really<00:02:00.280> enjoy<00:02:02.070> having<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.100> background<00:02:03.550> so<00:02:04.360> I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
really enjoy having that background so I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.950 
really enjoy having that background so I
figured<00:02:05.080> I'd<00:02:05.200> go<00:02:05.380> ahead<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.660> now<00:02:07.660> I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
figured I'd go ahead and get that now I

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.420 
figured I'd go ahead and get that now I
would<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.440> mention<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.920> did<00:02:09.130> kind<00:02:09.399> of

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
would like to mention that I did kind of

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.370 
would like to mention that I did kind of
go<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.940> little<00:02:10.390> all<00:02:10.540> out<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.960> one<00:02:11.020> just

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
go a little all out on this one just

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.730 
go a little all out on this one just
because<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.210> going<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.990> my<00:02:14.380> geckos

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
because this is going to be my geckos

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.170 
because this is going to be my geckos
