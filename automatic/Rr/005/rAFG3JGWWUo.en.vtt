know I think we've lost a lot of that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.559 
know I think we've lost a lot of that
penpal<00:02:57.220> kind<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.849> thing<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.269> used<00:02:58.419> to

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
penpal kind of thing that we used to

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.509 
penpal kind of thing that we used to
have<00:02:58.750> we've<00:02:59.049> lost<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.470> lot<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.980> over<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
have we've lost a lot of that over the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.069

years<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:01.000> all<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.180> technology<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.049> I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
years with all the technology and I

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.069

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
Avenue up again having that exposure to

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.080 
Avenue up again having that exposure to
other<00:03:11.169> people's<00:03:11.680> perspectives<00:03:12.310> will<00:03:12.849> help

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
other people's perspectives will help

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.180 
other people's perspectives will help
students<00:03:13.569> create<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.139> kind<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.440> an<00:03:14.680> open<00:03:14.950> minded
