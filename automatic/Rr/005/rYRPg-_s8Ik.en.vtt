00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.830 

there's<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.850> midpoint<00:02:12.030> we're<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.570> good<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
there's a midpoint we're all the good it

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.980 
there's a midpoint we're all the good it
does<00:02:13.730> well<00:02:14.730> midpoint<00:02:15.120> while<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> good<00:02:15.720> mid

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990

before we can do it again we don't go

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.030 
before we can do it again we don't go
crazy<00:03:29.960> for<00:03:30.200> lying<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.470> over<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.710> place<00:03:30.860> with

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.940 

and<00:03:41.329> that's<00:03:41.480> where<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.689> midpoint<00:03:42.079> was<00:03:42.230> again

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
and that's where the midpoint was again

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.250 
and that's where the midpoint was again
for<00:03:43.159> all<00:03:43.219> the<00:03:43.340> good<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.549> would<00:03:43.609> do<00:03:43.790> me<00:03:43.939> oh<00:03:44.260> my

bounced off up a whole bunch of them in
a<00:03:56.320> row<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.500> wanted<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.070> there

alright<00:04:24.580> 91<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.180> what<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.419> should<00:04:25.479> have<00:04:25.689> at

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
alright 91 is what you should have at

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.989 
alright 91 is what you should have at
this<00:04:25.900> point<00:04:26.020> yeah<00:04:26.469> let's<00:04:27.370> go<00:04:27.550> back<00:04:27.759> to<00:04:27.879> the

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:27.999 
this point yeah let's go back to the

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.760 
this point yeah let's go back to the
change-up<00:04:28.030> room<00:04:28.659> one<00:04:28.960> more<00:04:29.169> time<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:32.650> should

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
change-up room one more time what should

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.260 
change-up room one more time what should
be<00:04:32.800> easier<00:04:33.159> this<00:04:33.249> time<00:04:33.310> since<00:04:33.849> we<00:04:33.999> have<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
be easier this time since we have the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.360 
be easier this time since we have the
room<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.900> don't<00:04:35.050> hello<00:04:37.860> no<00:04:38.860> you're<00:04:39.069> simply

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
room so we don't hello no you're simply

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.100 
room so we don't hello no you're simply
to<00:04:39.460> not<00:04:39.610> get<00:04:39.759> yet<00:04:39.969> so<00:04:40.270> having<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.900> room

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
to not get yet so having the room

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.619 
to not get yet so having the room
doesn't<00:04:41.289> really<00:04:41.469> help<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.710> doesn't<00:04:42.599> what<00:04:43.599> I

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
doesn't really help that doesn't what I

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:44.939 
doesn't really help that doesn't what I
suppose<00:04:43.840> we<00:04:43.930> could<00:04:44.050> do<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.439> don't<00:04:44.680> want<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.860> risk

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
suppose we could do I don't want to risk

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.529 
suppose we could do I don't want to risk
it<00:04:45.129> with<00:04:45.219> that<00:04:45.400> guy<00:04:45.550> there<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.969> was<00:04:46.180> guy<00:04:46.300> said<00:04:46.449> we

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
it with that guy there I was guy said we

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.390 
it with that guy there I was guy said we
could<00:04:46.659> do<00:04:46.749> a<00:04:46.779> turn<00:04:47.139> flight<00:04:47.560> thing<00:04:47.979> there<00:04:48.249> but

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
could do a turn flight thing there but
