basically<00:03:00.719> got<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.109> 66<00:03:01.739> motor<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.340> 66<00:03:02.849> rear

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
basically got the 66 motor in 66 rear

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.470 
basically got the 66 motor in 66 rear
end<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.019> frame<00:03:04.319> hood<00:03:04.909> electrics<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:07.219> 69

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
end and the frame hood electrics of a 69

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.390 
end and the frame hood electrics of a 69
in<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:10.439> it<00:03:10.560> works<00:03:10.739> pretty<00:03:10.859> well

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
in it and it works pretty well

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.860 
in it and it works pretty well
probably<00:03:12.299> needs<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> little<00:03:12.599> bit<00:03:12.750> of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
probably needs a little bit of

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.869 
probably needs a little bit of
adjustment<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.280> transmission<00:03:14.790> needs

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
adjustment I know the transmission needs

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.470 
adjustment I know the transmission needs
adjustment<00:03:16.250> my<00:03:17.250> locking<00:03:17.730> unit<00:03:18.030> isn't<00:03:18.299> really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
adjustment my locking unit isn't really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.199 
adjustment my locking unit isn't really
working<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.900> well<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:20.579> way<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.819> Justin

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
working that well and the way you Justin

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.819 
working that well and the way you Justin
is<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.450> take<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.810> nut<00:03:22.019> off<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.590> there's

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
is you take this nut off and there's

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.509 
is you take this nut off and there's
another<00:03:23.069> nut<00:03:23.310> behind<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:24.290> spinner<00:03:25.290> there<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
another nut behind the spinner there and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.819 
another nut behind the spinner there and
you<00:03:27.359> can<00:03:27.629> basically<00:03:28.109> what<00:03:28.469> you're<00:03:28.590> doing<00:03:28.620> is

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
you can basically what you're doing is

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.970 
you can basically what you're doing is
you're<00:03:28.980> playing<00:03:29.129> with<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> backlash<00:03:29.909> on<00:03:30.239> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
you're playing with the backlash on the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.509 
you're playing with the backlash on the
inside<00:03:31.980> shaft<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.829> could<00:03:34.980> adjust<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
inside shaft so you could adjust that to

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.240 
inside shaft so you could adjust that to
make<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.819> work<00:03:35.939> better<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:37.560> clutch<00:03:37.799> needs<00:03:38.189> a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
make it work better the clutch needs a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.659 
make it work better the clutch needs a
little<00:03:38.370> adjustment<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.000> does<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.359> brake<00:03:40.669> yeah

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
little adjustment as does the brake yeah

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.759 
little adjustment as does the brake yeah
it's<00:03:41.849> pretty<00:03:41.969> complete<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.379> guy<00:03:43.530> who<00:03:43.590> had<00:03:43.739> it

this I mean off of the TRA 10 d and I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.580 
this I mean off of the TRA 10 d and I
put<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.979> this<00:04:47.099> tra<00:04:47.400> 10<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:48.630> my

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
put it on to this tra 10 because my

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.320 
put it on to this tra 10 because my
governor<00:04:50.039> shaft<00:04:50.430> was<00:04:50.639> actually<00:04:50.940> bent<00:04:51.180> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
governor shaft was actually bent and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.790 
governor shaft was actually bent and
that's<00:04:51.449> why<00:04:51.570> my<00:04:51.750> governor<00:04:52.169> was<00:04:52.320> never<00:04:52.620> working

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800

always rev up really high so it's got

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.780 
always rev up really high so it's got

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.330 
engine speed it'll kick it down if I put
a<00:05:09.729> load<00:05:09.910> on<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.050> won't<00:05:11.139> speed<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.889> up<00:05:12.040> so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
a load on it but it won't speed it up so

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.240 
a load on it but it won't speed it up so
I<00:05:12.370> guess<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.790> still<00:05:12.910> need<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.210> adjust<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:14.250> but

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
I guess I still need to adjust that but

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.270 
I guess I still need to adjust that but
the<00:05:15.370> ant<00:05:15.520> meter<00:05:15.699> works<00:05:15.970> all<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.419> stuff<00:05:16.690> I

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
the ant meter works all that stuff I

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.439 
the ant meter works all that stuff I
don't<00:05:18.280> have<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.550> key<00:05:18.760> on<00:05:18.910> me<00:05:19.090> or<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.210> would

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
don't have the key on me or I would

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.900 
don't have the key on me or I would
start<00:05:20.139> it<00:05:20.320> but<00:05:20.919> everything<00:05:21.610> works<00:05:21.790> the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
start it but everything works the

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.510 
start it but everything works the
headlights<00:05:22.270> did<00:05:22.510> work<00:05:22.720> but<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:24.100> switch<00:05:24.340> was

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
headlights did work but the switch was

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.950 
headlights did work but the switch was
dead<00:05:24.699> so<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.000> just<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.330> of<00:05:25.360> put<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:25.720> other

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
dead so I just kind of put in this other

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.760 
dead so I just kind of put in this other
toggle<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.500> it

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
toggle on it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.650 
toggle on it
doesn't<00:05:27.220> really<00:05:27.280> work<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.580> great<00:05:28.030> as<00:05:28.539> you

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
doesn't really work that great as you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.120 
doesn't really work that great as you
can<00:05:28.780> see<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.020> got<00:05:29.139> a<00:05:29.169> small<00:05:29.410> car<00:05:29.620> battery<00:05:29.979> in

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
can see it's got a small car battery in

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.629 
can see it's got a small car battery in
it<00:05:30.280> as<00:05:30.550> opposed<00:05:30.940> to<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.150> tractor<00:05:31.630> bag<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:36.520> yeah

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
it as opposed to a tractor bag so yeah

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.689 
it as opposed to a tractor bag so yeah
that's<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.800> front<00:05:39.039> end<00:05:39.190> like<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.430> said<00:05:39.610> it's

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
that's it the front end like I said it's

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.100 
that's it the front end like I said it's
a<00:05:39.729> lot<00:05:39.880> tighter<00:05:40.150> on<00:05:40.360> this<00:05:40.479> one<00:05:40.660> which<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.900> really

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
a lot tighter on this one which I really

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.500 
a lot tighter on this one which I really
like<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:42.010> other<00:05:42.130> one<00:05:42.340> from<00:05:42.520> plowing<00:05:42.760> for<00:05:43.270> god
