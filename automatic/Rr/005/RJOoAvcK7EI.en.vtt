my<00:01:51.440> perspective<00:01:52.440> on<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.620> in<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.160> bit

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
my perspective on that in a little bit

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
my perspective on that in a little bit
of<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.900> right<00:01:55.050> now<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.560> year

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
of time but as of right now one year

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.370 
of time but as of right now one year
later<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.670> no<00:01:57.060> regrets<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.720> all<00:01:57.960> about

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
later I have no regrets at all about

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380 
later I have no regrets at all about
getting<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.770> tattoo<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.910> think<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.240> main

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
getting my tattoo and I think the main

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
getting my tattoo and I think the main
reason<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.410> I<00:02:01.530> waited<00:02:01.800> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
reason about that is that I waited a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370 
reason about that is that I waited a
while<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.910> when<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.660> turned<00:02:03.960> 18<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
while to get one when I turned 18 I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.320 
while to get one when I turned 18 I
really<00:02:04.800> wanted<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.160> get<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> tattoo<00:02:05.550> but<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.120> was

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
really wanted to get a tattoo but I was

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.719 
really wanted to get a tattoo but I was
18<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.900> mean<00:02:07.080> I've<00:02:07.230> changed<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> much<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:08.580> when

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
18 I mean I've changed so much from when

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
18 I mean I've changed so much from when
I<00:02:08.880> was<00:02:08.970> 18<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:09.960> 23<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.770> five<00:02:11.040> years

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
I was 18 and now I'm 23 so five years

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.030 
I was 18 and now I'm 23 so five years
I've<00:02:11.790> changed<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.750> drastically<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I've changed like drastically as a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.370 
I've changed like drastically as a
person<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> person<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.360> when<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.630> was<00:02:15.780> 18<00:02:15.930> is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
person the person I was when I was 18 is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980 
person the person I was when I was 18 is
nowhere<00:02:17.100> near<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.580> person<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.970> am<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.420> 23

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
nowhere near the person I am now at 23

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.870 
nowhere near the person I am now at 23
so<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> tattoo<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.310> 18<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
so if I was to get a tattoo at 18 I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.250 
so if I was to get a tattoo at 18 I
probably<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.720> got<00:02:21.870> something<00:02:22.200> I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
probably would have got something I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.390 
probably would have got something I
regretted<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.800> probably<00:02:23.040> would<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.280> got
