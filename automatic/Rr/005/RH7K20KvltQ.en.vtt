00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.380
 imagine for a moment that a chorus of 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.410
 angels sing in the bowels of the 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.410
 land 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.520
 I imagined that the classic sound of the past 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.279
 interlaza to two cultures the maya and the one of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.500
 austria thanks to the children singers of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 San FloriÃ¡n that as part of a tour 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.790
 for our country were presented in a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 magical natural scenery the living room of the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.849
 peace 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.370
 is a unique place is possibly the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.809
 most beautiful concert hall that you 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.420
 can you imagine 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.520
 big theaters small theaters no 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.040
 can achieve beauty and curiously 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.989
 nor acoustics because you can not compete 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.850
 with nature, nature is 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.079
 perfect and if you see it every training 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.079
 It is a work of art 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.000
 in cannes feeding pressure of 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.620
 immediate way a baby's appointment in this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.210
 jovial bato that 36 with almost a thousand years of 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.580
 history the children singers of san 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.860
 florian have been faithful ambassadors of 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 European music with the aim of 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.450
 bring joy to your audience 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 the message I believe is the encounter between 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.159
 culture that the peoples could 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.979
 find peace and with music is a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.899
 privilege is a privilege for god 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.469
 secret sharing an event so 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.960
 important not so subtle so so 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.670
 beautiful not so artistic and that's 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 our commitment to continue with these 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.869
 events to give to the community 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 this cultural aspect that has to 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 we have to develop all and that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.649
 so much we need not because both the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.340
 space sing in a church sing in 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.340
 an auditorium 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.220
 ah 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.260
 Austrian singing children and the hall of 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.270
 peace a musical memory that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.180
 undoubtedly enters through our ears 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.090
 and it stays in the hearts tablets of 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.830
 black music 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.260
 lately instruments get a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.260
 music store and stagnate 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 and not 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.020
 yes 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.510
 in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.510
 the land and the project 40 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.310
 with so much zeal 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.970
 I say no
