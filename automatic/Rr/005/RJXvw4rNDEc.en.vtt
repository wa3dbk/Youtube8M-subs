00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.049
 where exactly 250 years came the changes too 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.269
 in our world 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 he destroyed a large part of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.890
 civilization and killed several 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 billion people 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 many have died by his 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 violent but those who attacked them 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 survivors made it into his 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.420
 banish dimension 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 so that he never comes back here 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.230
 through a few remnants of his power 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.070
 another such came over the earth 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.110
 we call it end it remained transformed 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 almost all people in so-called ender 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.620
 wants to sign lohse big and slim 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.440
 rudi creatures do not daylight and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.649
 water can and that is mine 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.649
 history 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.850
 One day I found on my field 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.590
 something strange 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.989
 I had a closer look and 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.300
 seemed to be a kind of ender pearl 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.300
 I knew that it was different from each other 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 but I did not think so and so 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 Put it in the storage room 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.780
 it was already getting dark and therefore 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.260
 I decided to sleep first 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.570
 go 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.080
 I thought the day never came 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.080
 go to the end 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.360
 but in the night something seemed very 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.360
 strange to have happened 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.979
 it was a morning like any other 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.500
 Well, at least I thought that I would 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.560
 I thought in the mirror 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.409
 only what is in front of it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.869
 until I saw that I got used to it 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.369
 apparently the npd has something left 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.369
 my eye is doing 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.500
 I had to run down to the first 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 Storage room to see if the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.319
 ender pearl any changes 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.650
 you can see 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.190
 and indeed, some were to be seen 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 because she was gone I needed more over 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.100
 the edges commuter drive and over the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.380
 what happened to me 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.850
 So I was looking for a book that I could 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 Of course not so found 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.140
 Let's see what's nice inside 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.680
 this little book is my beloved 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.900
 son 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.510
 if you are reading this I am 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 probably long dead 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.659
 if you chose this book 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.530
 you probably have some 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:02.420
 noticed changes in your body 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.370
 pubic hair this is the ender place one man 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.909
 can only temporarily immunize him 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.950
 unless you have enough ingredients this 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.720
 I did not need it because I needed one 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.329
 Stockpile of antidote in the old 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:22.970
 hid and use the mill 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:25.639
 her before it is too late the day tended 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.159
 It came to an end and I was reading 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.700
 also tired, so I go fix times 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.700
 to bed 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 when I woke up the next day 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.550
 the changed further 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.340
 outspread 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 my skin slowly mutated into a kind 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.280
 black loud and I was sure 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.300
 I have to look for the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.300
 given a venom 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.000
 only I faced a small problem 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.420
 all the flash in the building were closer 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.810
 So I looked for it somewhere 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.870
 There was a kind of recipe book and indeed 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.780
 At the top of the mill was a book something 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.770
 a prescription went containing the antidote 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.440
 There you would need a bucket of water 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.320
 21 and each other pearl for the antidote 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.750
 make 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.850
 the only problem was of course that 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.350
 I none of them 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.030
 So I had to be okay or bad 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.030
 I was given the search for myself 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.850
 so that was my tv kiss trailer with 134 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.590
 Now consider it counts your vote 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.660
