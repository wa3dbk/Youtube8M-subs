00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> lot<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:00.780> you<00:00:00.989> wanted<00:00:01.350> me<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.530> go<00:00:01.770> pumpkin

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so a lot of you wanted me to go pumpkin

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.400 
so a lot of you wanted me to go pumpkin
hunting<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> 10-hour<00:00:03.720> lute<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:04.319> on

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hunting and make a 10-hour lute video on

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.220 
hunting and make a 10-hour lute video on
that<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.490> thought<00:00:05.670> okay<00:00:06.150> that's<00:00:06.720> actually

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
that and I thought okay that's actually

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.440 
that and I thought okay that's actually
a<00:00:07.259> good<00:00:07.470> idea<00:00:07.620> because<00:00:08.309> things<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:09.120> spawning

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
a good idea because things are spawning

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.780 
a good idea because things are spawning
at<00:00:09.719> random<00:00:10.080> locations<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.010> that's<00:00:11.219> exactly

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
at random locations and that's exactly

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.089 
at random locations and that's exactly
what<00:00:11.910> I'm<00:00:12.059> looking<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.950> instead<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
what I'm looking for and instead of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.430 
what I'm looking for and instead of
making<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.670> 10<00:00:14.910> hours<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.269> pumpkin<00:00:16.080> hunting

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
making a 10 hours of pumpkin hunting

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.640 
making a 10 hours of pumpkin hunting
what<00:00:17.010> happened<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.090> basically<00:00:18.480> made<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> 10

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
what happened is I basically made a 10

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.939 
what happened is I basically made a 10
hours<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.189> world<00:00:20.850> switching<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.830> end

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
hours of world switching and at the end

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
hours of world switching and at the end
I<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.490> receive<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> single<00:00:24.150> pumpkin<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I did not receive a single pumpkin and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.589 
I did not receive a single pumpkin and
probably<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> most<00:00:26.880> boring<00:00:27.180> thing

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
probably that was the most boring thing

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
probably that was the most boring thing
on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> runescape<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.769> yeah<00:00:29.670> there's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.000 
hunting as well but anyway this video is
about<00:00:44.370> giant<00:00:44.940> mole<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.809> why<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> hell<00:00:46.710> did<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
about giant mole so why the hell did I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
about giant mole so why the hell did I
choose<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> kill<00:00:47.670> giant<00:00:48.030> mold

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
choose to kill giant mold

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
choose to kill giant mold
I<00:00:48.629> mean<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.800> profitable

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I mean it's not like it's profitable

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
I mean it's not like it's profitable
nobody<00:00:51.090> kills<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
nobody kills it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.959 
nobody kills it
you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.410> annoying<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you know it's annoying and it's

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.959 
you know it's annoying and it's
basically<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> forgotten<00:00:55.170> boss<00:00:55.410> well<00:00:56.370> actually

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
basically a forgotten boss well actually

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.110 
basically a forgotten boss well actually
Jen<00:00:57.180> mole<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.140> last<00:00:58.379> boss<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.100> list<00:00:59.399> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
Jen mole was the last boss on my list so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.709 
Jen mole was the last boss on my list so
after<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.140> video<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:03.329> covered

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
after I make this video I I have covered

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
after I make this video I I have covered
every<00:01:04.080> single<00:01:04.229> boss<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> runescape<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
every single boss on the runescape so

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
every single boss on the runescape so
that<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> only<00:01:07.170> reason<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> made<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that is the only reason why I made this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
that is the only reason why I made this
video<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.939> knew<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
video I knew it's not going to be that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
video I knew it's not going to be that
profitable<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.310> was<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.820> curious<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
profitable I was actually curious a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
profitable I was actually curious a
little<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.439> loads<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.010> like

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
little bit on what loads gonna be like

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.149 
little bit on what loads gonna be like
so<00:01:14.610> we're<00:01:14.760> gonna<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.479> soon<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so we're gonna see it very soon and the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
so we're gonna see it very soon and the
most<00:01:17.369> efficient<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> kill<00:01:18.450> Jan<00:01:18.720> mole<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
most efficient way to kill Jan mole is I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.789 
most efficient way to kill Jan mole is I
found<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.470> better

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
found it well if you know any better

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.499 
found it well if you know any better
ways<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.330> better

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
ways I don't think there will be better

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.109 
ways I don't think there will be better
ways<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.560> best<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> use<00:01:26.880> in

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
ways but the best way is to use in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
ways but the best way is to use in
dragon<00:01:27.509> dagger<00:01:27.659> poisoned<00:01:28.350> preferably<00:01:29.189> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
dragon dagger poisoned preferably with

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.210 
dragon dagger poisoned preferably with
the<00:01:29.579> six<00:01:30.119> damage<00:01:30.570> poison<00:01:30.900> instead<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> four<00:01:32.070> or

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the six damage poison instead of four or

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.480 
the six damage poison instead of four or
five<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.869> use<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> ox<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:35.220> dad

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
five and then to use that ox because dad

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.620 
five and then to use that ox because dad
ox<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.210> good<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.960> Jan<00:01:37.229> mole<00:01:37.670> imagine<00:01:38.670> what

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
ox is so good at Jan mole imagine what

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
ox is so good at Jan mole imagine what
would<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> prefer<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.710> hit<00:01:40.860> three<00:01:41.189> hits<00:01:41.400> with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
would you prefer to hit three hits with

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
would you prefer to hit three hits with
a<00:01:41.640> Bissell<00:01:42.060> whip<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.560> Jan<00:01:43.799> mole

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
a Bissell whip and then the Jan mole

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.219 
a Bissell whip and then the Jan mole
would<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.670> buddy<00:01:44.970> down<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.509> ground<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
would will buddy down the ground and it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
would will buddy down the ground and it
will<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> find<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> prefer

buddy<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.950> basically<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.119> trying

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
buddy down but basically what I'm trying

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
buddy down but basically what I'm trying
to<00:01:57.450> say<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> weapon<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to say you have to use a weapon that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
to say you have to use a weapon that
hits<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.670> most<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.600> fastest<00:02:01.170> weapon<00:02:01.560> but

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
hits the most not the fastest weapon but

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580 
hits the most not the fastest weapon but
it<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.549> slowest<00:02:03.180> weapon<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.380> has

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it can be the slowest weapon but it has

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.940 
it can be the slowest weapon but it has
to<00:02:04.770> hit<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.100> lot<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.049> what<00:02:07.049> frequently<00:02:07.590> that's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to hit a lot and what frequently that's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
to hit a lot and what frequently that's
