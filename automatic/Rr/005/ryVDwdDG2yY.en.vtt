00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.830
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.600
 android mod 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.490
 today I want to explain to you how to install 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.340
 the light effect on the screen 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.550
 lock of the galaxy s 4 was other galaxy 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.700
 the mode is compatible with the galaxy s ii 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.040
 the galaxy s iii the galaxy note the note 2 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.560
 and the effect works on all roms 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.779
 the only requirement is to have one 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.760
 modified recovery to flash the i 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.440
 packages before proceeding with 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.300
 installation I recommend 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.070
 make a nandroid backup 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.990
 so in case you don't like it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.640
 the effect you could return to 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.160
 original situation 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 ok once the nandroid is finished we could 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 start with the installation before 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.890
 all in description you will find the links 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.800
 corresponding to the devices 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.840
 compatible from the links you will have to download i 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.970
 two packages that you find under bild 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.470
 and to the mode item and insert them into yours 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.090
 device 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.760
 these are the two packages you will need 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.350
 flashing a thing through recovery 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.420
 important is the order in which them 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.950
 installed first of all 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.880
 we need to flash this second 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.009
 package and then this other 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.500
 you will have to flash it in this order if not 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.600
 the mode will not work if you want 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.250
 I quickly flash the two packages 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 I advise you to download the application 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.630
 free nandroid manager 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.750
 from here you can just go to the section 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.429
 shelters and select flash zip 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.170
 at this point, all you have to do is 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.780
 add the two packages you have 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.720
 downloaded paying attention to the order 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 so before s4 and then remove once 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 Once the packages have arrived it will be enough to start 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.390
 flash and will do all the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.330
 device will enter shelters 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.189
 will install the zip and restart at 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.170
 this step the procedure is completed e 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.630
 you will find yourself with the light effect 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.459
 of axis 4 together with the two packages yes 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.429
 it also installs the audio effect then 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.429
 turn up the volume and go try it 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.060
 as you can see the effect is really a lot 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.190
 cute and animations are fluid and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.470
 therefore take care from this point of view 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.970
 there are no problems in case 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
 the light effect does not work 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.410
 you will have to go into the settings of 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.959
 system in those for the screen of 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.360
 block and disable the effect 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.400
 ripple as you see it is not me 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.989
 highlighted despite there being the tick 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.170
 this was because it was deactivated 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.129
 automatically perfect this for today 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.720
 that's all 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.420
