00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
yet the electric engine of course is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.070 
yet the electric engine of course is
driving<00:00:46.040> it<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:46.580> can<00:00:46.760> switch<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.330> all<00:00:47.630> gas

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
driving it we can switch to the all gas

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.040 
driving it we can switch to the all gas
version<00:00:48.590> by<00:00:48.740> moving<00:00:49.370> it<00:00:49.460> into<00:00:49.610> sport<00:00:50.180> now<00:00:50.660> look

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
version by moving it into sport now look

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.350 
version by moving it into sport now look
at<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:51.410> it's<00:00:51.950> already<00:00:52.100> telling<00:00:52.910> us<00:00:53.059> we're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
is yet to be seen but let's check out

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.190 
is yet to be seen but let's check out
the<00:01:13.690> hybrid<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.710> ate<00:01:15.580> from<00:01:15.880> BMW<00:01:16.180> obviously<00:01:16.869> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the hybrid I ate from BMW obviously to

gull<00:01:18.100> wing<00:01:18.369> doors<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.270> electric

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
gull wing doors this is the electric

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.359 
gull wing doors this is the electric
test<00:01:19.930> vehicle<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:20.470> it's<00:01:20.619> not<00:01:20.770> really<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
test vehicle so it's not really the

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.639 
test vehicle so it's not really the
production<00:01:21.880> commercial<00:01:22.450> model<00:01:22.960> just<00:01:23.200> yet<00:01:23.409> you

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
production commercial model just yet you

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.010 
production commercial model just yet you
can<00:01:23.800> see<00:01:23.979> here<00:01:24.220> look<00:01:24.340> at<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:25.020> carbon-fiber

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
can see here look at this carbon-fiber

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.510 
can see here look at this carbon-fiber
body<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:28.090> it's<00:01:28.270> fairly<00:01:28.570> light<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
body so it's fairly light and in the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940 
body so it's fairly light and in the
front<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> electric<00:01:31.960> engine<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.649> this<00:01:32.770> is

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
front is the electric engine and this is

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.300 
front is the electric engine and this is
the<00:01:33.070> charging<00:01:33.520> station<00:01:34.030> now<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.100> see

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
the charging station now you can see

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.510 
the charging station now you can see
just<00:01:36.789> fairly<00:01:37.060> straightforward<00:01:37.990> just<00:01:38.800> plug

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
just fairly straightforward just plug

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.060 
just fairly straightforward just plug
and<00:01:39.880> play<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.630> range<00:01:40.929> anxiety<00:01:41.200> though<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
and play the range anxiety though is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.889 
and play the range anxiety though is
something<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.820> considered<00:01:43.300> especially<00:01:43.539> in

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
something to be considered especially in

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.080 
something to be considered especially in
Beijing<00:01:44.380> because<00:01:44.830> we<00:01:45.190> don't<00:01:45.399> have<00:01:45.460> these<00:01:45.850> in

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
Beijing because we don't have these in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.940 
Beijing because we don't have these in
the<00:01:46.420> high-rise<00:01:46.899> buildings<00:01:47.440> you're<00:01:47.740> going<00:01:47.890> to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the high-rise buildings you're going to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.469 
the high-rise buildings you're going to
have<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.130> have<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> pretty<00:01:48.610> long<00:01:48.820> extension

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
have to have a pretty long extension

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.469 
have to have a pretty long extension
cord<00:01:49.509> up<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.050> your<00:01:50.229> 30th<00:01:51.039> floor<00:01:51.250> apartment<00:01:52.119> but

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
cord up to your 30th floor apartment but

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.570 
cord up to your 30th floor apartment but
this<00:01:52.720> car<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.320> good<00:01:53.470> thing<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.770> guess<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.280> it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
this car the good thing I guess is it's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.700 
this car the good thing I guess is it's
a<00:01:54.759> hybrid<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.539> has<00:01:55.720> both<00:01:55.929> an<00:01:56.259> electric

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
a hybrid so it has both an electric

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.639 
a hybrid so it has both an electric
engine<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.250> front<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.670> then<00:01:58.270> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
engine in the front and then a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.010 
engine in the front and then a
twin-turbo<00:01:59.649> 3<00:01:59.890> cylinder<00:02:00.399> peppy<00:02:00.850> engine<00:02:01.840> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
twin-turbo 3 cylinder peppy engine in

twin-turbo 3 cylinder peppy engine in
the<00:02:02.229> back<00:02:02.380> petrol<00:02:02.890> engine<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.460> will<00:02:03.820> get<00:02:04.030> you

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
the back petrol engine that will get you

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.870 
the back petrol engine that will get you
they<00:02:04.479> say<00:02:04.840> 0<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.979> 60<00:02:06.460> in<00:02:06.869> 4.5<00:02:08.040> seconds<00:02:09.100> an<00:02:09.190> i8<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
they say 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds an i8 is

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.569
