00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 well a few days ago I went shopping and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.919
 I remembered that I have not done them for a long time 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.559
 a shopping video and that you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240
 they like it so I'm going to show you what 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.849
 buy because I took advantage of that they had 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 too many offers so we're going to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 start one of the things you buy 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.750
 were these cotton swabs that have the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.670
 tipita so super finite to help me 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.560
 When I paint my nails it's been a long time 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.359
 I do not paint them and then when they are 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
 the redonditos when I tried to clean 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.790
 well with acetone and if it happens a little bit 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.040
 then pieces of my nail are painted 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.809
 so when I saw this I said I have to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.360
 have it aside because I feel like I'm going to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.579
 last a lot in these moments of my 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 life I'm obsessed with coral and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.050
 another one of the things that I bought then from 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 enamel without full color is that I loved it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.309
 it is divine for spring-summer 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.559
 really for any time of the year 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 the coral is beautiful but especially 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.690
 in spring and summer and then this can 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 another thing that I bought and another thing was 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 this labial de l'oréal that really 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 I only bought it because I liked the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 color and I feel that I have not tasted well 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 labial de l'oreal so come on 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.530
 this base I want to try from 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.040
 it does a lot especially for you and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 also for me it is the umi de l'oréal that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.660
 I 'm supposed to leave you a finish so 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.570
 the skin you see all healthy juices and is 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.930
 pretty and what I like about l'oréal is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.090
 that in their bases they have as well as when 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 I was choosing this I was telling you for shades 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.650
 warm for cool tones and for tones 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 neutral then choose the base is a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.450
 little easier than with other 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 companies have compared it a lot with 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.310
 this one that I have here of cool is the one that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 love it but it's quite expensive so if 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 is doing the same thing that is so that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 boston on this so be out of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.649
 another thing that I buy and if they want a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.660
 review of this let me know please 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.910
 in the comments another thing that I bought 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.920
 was this as a spray cream that the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.310
 I bought simply because I was intrigued 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.649
 a lot and because if sometimes when I go out 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.289
 to bathe I do not wear body cream 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.170
 because I'm going fast and all of that 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.979
 wait for it to dry and all then 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.000
 and you can spray it and that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.069
 you can get dressed and continue with your life 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.290
 and that vanilla smell in fact the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.660
 I really have a lot of doubt let's see if 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.660
 I can open it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 how 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.660
 says it smells like vanilla 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.760
 the vanilla but it does not smell bad and 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.280
 really if I feel that it was absorbed 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.099
 pretty fast so I'll try it and I'll 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.409
 We see what you think glaze over because 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.970
 It's like spring and summer that I 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.280
 they start to give I think that more desire to 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.379
 paint my nails and I bought this one 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.049
 revlon know that this line of revlon me 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.299
 love and fascinate me is a color 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.879
 It's very beautiful like that I do not know if it's just 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.569
 a very beautiful color is based and this other 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.519
 of revlon that I simply do not have 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.290
 words for this enamel is very nice 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.170
 I do not feel it's something I would use from 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.790
 daily but then every once in a while all 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.060
 we need a funny glaze and 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.530
 I feel that this enamel is beautiful 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.150
 probably these two and the other 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.519
 also of simple color if they see you 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.060
 soon on the blog another thing that I bought 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.340
 it was this dust of l'oreal I bought it more 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.220
 well because I had already tried before 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.319
 one years ago the powders of l'oréal and me 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.569
 they loved and right now I still wanted to 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.909
 bronzer and then I said that now I 'm going to 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.050
 go to some shades darker than my 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.300
 skin and apart 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.850
 totally matte and it's a powder that I know that 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.320
 I like it so let's see if it works 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.870
 for what I want to work for me 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.840
 I think so, but we'll see almost 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.880
 last I also bought this eyeliner 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.780
 maybelline over and follow those is not 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.510
 I have not mentioned this occasion 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.040
 but I'm going to leave them 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.710
 bar information if you want to see 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.170
 I did a review of the delineators in 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.480
 maybelline pencil that they make me 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.120

 try the liquid liner of milani and 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.570
 Well, I was hungry to try more 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.870
 liquid eyeliners and then I went with 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.019

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.730
