00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and there is a lot left to see me and he stayed 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.890
 I like what captivated me the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.890
 Andalusians and the hair 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.910
 a favor what came after not what 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 you say I was really drunk there 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.050
 how come my people men 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.710
 let's not put it I think 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 because even the Basque 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.800
 they had never kissed her well either 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.800
 what 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:45.129
 once a fatal very bad very bad many 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.129
 with a lot of work a little getting used to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.390
 But passion will I get drunk 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 nothing that can not be solved 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.239
 and is that in my eyes exploded in 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.770
 Basque but let's see that once 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.920
 you wear the first impression that I have not 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.030
 been already everything goes great amaya to me 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 this has not been a here I catch you here you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.170
 I understand you understand and here I catch you here 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.490
 I kill as an expression speaks 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 sense and it presents itself in my town 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.050
 you lower for other things and 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.340
 I am very pointer but part of the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.860
 joke the truth that little grace of a 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.600
 in love is already the myths also you 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.259
 I say that I would see the winds of the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 everything for her yes yes yes is something else is 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.160
 very typical of the most expensive girls that and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.200
 cut the fringe that seems to be 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.979
 a true ax 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.080
 they are very secondary things, I see it 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.030
 what is this that this is going well is everything 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.679
 even shots but a kiss with 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.729
 sight language fa do not even think of the 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:54.399
 second out your Basque surnames chorus 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.399
 every day and manquepierda only in cinemas
