the balls is 67 millimeters in diameter
which<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> roughly<00:01:00.750> around<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> size<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
which is roughly around the size of a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
which is roughly around the size of a
tennis<00:01:01.710> ball<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> lot

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
tennis ball which is actually a lot

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.299 
tennis ball which is actually a lot
better<00:01:04.049> than<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> three<00:01:04.650> inch<00:01:04.799> balls<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
better than the three inch balls of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
better than the three inch balls of
these<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:06.530> preference<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> have

small<00:01:08.880> hands<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.540> dislike<00:01:09.930> smaller<00:01:10.229> balls

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

the shell itself is actually really

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
the shell itself is actually really
really<00:01:33.750> thin<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> see

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
really thin I don't know if you can see

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
really thin I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.159> camera<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.600> really

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that on camera but it's really really

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.749 
that on camera but it's really really
thin<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> millet<00:01:38.220> clear<00:01:38.610> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
thin you can see the millet clear as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
thin you can see the millet clear as
days<00:01:39.000> through<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> actual<00:01:39.960> surface<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.470> the

days through the actual surface of the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.429 
days through the actual surface of the
ball<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:41.640> seen<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.170> hinder<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
ball doesn't seen the hinder the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
ball doesn't seen the hinder the
durability<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> bowls<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.030> I've<00:01:45.149> had

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
durability of the bowls at all I've had

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.399 
durability of the bowls at all I've had
these<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> while<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.020> haven't<00:01:46.200> got

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
these for a while and they haven't got

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
these for a while and they haven't got
rekt<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.759> still<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.119> durable

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
rekt at all so it's still really durable

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
rekt at all so it's still really durable
but<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.490> seed

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
but you can actually see the seed

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
away they will go back to normal but you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.809 
away they will go back to normal but you

know you don't have to give them time so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.190 
know you don't have to give them time so
that's<00:02:27.330> something<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.900> keep<00:02:28.050> in

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
a little bit of that ink will actually

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.420 
a little bit of that ink will actually
stay<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.049> ball<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> even<00:02:47.040> happened<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
stay on the ball and it even happened to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.370

better<00:03:39.690> than<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.049> sellers<00:03:40.380> implosion<00:03:40.769> or

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
better than the sellers implosion or

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.210 
better than the sellers implosion or
probably<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.450> Stoics<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:42.989> general<00:03:43.440> consider

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
probably the Stoics in general consider

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.319 
probably the Stoics in general consider
that<00:03:44.609> they're<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.060> heavy<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.260> full<00:03:46.680> millet

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
that they're so heavy and so full millet

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.170 
that they're so heavy and so full millet
when<00:03:48.329> they<00:03:48.480> fall<00:03:48.750> they<00:03:49.700> pretty<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:50.910> fall

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
when they fall they pretty much fall

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210 
when they fall they pretty much fall
where<00:03:51.359> they<00:03:51.480> fall<00:03:51.709> you're<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.769> going<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.069> have

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
where they fall you're not going to have

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.550 
where they fall you're not going to have
more<00:03:53.430> than<00:03:53.639> one<00:03:53.880> two<00:03:54.060> three<00:03:54.569> feed<00:03:54.870> rolls<00:03:55.230> with

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
more than one two three feed rolls with

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.129 
more than one two three feed rolls with
these<00:03:55.680> balls<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.340> most<00:03:56.519> cases<00:03:56.849> even<00:03:57.840> off<00:03:57.959> of

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
these balls in most cases even off of

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.539 
these balls in most cases even off of
collisions<00:03:58.620> they<00:03:59.609> pretty<00:03:59.849> much<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.590> fall<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
collisions they pretty much just fall so

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.400 
collisions they pretty much just fall so
let<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.910> benefit<00:04:03.329> with<00:04:03.480> these<00:04:03.599> balls

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.010 

and<00:04:07.730> again<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.150> other<00:04:09.300> benefit<00:04:09.780> with<00:04:09.900> these

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
and again the other benefit with these

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.400 
and again the other benefit with these
balls<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.830> size<00:04:11.300> itself<00:04:12.300> makes<00:04:13.140> for

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
balls is just the size itself makes for

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:23.090 
balls is just the size itself makes for
a<00:04:13.440> lot<00:04:13.650> easier<00:04:14.810> juggling<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:21.390> then<00:04:22.260> for<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
a lot easier juggling and then for the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.180 
a lot easier juggling and then for the
disadvantages<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:25.290> main<00:04:25.470> disadvantage<00:04:26.100> of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
disadvantages the main disadvantage of

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.100 
disadvantages the main disadvantage of
these<00:04:26.310> balls<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.680> weight<00:04:29.660> at<00:04:30.660> least<00:04:30.870> for

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
these balls of the weight at least for

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.810 
these balls of the weight at least for
me<00:04:31.580> 135<00:04:32.580> grams<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:34.140> lot<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.800> juggle<00:04:35.070> when

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
me 135 grams is a lot to juggle when

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.620 
me 135 grams is a lot to juggle when
you're<00:04:35.940> trying<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.420> 5<00:04:36.750> balls<00:04:38.330> at<00:04:39.330> first

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
you're trying to do 5 balls at first

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.300 
you're trying to do 5 balls at first
you're<00:04:39.840> going<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.020> feel<00:04:40.230> very<00:04:40.260> energized<00:04:40.980> and

you're going to go up and again start
juggling<00:04:42.570> five<00:04:42.900> balls<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:45.240> then<00:04:45.420> within<00:04:45.660> like

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
juggling five balls and then within like

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.920 
juggling five balls and then within like
100<00:04:46.380> run<00:04:47.150> start<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.270> get<00:04:48.420> really<00:04:48.750> really

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
100 run start to get really really

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.910 
100 run start to get really really
tighter<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:50.480> it's<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.780> know<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.380> lot<00:04:52.800> of

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
tighter and it's you know just a lot of

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.250 
tighter and it's you know just a lot of
strain<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.310> muffled<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.750> mean<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.020> guess

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
strain on the muffled and I mean I guess

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.790 
strain on the muffled and I mean I guess
if<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.560> work<00:04:55.740> out<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.950> jason<00:04:56.460> Garfield<00:04:56.910> or<00:04:57.800> you

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
if you work out a jason Garfield or you

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.380 
if you work out a jason Garfield or you
know<00:04:58.890> something<00:04:59.220> like<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.490> you<00:05:00.000> may<00:05:00.150> be<00:05:00.210> able

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
know something like that you may be able

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.540 
know something like that you may be able
to<00:05:00.510> juggle<00:05:00.720> these<00:05:00.960> without<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.200> problem<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:02.520> I

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
to juggle these without a problem but I

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.130 
to juggle these without a problem but I
found<00:05:02.910> that<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.270> makes<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.690> extremely

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
found that it makes it extremely

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.640 
found that it makes it extremely
difficult<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.920> practice<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.760> patterns

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
difficult to practice a lot of patterns

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.140 
difficult to practice a lot of patterns
because<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.130> weight<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> ball<00:05:08.820> you

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
because of the weight of the ball you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.480 
because of the weight of the ball you
saw<00:05:09.930> me<00:05:10.080> last<00:05:10.260> time<00:05:10.530> with<00:05:10.680> implosion<00:05:11.280> talk

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
saw me last time with implosion talk

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.280 
saw me last time with implosion talk
about<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.820> size<00:05:12.060> hindering<00:05:12.660> performance

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
about the size hindering performance

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.420 
about the size hindering performance
these<00:05:13.950> are<00:05:14.669> hinder<00:05:14.970> advises<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.750> weight<00:05:16.430> some

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
these are hinder advises the weight some

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.800 
these are hinder advises the weight some
people<00:05:17.730> say<00:05:17.940> that's<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> perfect<00:05:18.510> weight<00:05:18.780> for

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
people say that's the perfect weight for

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.960 
people say that's the perfect weight for
juggling<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.130> feel<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.550> way

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
juggling and it's you feel that way

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.300 
juggling and it's you feel that way
Congrats<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:22.050> wish<00:05:22.290> I<00:05:22.380> felt<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.710> same<00:05:22.950> but<00:05:23.190> I

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310

Congrats I wish I felt the same but I
don't<00:05:23.640> if<00:05:24.390> these<00:05:24.600> were<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> bit<00:05:25.110> lighter<00:05:25.410> I

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
don't if these were a bit lighter I

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.000 
don't if these were a bit lighter I
would<00:05:26.610> recommend<00:05:27.390> these<00:05:27.480> for<00:05:27.720> everybody<00:05:28.200> the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
would recommend these for everybody the

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.460 
would recommend these for everybody the
sense<00:05:29.250> or<00:05:29.430> not<00:05:29.900> it's<00:05:30.900> kind<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.320> 50/50<00:05:31.830> for<00:05:32.220> me

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
sense or not it's kind of a 50/50 for me

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.080 
sense or not it's kind of a 50/50 for me
it<00:05:34.470> makes<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.860> very<00:05:34.950> difficult<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.669> do<00:05:35.820> things

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
it makes it very difficult to do things

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.260 
it makes it very difficult to do things
like<00:05:36.210> spats<00:05:37.490> I've<00:05:38.490> had<00:05:38.790> these<00:05:38.940> for<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.210> while

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.640 
but with these I have a very hard
difficulty<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.780> it's<00:05:54.990> one<00:05:55.169> thing<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.410> want<00:05:55.620> to

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
difficulty so it's one thing you want to

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.780 
difficulty so it's one thing you want to
keep<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:55.980> mind<00:05:57.169> other<00:05:58.169> than<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.680> though<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:59.220> do

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
keep in mind other than that though I do

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.240 
keep in mind other than that though I do
still<00:06:00.660> recommend<00:06:00.780> these<00:06:01.140> balls<00:06:01.440> if<00:06:02.010> you're

looking for something different than the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.990
