00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 in that line the president of usa 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.240
 he was very attentive to the drift 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.499
 get to that ball 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.599
 can play well sergio ramos the pole goes for the right joaquin back 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 concha saw the one he received and is iniesta 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.340
 ii is again with Chavez ahead of Cesc Fabregas that triangle 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.390
 that the Spanish team has in the midfield 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 marchena marchena's ball with capdevila lacks a bit of nerves 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.609
 little bit of speed in the game 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 the one of spain that this one treats is that they treat 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.570
 and impose the Aragonese Luis to vote because the only thing that is hitting the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 same 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950
 I think that after the grandstand was heard then 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
 attention at any price the ball of chavín 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.840
 this sergio bouquets sergio bouquets with cesc fabregas 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 it was Cáceres to the opening to the left for capdevila 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.150
 capdevila with marchena now they are all very standing in front of marchena 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.620
 away from home although it is possible that the church in Spain has done it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.960
 we are in the front and then the first part and then the motorcycle 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 Spain is winning Denmark by the floor 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420
 it seemed unthinkable and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 he knows how much love 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 all spain except 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.840
 all that region 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.420
 let's name 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 has arrived sergio ramos will pass on Saturday 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.500
 marked sergio 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 for this year it's all 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.070
 good thing is that when we break 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 the 18 possible other elements 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 before the close of your financial year 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 notimex 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 the decision occurs that sector 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 fantastic sergio 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 now in your account as 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.380
 number 27 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740
 and it's just that he got the second goal in Spain what he told you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 since that day everything is face 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.290
