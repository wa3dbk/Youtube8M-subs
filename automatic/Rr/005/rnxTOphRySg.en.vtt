00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello everyone here you togo pro presented 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.060
 by thomas in this video we're going 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.789
 see a new series that is named 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.349
 gopro studio 2.0 for dummies so everything 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.699
 right now I tell you I insult you 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.919
 not two draws but I was offered 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.730
 do this kind like the books that 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.739
 are for dummies 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.570
 I find this concept rather not bad so 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.399
 we will launch this series of how 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.129
 use gopro studio so you have 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.379
 already three columns so the first one which 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.760
 allows you to bring your file 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.980
 so you're going to click on the little 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 no longer choose your gopro file well 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 heard then you will see below 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.390
 the settings which therefore has 1920 by 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.399
 1080 the time of your video and that's 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 so here what are you going to do here at 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.879
 environment is to choose or wanted 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.859
 cut your video unless your 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 video is well cut it's up to you to 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.449
 see 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 in any case I'm going to cut here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.069
 so we press the small and left 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.860
 and then we choose the end of our 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.049
 video so we press him right 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 so here after we have other settings 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.670
 who are rather nice like the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.080
 rotation of a clip that is very 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 important finally you can not put 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.550
 the copro at the place you have of course 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 qualities in at 27 cings so the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.360
 put in better quality why not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.020
 very important their anthem to the files 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.940
 I was asked 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 so it's to remove the flare on the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 gopro but hey I do not see too much 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 utility since the gopro l made a 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.540
 little for that you can speed up to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.580
 videos and you can change your 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 image seconds the motion blur so who 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 allows to make slow motion 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 motion could change the quality of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 your video 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 then as soon as that is done you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 can change the name of your 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 file so I'm going to call it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 pool tests and after that right now 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.860
 that your video you feel that she is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 ready you can put it in the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 comet converted to list so then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.950
 after you have just pressed 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.360
 convert and basically she will cut and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.790
 it will set according to the settings 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.800
 what you chose your conversion 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.770
 just here so she'll stay here after 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 a year ballu of conversion we will have written 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 proceed to step number 2 that we will see 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.250
