00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
is that you are a complete vibrational

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.350 
is that you are a complete vibrational
match<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.429> presenting<00:02:09.060> in

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
other words if you don't believe your

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.720 
other words if you don't believe your
character<00:02:11.760> no<00:02:12.629> one<00:02:12.780> else<00:02:12.959> will<00:02:13.230> either

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
character no one else will either

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900 
character no one else will either
so<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.540> more<00:02:15.780> about<00:02:16.050> identifying<00:02:16.770> who<00:02:17.730> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so it is more about identifying who this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.089 
so it is more about identifying who this
character<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.620> character<00:02:19.890> feels

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
character is how this character feels

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.809 
character is how this character feels
because<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.550> character<00:02:24.090> will<00:02:25.340> find<00:02:26.340> his<00:02:26.580> own

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
because the character will find his own

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.740 
because the character will find his own
way<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:27.360> behaving<00:02:27.810> once<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.190> understood

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
way of behaving once that is understood

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.960
