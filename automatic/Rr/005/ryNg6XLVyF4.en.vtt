my goodness the predecessor to
Battlefield<00:07:32.410> I<00:07:32.740> found<00:07:33.669> it<00:07:34.200> fuck<00:07:35.200> all<00:07:35.380> the

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
Battlefield I found it fuck all the

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.310 
Battlefield I found it fuck all the
little<00:07:35.890> logs<00:07:36.100> here<00:07:36.610> and<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:37.630> city<00:07:37.900> is<00:07:38.020> just

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.320 
little logs here and the city is just

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.000 
little logs here and the city is just
above<00:07:38.560> this<00:07:38.770> 90-degree<00:07:39.460> angle<00:07:40.890> usually<00:07:41.890> when

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010 
above this 90-degree angle usually when

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.260 
above this 90-degree angle usually when
you're<00:07:42.160> entering<00:07:42.430> the<00:07:42.520> city<00:07:42.820> you<00:07:42.970> have<00:07:43.000> to

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270 
you're entering the city you have to

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.120 
you're entering the city you have to
scale<00:07:43.540> a<00:07:43.570> 90-degree<00:07:44.260> angle<00:07:44.290> so<00:07:44.740> I'm<00:07:44.830> glad<00:07:44.979> that

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.130 
scale a 90-degree angle so I'm glad that

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.070 
scale a 90-degree angle so I'm glad that
they<00:07:45.400> included<00:07:45.820> that<00:07:45.970> realism<00:07:46.450> in<00:07:46.690> here<00:07:46.870> too

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 
they included that realism in here too

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.260 
they included that realism in here too
but<00:07:47.290> I<00:07:47.979> guess<00:07:48.160> the<00:07:48.310> city<00:07:48.550> is<00:07:48.640> closed<00:07:48.970> for<00:07:49.240> the

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270 
but I guess the city is closed for the

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.140 
but I guess the city is closed for the
day<00:07:49.510> so<00:07:49.620> that's<00:07:50.620> fine<00:07:50.919> well<00:07:51.669> that's<00:07:51.880> the<00:07:52.090> end

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.150 
day so that's fine well that's the end

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.790 
day so that's fine well that's the end
