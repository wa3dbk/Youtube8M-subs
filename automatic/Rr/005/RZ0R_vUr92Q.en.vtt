bamboo<00:00:02.669> here<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.090> stuff<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.510> very<00:00:03.899> dirty

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
bamboo here this stuff it's very dirty

bamboo here this stuff it's very dirty
they<00:00:04.740> are<00:00:04.799> strong<00:00:12.380> together

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.279 

I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:28.119> they<00:00:28.300> actually<00:00:28.359> misunderstood<00:00:29.259> I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
I think they actually misunderstood I

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.749 
I think they actually misunderstood I
thought<00:00:29.590> they<00:00:29.710> were<00:00:29.769> putting<00:00:29.949> together<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.369> kit

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.460 
thought they were putting together a kit
they're<00:00:31.390> doing<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.810> whole<00:00:32.050> thing<00:00:32.290> from

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
they're doing this whole thing from

00:00:32.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
they're doing this whole thing from
scratch<00:00:32.710> here<00:00:33.300> there's<00:00:34.300> no<00:00:34.540> one<00:00:34.720> kid<00:00:35.140> about<00:00:35.440> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.100 

now<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.670> one<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:13.970> looks<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:14.540> reasonably

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
now this one here looks like reasonably

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.630 
now this one here looks like reasonably
close<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.560> ground<00:01:15.920> I've<00:01:16.130> seen<00:01:16.340> some<00:01:16.550> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
close to the ground I've seen some of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.700 
close to the ground I've seen some of
them<00:01:16.730> up<00:01:16.940> three<00:01:17.870> or<00:01:17.930> four<00:01:18.140> foot<00:01:18.350> off<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
them up three or four foot off the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.390 
them up three or four foot off the
ground<00:01:18.830> even<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:20.380> think<00:01:21.380> they<00:01:21.710> do<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.950> in

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
ground even I think they do that in

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.310 
ground even I think they do that in
areas<00:01:22.760> where<00:01:22.940> there's<00:01:23.150> more<00:01:23.360> bugs<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.200> I'm

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
areas where there's more bugs but I'm

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.280 
areas where there's more bugs but I'm

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
not sure I've seen him up on the stilts

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.840 
not sure I've seen him up on the stilts

Chrissa just told me if there's any kind

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
Chrissa just told me if there's any kind
of<00:02:45.989> design<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.500> pattern<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.400> anything<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.820> find

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
of design or pattern or anything I find

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.890 
of design or pattern or anything I find
out<00:02:48.390> there<00:02:48.630> he<00:02:48.720> probably<00:02:48.959> could<00:02:49.230> build<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
out there he probably could build it so

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
out there he probably could build it so
