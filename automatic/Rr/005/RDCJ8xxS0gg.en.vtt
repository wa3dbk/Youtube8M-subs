 more 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.589
 Hello my name is Vettel 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.119
 I am product manager at EM and depth the rights of other light shows you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 Today the new clay bacteria in the Thomas series are new technologies 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.109
 play 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.200
 were more favorable manufacturing operation and above all 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.420
 the reduction to the essential 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.700
 There are currently two devices from this series but many will still be available 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.900
 Consequences we are now seeing an innovator 11 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.250
 to the other Wind River 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.900
 in the fifties sixties 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.490
 Torsten Franke should 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.870
 SID Halley off 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.180
 also holds for eternity 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 and sounds 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.400
 see seers official 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.390
 I start with the top which is as the name suggests one eye is enough 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.220
 So we can use the means of German 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.750
 who cares about money 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.120
 but bring that warm one 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.300
 Laps on it and touchingly remembers the performances of the retreat 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.710
 we have in the e-mail complains humorous output running force everything you can 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 You do not need more than that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.679
 Hair s 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 here 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 MR 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.299
 OK 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.540
 the offer will be all again for Dr 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 that offer two 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.470
 with this case, its times are once Habich 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.250
 the heating spiral the break 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.230
 and once a modern hall 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.700
 Braum from the small room small stage is so big hall is all there 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030
 first was the mistake 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.899
 the King like this 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 was Harare 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.909
 more 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.289
 Set Merkel's course 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.289
 to forever store 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.839
 around with these rules here 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.159
 I do not influence that on myself 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.409
 between the direct digital plans 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.989
 completely dry 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 and has a lot 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.229
 and everything in between 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.279
 such to the switch on modern 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.469
 I have the Kea for a short and for a short one 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.279
 something 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.749
 narrow 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 small basement room came on small stage 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.889
 and if I continue to enlighten 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.260
 then the sound becomes ever more powerful and wider and wider and longer 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.920
 WS 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 such a big cathedral 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.409
 that would be nice 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.369
 as the sound does not just sound evenly, but 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.349
 These are slight variations in it just as you would in natural space 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.339
 even higher than the sound comes the go again some way comes back again 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.019
 it would be children, of course 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.109
 okay those are the first two legally from the Tom Wax series many consequences yet 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.849
 if that liked should also www Kate - 6 - because already their points 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:46.889
 given 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.239
 there are even more videos to all the other places means 11 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.469
 or YouTube MySpace I hope you liked it 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.590
 Alcoa has
