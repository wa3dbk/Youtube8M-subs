battle on Geonosis and Luminara Unduli
healed<00:04:47.479> him<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.900> since<00:04:48.409> that<00:04:48.500> he<00:04:48.770> had<00:04:48.919> a<00:04:48.949> high

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
healed him and since that he had a high

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.089 
healed him and since that he had a high
medical<00:04:49.490> Orion<00:04:50.000> count<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.710> decided<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.740> train

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
medical Orion count and decided to train

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.330 
medical Orion count and decided to train
him<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.569> Jedi<00:04:53.569> which<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.770> kind<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.129> awkward

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
him as Jedi which is kind of awkward

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.969 
him as Jedi which is kind of awkward
because<00:04:55.870> Jango<00:04:56.870> Fett<00:04:57.110> who<00:04:57.349> was<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.560> original

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
because Jango Fett who was the original

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.640 
because Jango Fett who was the original
clone<00:04:58.310> didn't<00:04:59.270> have<00:04:59.449> any<00:04:59.719> medical<00:05:00.050> Orion<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:00.620> I

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
clone didn't have any medical Orion so I

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.399 
clone didn't have any medical Orion so I
don't<00:05:00.919> see<00:05:01.099> how<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.280> regular<00:05:01.879> clone<00:05:02.150> did<00:05:02.539> you

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
don't see how a regular clone did you

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.580 
don't see how a regular clone did you
know<00:05:03.729> thing<00:05:04.729> but<00:05:05.000> it's<00:05:05.659> obviously<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.169> made-up
