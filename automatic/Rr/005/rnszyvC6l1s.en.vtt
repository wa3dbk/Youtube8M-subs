00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
possible transfer to a s Monaco we could

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.460 
possible transfer to a s Monaco we could
end<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> career<00:01:12.750> mode<00:01:12.869> into<00:01:13.080> an<00:01:13.229> AS<00:01:13.439> Monaco

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.840 
because I feel like playing this career
by<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.030> should<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.320> quicker

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
by they should be going up quicker

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
by they should be going up quicker
however<00:01:38.850> doing<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.020> obviously<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.890> didn't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
however doing so obviously I didn't

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
however doing so obviously I didn't
realize<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.299> clears<00:01:42.899> their

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
realize this it actually clears their

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.249 
realize this it actually clears their
arm<00:01:44.100> stats<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> season<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:48.259> was

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
arm stats for the season so do I I was

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.480 
arm stats for the season so do I I was
kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> unknowing<00:01:50.009> whether<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> do

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
kind of unknowing whether or not to do

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
kind of unknowing whether or not to do
that<00:01:50.610> because<00:01:50.790> obviously<00:01:51.030> they<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that because obviously they can go up in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920 
that because obviously they can go up in
higher<00:01:52.500> potential<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.299> we<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.450> lose<00:01:54.659> their

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
higher potential or we can lose their

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
higher potential or we can lose their
stats<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:55.950> won't<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> top

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
stats so one of them won't be the top

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
stats so one of them won't be the top
goalscorer<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.960> league<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
goalscorer of the league so if you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.139 
goalscorer of the league so if you
picked<00:01:59.369> not<00:02:00.030> James<00:02:00.329> Wilson<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:00.960> um<00:02:02.149> well

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
picked not James Wilson or um well

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.830 
picked not James Wilson or um well
Wilson<00:02:03.899> James<00:02:04.649> Wilson<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.399> Ennis<00:02:05.969> una<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
Wilson James Wilson or Ennis una you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.330 
Wilson James Wilson or Ennis una you
were<00:02:06.930> correct<00:02:07.170> cuz<00:02:07.560> none<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
were correct cuz none of them can be the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
were correct cuz none of them can be the
top<00:02:08.489> goal<00:02:08.670> scorer<00:02:08.989> technically<00:02:09.989> because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
top goal scorer technically because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.780 
top goal scorer technically because
obviously<00:02:10.470> their<00:02:10.800> stats<00:02:11.099> got<00:02:11.310> wiped<00:02:11.550> when<00:02:11.730> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
obviously their stats got wiped when I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760 
obviously their stats got wiped when I
loaned<00:02:12.270> them<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.629> record<00:02:13.050> them
