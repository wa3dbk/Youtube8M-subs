00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
caster used to be we use a fairly long

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.610 
caster used to be we use a fairly long
wooden<00:00:46.220> screw<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:47.000> want<00:00:47.210> enough<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.750> the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
wooden screw you want enough of the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.770 
wooden screw you want enough of the
screw<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.040> get<00:00:49.190> into<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.910> wood<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.420> piano

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
screw to get into the wood of the piano

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.260 
screw to get into the wood of the piano
to<00:00:51.079> make<00:00:51.260> sure<00:00:51.470> that<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.920> caster<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.820> secure

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
to make sure that the caster is secure

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.580 
to make sure that the caster is secure
and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.510 

we<00:00:56.920> just<00:00:57.219> installed<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.910> with<00:00:58.440> pre-drilled

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we just installed that with pre-drilled

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.780 
we just installed that with pre-drilled
holes

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.230 

like<00:01:08.390> this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.580 

and<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> course<00:01:12.840> we'll<00:01:13.050> put<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.440> other

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and of course we'll put in the other

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.649 
and of course we'll put in the other
three<00:01:13.920> screws

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.340 

and<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.340> find<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.999> an<00:01:20.149> excellent<00:01:20.600> caster

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
and this we find is an excellent caster

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.830 
and this we find is an excellent caster
for<00:01:21.710> hardwood<00:01:22.340> floors<00:01:22.810> or<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:24.170> carpet<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
for hardwood floors or for carpet the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.230 
for hardwood floors or for carpet the
the<00:01:28.509> issue<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:30.020> sometimes<00:01:30.350> arises<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.579> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
the issue that sometimes arises is that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.550 
the issue that sometimes arises is that
the<00:01:32.780> caster<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:34.329> made<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:35.600> such<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.899> manner<00:01:36.259> that

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
the caster is made in such a manner that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.910 
the caster is made in such a manner that
there's<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.829> slight<00:01:37.130> Ridge<00:01:37.990> along<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.469> center

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
there's a slight Ridge along the center

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.529 
there's a slight Ridge along the center
seam<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.819> the<00:01:41.240> caster<00:01:42.099> so<00:01:43.099> what<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.299> is

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
seam of the caster so what we do is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.779 
seam of the caster so what we do is
before<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.079> mount<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.829> casters<00:01:46.310> onto<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
before we mount the casters onto the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.319 
before we mount the casters onto the
piano<00:01:47.439> we<00:01:48.439> run<00:01:49.009> this<00:01:49.189> over<00:01:49.429> a<00:01:49.670> belt<00:01:50.000> sander

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
piano we run this over a belt sander

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.729 
piano we run this over a belt sander
just<00:01:50.959> very<00:01:51.319> lightly<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:52.069> take<00:01:52.340> off<00:01:52.579> that<00:01:52.879> Ridge

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:53.739 
just very lightly to take off that Ridge

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.569 
just very lightly to take off that Ridge
because<00:01:54.739> even<00:01:55.099> a<00:01:55.219> slight<00:01:55.579> Ridge<00:01:56.200> will<00:01:57.579> create

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
because even a slight Ridge will create

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.029 
because even a slight Ridge will create
a<00:01:58.729> dent<00:01:59.629> on<00:01:59.899> a<00:02:00.590> hardwood<00:02:01.250> floor<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:01.969> some<00:02:02.270> cases

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
a dent on a hardwood floor in some cases

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.469 
a dent on a hardwood floor in some cases
so<00:02:04.039> by<00:02:04.250> doing<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.819> we're<00:02:05.030> trying<00:02:05.329> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
so by doing that we're trying to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.990 
so by doing that we're trying to
minimize<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:09.310> chances<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.670> happening

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
minimize the chances of that happening

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.369 
minimize the chances of that happening
so<00:02:12.099> as<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.430> see<00:02:13.489> it's<00:02:13.940> fully<00:02:14.209> Swift<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.200> it

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
so as you can see it's fully Swift if it

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.339 
so as you can see it's fully Swift if it
can<00:02:15.590> swivel<00:02:15.829> easily<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:17.599> makes<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.109> easy

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
can swivel easily this makes for easy

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.879 
can swivel easily this makes for easy
maneuvering<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.090> piano

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
maneuvering of the the piano

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.530 
maneuvering of the the piano
however<00:02:21.889> when<00:02:22.489> mounting<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.150> heavy<00:02:23.420> object

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
however when mounting a heavy object

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.800 
however when mounting a heavy object
like<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> piano<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.769> hardwood<00:02:25.340> floor<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:26.480> still

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
like a piano on hardwood floor we still

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
like a piano on hardwood floor we still
recommend<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.739> type<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.000> coaster<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:30.400> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
recommend a type of a coaster that the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.780 
recommend a type of a coaster that the
piano<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.450> placed<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:33.139> a<00:02:33.470> hardwood<00:02:34.160> coaster

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
piano is placed on a hardwood coaster

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.050 
piano is placed on a hardwood coaster
that<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.260> manufacture<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.669> to<00:02:37.669> further

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
that we also manufacture as to further

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.730 
that we also manufacture as to further
protect<00:02:38.419> the<00:02:39.079> floor
