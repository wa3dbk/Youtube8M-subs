longboarding they've been designing this
board<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.210> two<00:00:12.360> years<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.440> see

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
board for two years now as you can see

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.670 
board for two years now as you can see
it's<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.790> slight<00:00:15.210> concave<00:00:16.020> slight

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
camber bamboo and hemp and what's really

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.510 
camber bamboo and hemp and what's really
good<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.340> really

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
good about that is that it's really

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
good about that is that it's really
eco-friendly<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
eco-friendly as well as it's very very

poppy<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:24.180> carving<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.960> would

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
poppy as you're carving on this I would

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
poppy as you're carving on this I would
say<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.529> deck<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.830> reminds<00:00:26.369> me<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.580> lot

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
say this is a deck that reminds me a lot

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.929 
say this is a deck that reminds me a lot
of<00:00:26.880> dervish<00:00:27.869> flex<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.220> far<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> stiff

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of dervish flex one as far as the stiff

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
of dervish flex one as far as the stiff
goes<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.689> 200<00:00:31.140> pounds<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> gives

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
goes I've about 200 pounds and it gives

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
goes I've about 200 pounds and it gives
me<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> lot<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.309> return<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.300> like

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
me a lot of return and I really like

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
me a lot of return and I really like
that<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:34.170> far<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.410> carving<00:00:34.860> around<00:00:35.130> goes<00:00:35.370> very

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that as far as carving around goes very

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
that as far as carving around goes very
powerful<00:00:36.300> carving<00:00:36.690> deck<00:00:36.870> these<00:00:37.410> holes<00:00:37.770> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
powerful carving deck these holes don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040 
powerful carving deck these holes don't
really<00:00:38.730> affect<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.120> ride<00:00:39.329> too<00:00:39.629> much<00:00:39.809> other

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
really affect the ride too much other

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
really affect the ride too much other
than<00:00:40.170> lightning<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.950> weight<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> actual

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
than lightning the weight of the actual

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.970 
than lightning the weight of the actual
board<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.469> nice<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
board up I think they're really nice it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
board up I think they're really nice it
makes<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> easier<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> grab<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.059> board<00:00:45.300> next

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
makes it easier to grab the board next

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.889 
makes it easier to grab the board next
thing<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> tip<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.180> tail<00:00:48.539> this

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thing is that in the tip and tail this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.819 
thing is that in the tip and tail this
board<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> notice<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
board you're going to notice that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
board you're going to notice that
they've<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.250> three<00:00:51.090> different<00:00:51.570> mounting

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they've got three different mounting

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
they've got three different mounting
options<00:00:52.680> /<00:00:52.980> tip<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> /<00:00:53.760> tail<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> what's<00:00:54.809> nice

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
options / tip and / tail and what's nice

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
options / tip and / tail and what's nice
about<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.800> lets<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.219> kind<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
about that is it really lets you kind of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.160 
about that is it really lets you kind of
very<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.719> running<00:00:57.930> as

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
very what you're going to be running as

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
very what you're going to be running as
far<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> wheelbase<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
far as a wheelbase right now I have it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.750 
far as a wheelbase right now I have it
set<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> medium<00:01:01.829> whale<00:01:02.010> wheelbase

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
set up with the medium whale wheelbase

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.570 
set up with the medium whale wheelbase
both<00:01:03.000> front<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:04.040> allowing<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> board

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
both front and back allowing the board

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
both front and back allowing the board
to<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.869> functioning

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to have a little bit of a functioning

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
to have a little bit of a functioning
nose<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.830> tail<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.400> pop<00:01:08.580> shuvit<00:01:08.850> switch<00:01:09.119> I'm

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
nose and tail for pop shuvit switch I'm

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
nose and tail for pop shuvit switch I'm
no<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.159> gives<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
no good at as well as it gives it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550 
no good at as well as it gives it
maximum<00:01:11.970> wheel<00:01:12.180> clearance<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.290> allows<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
maximum wheel clearance and it allows it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.440 
maximum wheel clearance and it allows it
to<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.340> bit<00:01:14.520> softer<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> wanted

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
to be a little bit softer if you wanted

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
to be a little bit softer if you wanted
the<00:01:15.479> board<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> feel<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.290> softer<00:01:16.710> as

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the board to feel a little bit softer as

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
the board to feel a little bit softer as
well<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.520> could<00:01:17.700> scoot<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> wheelbase<00:01:18.479> out

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
well you could scoot the wheelbase out

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
well you could scoot the wheelbase out
again<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.320> definitely<00:01:19.530> soften<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> up

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
again that would definitely soften it up

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
again that would definitely soften it up
if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> wanted<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> feel<00:01:21.090> stiffer<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.990> could

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
if you wanted to feel stiffer you could

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109 
if you wanted to feel stiffer you could
narrow<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> wheelbase<00:01:22.920> great<00:01:23.369> deck<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> was

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
narrow the wheelbase great deck if I was

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
narrow the wheelbase great deck if I was
to<00:01:24.270> compare<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.780> anything<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.530> say

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to compare it with anything I would say

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
to compare it with anything I would say
as<00:01:25.979> far<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.250> quality<00:01:26.490> goes<00:01:26.939> definitely<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.810> par

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
of camber and I'm a pretty pretty much a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
of camber and I'm a pretty pretty much a
downhill<00:02:08.160> guy<00:02:08.550> um<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.690> nice<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> hop

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.220 
downhill guy um it's really nice to hop
on<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> deck<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:11.489> camber<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
on a deck with some camber in it

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.509 
on a deck with some camber in it
every<00:02:12.349> once<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> while<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.220> helps

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
every once in a while it really helps

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.490 
every once in a while it really helps
you<00:02:13.640> learn<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:14.030> carve<00:02:14.300> again<00:02:14.599> which<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.409> of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you learn to carve again which is one of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.660 
you learn to carve again which is one of
those<00:02:15.560> things<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:16.040> think<00:02:16.129> is<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.489> kind<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
those things I think is just kind of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.080 
those things I think is just kind of
underrated<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.959> yeah<00:02:18.730> definitely<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.819> good

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
underrated but yeah definitely a good

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.699 
underrated but yeah definitely a good
deck<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.840> carve<00:02:21.080> around<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
deck to go and carve around on and

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.649 
deck to go and carve around on and
really<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> blast<00:02:22.519> if<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.000> need<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
really have a blast if you need to you

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.240 
really have a blast if you need to you
know<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.959> down<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> big<00:02:24.379> hill<00:02:24.409> this<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> board

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
know go down a big hill this is a board

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.289 
know go down a big hill this is a board
that<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.400> could<00:02:25.580> definitely<00:02:25.700> carve<00:02:26.120> this

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
that you could definitely carve this

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.449 
that you could definitely carve this
feet<00:02:26.510> away<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:26.870> even<00:02:27.500> stand<00:02:27.799> up<00:02:27.980> slide<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.250> was

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
feet away and even stand up slide I was

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.580 
feet away and even stand up slide I was
noticing<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.599> amount<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.900> concave

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
noticing that with the amount of concave

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.289 
noticing that with the amount of concave
that<00:02:31.129> it<00:02:31.220> does<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.430> combined<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.209> that

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
that it does have combined with that

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.699 
that it does have combined with that
little<00:02:32.510> bit<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.780> flex<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.379> allows<00:02:33.530> you

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
little bit of flex it really allows you

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.470 
little bit of flex it really allows you
to<00:02:33.769> snap<00:02:34.129> those<00:02:34.400> stamps<00:02:34.700> slides<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.209> there

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
to snap those stamps slides out there

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.930 
to snap those stamps slides out there
