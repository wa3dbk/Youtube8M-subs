00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.320 
up shortly you know and over the weeks
that<00:04:55.190> will<00:04:55.370> keep<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.610> guys<00:04:55.729> posted<00:04:55.790> an<00:04:56.240> update

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that will keep you guys posted an update

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.080 
that will keep you guys posted an update
on<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.960> with<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.650> hot<00:04:57.919> glue<00:04:57.950> I<00:04:58.400> think<00:04:58.940> that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
on it with the hot glue I think that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.650 
on it with the hot glue I think that
seals<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.540> web<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.050> i<00:05:00.290> guess<00:05:00.740> no<00:05:00.979> shading<00:05:01.660> none

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
seals the web so i guess no shading none

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.230 
seals the web so i guess no shading none
which<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.560> amazing<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.190> also<00:05:04.580> very<00:05:04.820> minimal

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
which is amazing and also very minimal

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.540 
which is amazing and also very minimal
tinkling<00:05:05.930> like<00:05:06.440> I'll<00:05:06.650> get<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.860> snag<00:05:07.130> every<00:05:07.430> now

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
tinkling like I'll get a snag every now

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.940 
tinkling like I'll get a snag every now
and<00:05:07.669> again<00:05:07.729> but<00:05:08.240> it's<00:05:09.200> because<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.680> closure

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
and again but it's because the closure

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.679 
and again but it's because the closure
is<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.250> little<00:05:10.580> bit<00:05:10.669> earlier<00:05:10.789> than<00:05:11.330> the

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 
is a little bit earlier than the

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.589 
is a little bit earlier than the
actual<00:05:12.110> web<00:05:12.679> star<00:05:12.949> but<00:05:13.759> they<00:05:13.999> still<00:05:14.269> blend

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
actual web star but they still blend

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.359 
actual web star but they still blend
perfectly<00:05:14.899> so<00:05:15.499> I<00:05:15.529> don't<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:15.979> an<00:05:16.069> issue<00:05:16.159> with

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:16.369 
perfectly so I don't have an issue with

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:18.070 
perfectly so I don't have an issue with
that<00:05:16.519> like<00:05:16.849> I<00:05:16.939> said<00:05:17.149> in<00:05:17.299> the<00:05:17.330> first<00:05:17.479> video<00:05:17.659> and

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
that like I said in the first video and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.259 
that like I said in the first video and
even<00:05:18.799> though<00:05:18.919> this<00:05:19.129> is<00:05:19.309> a<00:05:19.429> loose<00:05:19.669> curly<00:05:19.999> hair

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:20.269 
even though this is a loose curly hair

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.649 
even though this is a loose curly hair
or<00:05:20.449> a<00:05:20.979> loose<00:05:21.979> wavy<00:05:22.219> hair<00:05:22.459> it<00:05:22.759> still<00:05:23.209> can<00:05:23.449> get

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
or a loose wavy hair it still can get

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.779 
or a loose wavy hair it still can get
big<00:05:24.110> if<00:05:24.469> you<00:05:24.649> let<00:05:24.769> it<00:05:24.799> get<00:05:25.009> dry<00:05:25.069> and<00:05:25.279> you<00:05:25.610> just
