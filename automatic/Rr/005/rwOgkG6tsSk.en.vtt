routine in the morning I use the crest

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.420 
routine in the morning I use the crest
3d<00:01:01.750> white<00:01:01.960> toothpaste<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.829> as<00:01:02.979> you<00:01:03.100> can<00:01:03.250> see

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
3d white toothpaste and as you can see

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.619 
3d white toothpaste and as you can see
I'm<00:01:03.549> running<00:01:03.729> out<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.239> but<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.540> really

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
I'm running out of it but it's really

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.120 
I'm running out of it but it's really
good<00:01:04.930> toothpaste<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.649> I<00:01:05.710> think<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:05.979> does<00:01:06.100> a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
good toothpaste and I think it does a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.560 
good toothpaste and I think it does a
really<00:01:06.310> good<00:01:06.490> job<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.729> giving<00:01:07.030> your<00:01:07.360> teeth

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
really good job of giving your teeth

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.779 
really good job of giving your teeth
that<00:01:07.780> extra<00:01:08.170> little<00:01:08.320> bit<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.530> whiteness<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.159> I

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
that extra little bit of whiteness and I

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:10.980 
that extra little bit of whiteness and I
can<00:01:09.940> always<00:01:10.060> use<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.509> because<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.930> don't

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
can always use that because I don't

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.930 
can always use that because I don't
really<00:01:11.409> use<00:01:11.680> white<00:01:11.920> strips<00:01:12.220> all<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.490> often<00:01:12.820> I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
really use white strips all that often I

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.609 
really use white strips all that often I
don't<00:01:13.030> actually<00:01:13.299> like<00:01:13.630> do<00:01:13.780> any<00:01:13.990> whitening

the downbar my teeth are really

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.059 
the downbar my teeth are really
sensitive<00:01:19.869> so<00:01:20.229> that's<00:01:20.380> kind<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.679> why<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.830> don't

I<00:01:27.250> recently<00:01:27.429> switched<00:01:27.850> my<00:01:28.119> skincare<00:01:28.420> routine

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
I recently switched my skincare routine

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.169 
I recently switched my skincare routine
to<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.500> like<00:01:29.800> just<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.310> few<00:01:30.340> very<00:01:31.030> limited

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
to be like just a few very limited

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.029 
to be like just a few very limited
products<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.229> one<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.530> them<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.979> I

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
products and this is one of them and I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.290 
products and this is one of them and I
think<00:01:33.069> it's<00:01:33.399> doing<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.670> really<00:01:33.850> great<00:01:34.000> job<00:01:34.090> of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
think it's doing a really great job of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.139 
think it's doing a really great job of
limiting<00:01:35.200> my<00:01:35.440> breakouts<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.789> really

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
limiting my breakouts and it's really

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.609 
limiting my breakouts and it's really
good<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:37.960> wash<00:01:38.110> my<00:01:38.259> face<00:01:38.409> with

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
good and so I just wash my face with

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.219 
good and so I just wash my face with
that<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.039> really<00:01:39.280> like<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.580> foaming<00:01:40.229> mists

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229

my new year's resolutions this year is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
my new year's resolutions this year is
to<00:02:26.110> wash<00:02:26.319> my<00:02:26.530> pillowcase<00:02:26.980> at<00:02:27.160> least<00:02:27.340> once<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
to wash my pillowcase at least once a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.730 
to wash my pillowcase at least once a
week<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:27.880> because<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.510> know<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.319> have

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
week just because I know that I have

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.160 
week just because I know that I have
like<00:02:30.280> active<00:02:30.700> breakouts<00:02:31.150> obviously<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.990> my

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
like active breakouts obviously on my

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.449 
like active breakouts obviously on my
skin<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.010> washing<00:02:33.370> my

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
skin and I think that washing my

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.800 
skin and I think that washing my
pillowcase<00:02:33.880> will<00:02:34.090> help<00:02:34.270> prevent<00:02:34.630> those

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
pillowcase will help prevent those

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.330 
pillowcase will help prevent those
because<00:02:35.200> your<00:02:35.590> face<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.800> on<00:02:36.040> your<00:02:36.190> pillow

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
because your face is on your pillow

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.920 
because your face is on your pillow
every<00:02:36.670> single<00:02:36.940> night<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.720> probably

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
every single night and it can probably

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.900 
every single night and it can probably
be<00:02:38.080> causing<00:02:38.530> some<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> breakouts<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.340> I'm

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
be causing some of the breakouts so I'm

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.940 
be causing some of the breakouts so I'm
gonna<00:02:40.060> try<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.510> wash<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.080> all<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.440> time<00:02:41.650> but

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
my face when I do that so basically I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.980 
my face when I do that so basically I
just<00:05:23.770> get<00:05:24.130> out<00:05:24.250> of<00:05:24.280> my<00:05:24.400> pajamas<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:25.090> usually<00:05:25.960> I

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
just get out of my pajamas and usually I

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.840 
just get out of my pajamas and usually I
keep<00:05:26.230> my<00:05:26.320> pajama<00:05:26.650> pants<00:05:26.980> on<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.550> today<00:05:27.760> I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
keep my pajama pants on but today I

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.670 
keep my pajama pants on but today I
decided<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.360> just<00:05:28.660> put<00:05:29.020> on<00:05:29.140> leggings<00:05:29.500> and

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
decided to just put on leggings and

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.080 
decided to just put on leggings and
everything<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.130> look<00:05:30.250> somewhat<00:05:30.700> decent

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
everything and look somewhat decent

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.120 
everything and look somewhat decent
because<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:32.050> only<00:05:32.290> do<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.590> top<00:05:32.740> half<00:05:32.770> in

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
because you only do the top half in

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.470 
because you only do the top half in
videos<00:05:33.430> anyway<00:05:33.700> so<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.940> doesn't<00:05:34.000> even<00:05:34.240> matter

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
videos anyway so it doesn't even matter

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.570 
videos anyway so it doesn't even matter
then<00:05:35.260> I<00:05:35.350> just<00:05:35.530> go<00:05:35.680> ahead<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.040> apply<00:05:36.250> my<00:05:36.280> makeup

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
then I just go ahead and apply my makeup

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.280 
then I just go ahead and apply my makeup
because<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.060> usually<00:05:37.330> end<00:05:37.690> up<00:05:37.780> filming<00:05:37.990> quite<00:05:38.260> a
