use the stock android browser it uses a
HTC's<00:00:30.449> browser<00:00:30.830> which<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.099> my<00:00:32.250> opinion<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
HTC's browser which in my opinion is

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.590 
HTC's browser which in my opinion is
inferior<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.649> stock<00:00:35.640> browser<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.239> let<00:00:36.540> me

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
inferior to the stock browser so let me

inferior to the stock browser so let me

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that it's going to jump around because

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.130 
that it's going to jump around because
it<00:01:55.350> tries<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> layout<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.180> just
