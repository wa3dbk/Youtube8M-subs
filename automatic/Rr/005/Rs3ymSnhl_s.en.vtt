00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.289
 very good to all guys here we are 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.390
 in minecraft this is a snack shot of 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.810
 the last ones that there are and in which I am going 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.920
 to teach how to tame a horse 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.660
 like this here 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.660
 and what we are going to need is 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.120
 good what's it called 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 the saddle this is optional the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 Armor for the horse is optional 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.129
 we do not need the only thing we need 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.070
 to tame it are these two things the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.400
 wheat 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.440
 it can be wheat can be apples the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.739
 myth is to give it away from the golden apples 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 it is a camel can be taken with wheat 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.920
 which is much cheaper can be taken 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.540
 with normal apples and well first thing 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 what we are going to do is look for a horse 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.170
 wild that if I remember correctly in this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.170
 map there was one around here 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.280
 this is the map where where I have done 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 my times 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.020
 and here were horses 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.680
 and now I'm going to look bad 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.840
 seriously there were horses there were three or 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.620
 four where do you think there were three or 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.170
 four 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.960
 OK 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.220
 if we try to get up now he gets up 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.220
 it does not let us climb 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 therefore we have to 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.409
 bribe him a bit 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.950
 so you can let us climb 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 we give a few 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 and still does not leave 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.530
 We return to try not to leave after you 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.210
 we give more 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.280
 and it does not leave 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.280
 This is going to be difficult 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.530
 leave it 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.790
 now now we have to put up 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.790
 that hearts have come out 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.580
 and now we can put this and with 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.440
 we already control what happens 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.260
 we have mounted it on top of the water 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.800
 and that happens to us above water 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.800
 disassemble 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.660
 and we already have a horse and then if we want 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.660
 we can put the armor and other 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:53.090
 we already have the horse tamed 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.540
 is that the one since you already know guys to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.469
 tame horses and me 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.819
 until then remember to subscribe and 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.480
 the rest 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.480
 see you later
