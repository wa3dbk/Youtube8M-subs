 while the richest 10% make up half of all incomes on

 found these social disparities in advertising with the richest

 Western campaigns for luxury goods 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.430
 we often see white Europeans but also in the back who 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.729
 even some products 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 we must not hide the face before its term 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.559
 in my opinion that it was necessary to tighten 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.319
 the end of the busy in the pub in France thirty thirty years ago woman in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.009

 almost all in the service of the main illegal fishing sector and hse 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.019
 food me I understand it worked 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.449
 they have percent food brands 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.449
 that make up the bulk of investments 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.369
 but recently a new highly competitive sector is also very 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.970
 popular energize the telecom market 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.669
 we have seen the arrival of orange a shattering on the market 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.409
 followed behind number 2 it's beautiful 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.430
 actually chosen the stock market she walks they came up with means 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430
 we did not know before it worked 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.429
 attention the success of the mobile phone 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.429
 the advertising agencies finally have been able to show their know-how 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.479
 result between the big Western companies diffused on the bouquets 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.939
 satellites from the first real local creations the 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.089
 Senegalese will begin to develop their own common culture 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.099
 one of the teenagers 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.999
 we gather at the past advertising is something that does not like each other and 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.639
 they are apathetic to this 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.269
 the devices and there often speaks to what they are offered one of the most beautiful 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.279
 personal qualities 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.049
 in the reverse in case of victory m recent weeks many 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.500
 times it's the free fight 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.450
 but this bet is initialized to 20 euros because of the incidents in a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.509
 neighborhood be even more creative 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.349
 but the main constraint here is budgets that go from 2000 to 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.969
 twenty thousand euros for a film which imposes to be simple and basic 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.979
 the first place went to the pool 16:55 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.610
 this according to the commissioner 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.629
 it is probably for the advertisers and the feeling of having them for their 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.180
 money the Senegalese pub often resort to this subterfuge the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.930
 infomercial 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.620
 it is something that is not the case 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.999
 mystery 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.379
 but that he is still 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.599
 and that is a reportage combination this class 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.229
 Moreover, it occurs just after 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.800
 behind the defense face this finding however very badly three four five 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.620
 minutes it's even stronger at the point of sale 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.050
 right now my comment both producers why we 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.130
 leaves a lot of hope for many 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.319
 the choice the publisher 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.409
 another question 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.689
 in a Muslim country more than 90% 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.740
 how far can advertising go in women's representation by 

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:11.229
 example 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.749
 the mid-season 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.710
 in front of this situation 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.349
 simmer % 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:24.080
 we are a woman or a man to the press keeping the jersey but this 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.419
 which really interests not a good reason not to offend his friends 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.369
 bosses of albatrosses here we will not be able to messi religion 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:33.099
 imposes some that ad 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.469
 the latter does not hesitate to mix secular and sacred in a way 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.469
 which would be qualified of real netbook with us 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.800
 - for the longest 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.629

 One thing is sure the caravan of the Tour de France
