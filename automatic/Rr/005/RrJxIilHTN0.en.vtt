French manicure is better for those with

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.580 
French manicure is better for those with
longer<00:03:38.790> nails<00:03:38.970> because<00:03:39.480> um<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.410> more

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
longer nails because um you have more

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440 
longer nails because um you have more
room<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:41.100> paint<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.549> whereas<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.299> have

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
room to paint it whereas if you have

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.270 
room to paint it whereas if you have
really<00:03:42.720> short<00:03:42.900> nails<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.410> when<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.680> did<00:03:43.980> went
