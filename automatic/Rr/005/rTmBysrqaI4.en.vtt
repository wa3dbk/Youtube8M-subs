controller in people's hands because

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.689 
controller in people's hands because
making<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.559> game<00:00:57.559> about<00:00:57.739> weightlessness<00:00:58.369> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
making a game about weightlessness and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.399 
making a game about weightlessness and
moving<00:00:59.030> around<00:00:59.180> weightlessness<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.900> really

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
moving around weightlessness is really

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.509 
moving around weightlessness is really
difficult<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:02.600> really<00:01:03.589> feel<00:01:03.769> like<00:01:03.830> we<00:01:04.010> we

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
difficult and we really feel like we we

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.880 
difficult and we really feel like we we
nailed<00:01:04.729> how<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.119> feels<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:05.740> doesn't<00:01:06.740> matter

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
nailed how it feels but doesn't matter

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.429 
nailed how it feels but doesn't matter
if<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.330> way<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.689> has<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:08.930> be<00:01:09.049> how

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
if we think that way it has to be how

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.069 
if we think that way it has to be how
gamers<00:01:09.740> feel<00:01:10.250> about<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.789> people<00:01:11.719> seem<00:01:12.049> to

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
gamers feel about it and people seem to

gamers feel about it and people seem to
be<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:12.439> really<00:01:12.710> digging<00:01:13.039> it<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.280> that's

cool yeah I have I have played the demo
I've<00:01:16.280> seen<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.850> looks<00:01:17.060> absolutely<00:01:17.899> amazing

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320

and one of the things I like the most is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.789 
and one of the things I like the most is
is<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.270> setting<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.840> would<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.740> a

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
is the setting and you would think on a

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.169 
is the setting and you would think on a
space<00:01:22.130> station<00:01:22.159> right<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.850> going<00:01:22.969> to<00:01:23.030> be

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
space station right it's going to be

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.669 
space station right it's going to be
it's<00:01:23.479> going<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.689> be<00:01:23.749> plain<00:01:24.020> white<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.530> grey

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
it's going to be plain white and grey

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.919 
it's going to be plain white and grey
but<00:01:24.859> it's<00:01:25.009> not<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.609> we've<00:01:25.850> got<00:01:26.060> these<00:01:26.600> huge

putting you know making it making a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.239 
putting you know making it making a
space<00:01:37.429> station<00:01:37.640> basically<00:01:38.270> well<00:01:39.249> there's

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
space station basically well there's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:43.959 
space station basically well there's
there's<00:01:41.619> fictional<00:01:42.619> reasons<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.429> aesthetic

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
there's fictional reasons and aesthetic

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.580 
there's fictional reasons and aesthetic
reasons<00:01:44.179> for<00:01:44.719> those<00:01:45.490> fictional<00:01:46.490> reasons<00:01:47.090> are

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
reasons for those fictional reasons are

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
reasons for those fictional reasons are
in<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.740> game<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.549> space<00:01:50.210> station<00:01:50.539> exists

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
in the game the the space station exists

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.059 
in the game the the space station exists
because<00:01:52.119> in<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:54.170> future<00:01:54.439> earth<00:01:54.649> is<00:01:54.859> failing

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
because in the future earth is failing

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.499 
because in the future earth is failing
so<00:01:55.429> they're<00:01:55.549> trying<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.789> colonize<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.329> moon

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
so they're trying to colonize the moon

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.389 
so they're trying to colonize the moon
and<00:01:57.020> they're<00:01:57.409> taking<00:01:57.679> these<00:01:57.770> plants<00:01:58.159> up<00:01:58.310> to

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
and they're taking these plants up to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.879 
and they're taking these plants up to
space<00:01:58.639> and<00:01:58.909> they've<00:01:59.329> found<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.749> way<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.649> grow

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
space and they've found a way to grow

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.279 
space and they've found a way to grow
plants<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.549> extract<00:02:02.179> oxygen<00:02:02.389> and<00:02:02.959> then<00:02:03.109> use

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
plants and extract oxygen and then use

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.139 
plants and extract oxygen and then use
it<00:02:03.439> on<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.619> move<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.920> then<00:02:04.549> aesthetically

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
it on the move and then aesthetically

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.360

green you know ferns and stuff like that

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.910 
green you know ferns and stuff like that
it's<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:39.020> adds<00:02:39.170> something<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> game

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's just it adds something to the game

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.820 
it's just it adds something to the game
and<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.970> aesthetic<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:42.500> think<00:02:42.710> it's

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and to the aesthetic that we think it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.180 
and to the aesthetic that we think it's
beautiful<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.340> cool<00:02:43.810> awesome<00:02:44.810> yes<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.650> one

beautiful and cool awesome yes and one
other<00:02:46.220> thing<00:02:46.430> about<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.940> aesthetic<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.510> think

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
other thing about the aesthetic I think

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.380 
other thing about the aesthetic I think
is<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.560> sound<00:02:48.830> really<00:02:49.220> right<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.910> you're

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
is is the sound really right so you're

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.030 
is is the sound really right so you're
in<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.570> suit<00:02:50.840> that's<00:02:51.050> really<00:02:51.320> badly<00:02:51.470> damaged

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
in this suit that's really badly damaged

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.790 
in this suit that's really badly damaged
and<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.280> can<00:02:52.430> sort<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.180> hear<00:02:53.530> vibrations<00:02:54.530> and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
and you can sort of hear vibrations and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.070 
and you can sort of hear vibrations and
then<00:02:55.130> there's<00:02:55.520> audio<00:02:55.790> logs<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.600> things<00:02:56.960> like

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
then there's audio logs and things like

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.900 
then there's audio logs and things like
that<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.410> come<00:02:57.650> through<00:02:57.680> your<00:02:57.980> suit<00:02:58.310> you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
that that come through your suit you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.190 
that that come through your suit you
talk<00:02:59.090> about<00:02:59.470> you<00:03:00.470> know<00:03:00.580> why<00:03:01.810> some<00:03:02.810> things<00:03:02.840> are

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
talk about you know why some things are

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.420 
talk about you know why some things are
hearing<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.710> challenges<00:03:04.310> in

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
hearing like that in the challenges in

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.980 
hearing like that in the challenges in
terms<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:04.910> developing<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.690> sort<00:03:05.900> of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
terms of like developing that sort of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.400 
terms of like developing that sort of
sound<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.890> first<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.280> all<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.460> decided<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:08.410> we

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
sound so first of all we decided that we

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860 
sound so first of all we decided that we
really<00:03:09.440> wanted<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.100> immerse<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.670> player<00:03:10.870> via

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
really wanted to immerse the player via

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.080 
really wanted to immerse the player via
audio<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:13.220> whole<00:03:13.370> game<00:03:13.610> takes<00:03:13.970> place

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
audio so the whole game takes place

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.620 
audio so the whole game takes place
inside<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:15.050> helmet<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.300> helmet

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
inside a helmet right and the helmet

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.740 
inside a helmet right and the helmet
allows<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> hear<00:03:18.790> everything<00:03:19.790> right<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
allows you to hear everything right you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.660 
allows you to hear everything right you
