is one side to side three sides that are
all<00:02:16.320> long<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.790> there's<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.030> short

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
all long then here there's a short

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.520 
all long then here there's a short
stubby<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> think<00:02:18.960> that's<00:02:19.260> how<00:02:19.350> it's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
stubby one so I think that's how it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590 
stubby one so I think that's how it's
supposed<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:19.950> made<00:02:20.130> also<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> don't<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.450> if

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
supposed to be made also I don't know if

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.930 
supposed to be made also I don't know if

trademark stuff it's annoying but it's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.870 
trademark stuff it's annoying but it's
necessary<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.750> understand<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:47.190> down<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
necessary I understand that so down the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.320 
necessary I understand that so down the
shaft<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.480> very<00:02:49.370> very<00:02:50.370> straight<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
shaft it's very very straight as you can

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.540 
shaft it's very very straight as you can
see<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.530> square<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.070> end<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.460> then

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
see kind of square at the end and then

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.810 
see kind of square at the end and then
it<00:02:53.670> gets<00:02:53.760> circling<00:02:54.330> around<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.720> spinny<00:02:55.080> part

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
it gets circling around this spinny part

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
it gets circling around this spinny part
with<00:02:56.820> all<00:02:56.850> these<00:02:57.090> circles<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.980> dot<00:02:59.660> comes<00:03:00.660> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
with all these circles and dot comes to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.300 
with all these circles and dot comes to
the<00:03:00.930> end<00:03:01.970> right<00:03:02.970> here<00:03:03.380> very<00:03:04.380> nice<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.890> it's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310
