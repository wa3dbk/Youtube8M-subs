make filters for saltwater fish tanks
now<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.370> good<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:18.970> about<00:02:19.060> four<00:02:19.420> hundred

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
now this is good for about four hundred

gallon fish tank on itself but i use for

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.390 
gallon fish tank on itself but i use for
bacteria<00:02:23.140> filter<00:02:23.590> because<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.220> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
bacteria filter because you have to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.949 
bacteria filter because you have to
build<00:02:24.549> back<00:02:24.850> here<00:02:25.120> you're<00:02:25.299> up<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.630> your<00:02:25.720> tank

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
build back here you're up and your tank

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.420 
build back here you're up and your tank
to<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> successful<00:02:26.530> tank

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
to have a successful tank

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
to have a successful tank
and<00:02:27.819> then<00:02:27.939> if<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> look<00:02:28.329> down<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.590> have

and then if you look down here we have
what<00:02:29.980> they<00:02:30.099> call<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> wet<00:02:30.790> dry<00:02:31.030> filter<00:02:31.359> this

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
what they call is a wet dry filter this

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.959 
what they call is a wet dry filter this
is<00:02:32.469> a<00:02:32.500> weapon<00:02:32.769> it's<00:02:33.099> called<00:02:33.370> Anna<00:02:33.549> miracle

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
is a weapon it's called Anna miracle

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.569 
is a weapon it's called Anna miracle
which<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.390> felt<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.870> has<00:02:35.019> bible<00:02:35.319> balls<00:02:35.739> under

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
which I felt it has bible balls under

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.179 
which I felt it has bible balls under
here<00:02:36.790> which<00:02:36.969> also<00:02:37.209> collects<00:02:37.780> bacteria<00:02:38.469> that's

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
here which also collects bacteria that's

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.580 
here which also collects bacteria that's
the<00:02:39.400> whole<00:02:39.549> thing<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.969> really<00:02:40.170> goes<00:02:41.170> here<00:02:41.469> and

the whole thing it really goes here and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.860 
the whole thing it really goes here and
this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.890> an<00:02:42.010> ultraviolet<00:02:42.790> light<00:02:42.969> this<00:02:43.510> kills

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
this is an ultraviolet light this kills

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.610 
this is an ultraviolet light this kills
any<00:02:44.349> free<00:02:44.769> like<00:02:45.629> parasites<00:02:46.629> in<00:02:47.109> the<00:02:47.170> fish<00:02:47.590> tank

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
any free like parasites in the fish tank

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.360 
any free like parasites in the fish tank
and<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.909> is<00:02:49.120> also<00:02:49.439> this<00:02:50.439> also<00:02:50.620> filters<00:02:51.189> it

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
and this is also this also filters it

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.800 
and this is also this also filters it
has<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> bunch<00:02:51.849> of<00:02:52.000> layers<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:52.629> different

has a bunch of layers of all different
kind<00:02:53.109> of<00:02:53.200> filtration<00:02:53.620> systems<00:02:54.189> and<00:02:54.609> this<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.359> a

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
kind of filtration systems and this is a

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.390 
kind of filtration systems and this is a
protein<00:02:55.930> skimmer<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.439> protein<00:02:56.799> skimmer<00:02:57.099> acts

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
protein skimmer the protein skimmer acts

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.059 
protein skimmer the protein skimmer acts
like<00:02:57.639> waves<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.329> on<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.599> beach<00:02:58.810> what<00:02:59.680> happens

like waves do on the beach what happens

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.190 
like waves do on the beach what happens
is<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.430> forms<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.180> lot<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.480> bubbles<00:03:01.659> and<00:03:02.079> any

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
is it forms a lot of bubbles and any

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.349 
is it forms a lot of bubbles and any
kind<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.680> garbage<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.639> comes<00:03:03.819> out<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
kind of garbage that comes out of the

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.789 
kind of garbage that comes out of the
tank<00:03:04.599> goes<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.139> end<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.409> goes<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:05.769> down

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
tank goes in the end it goes right down

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.339 
tank goes in the end it goes right down
