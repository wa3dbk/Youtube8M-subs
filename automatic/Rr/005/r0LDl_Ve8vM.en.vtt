00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you know one of those cool just put it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
you know one of those cool just put it
in<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.320> close<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.710> lid<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.400> way

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
in there and close up the lid this way

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.260 
in there and close up the lid this way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
bunch girl that's a song lyric of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.840 
bunch girl that's a song lyric of
something<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.570> google<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.850> but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
something I know it just google it but

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
something I know it just google it but
also<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.110> simple<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.650> just

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
also it could be as simple as just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.060 
also it could be as simple as just
putting<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.840> garbage<00:01:21.840> bag<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> speak<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
putting in a garbage bag so to speak and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
putting in a garbage bag so to speak and
plastic<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> side<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
plastic it up put it on the side you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.090 
plastic it up put it on the side you
basically<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> take<00:01:26.040> some

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
basically you just want to take some

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.999 
basically you just want to take some
precautions<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.650> fermentation

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
precautions then when the fermentation

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.179 
precautions then when the fermentation
and<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> co2<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.119> built<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:31.189> refrigerating

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and the co2 is built up by refrigerating

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
and the co2 is built up by refrigerating
your<00:01:32.310> kombucha<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> great<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> store

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
your kombucha it's a great way to store

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.510 
your kombucha it's a great way to store
it<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> refrigerate

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it because when you refrigerate

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
it because when you refrigerate
something<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> yeasts<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.229> slow<00:01:37.619> down

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
something the yeasts will slow down

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.749 
something the yeasts will slow down
