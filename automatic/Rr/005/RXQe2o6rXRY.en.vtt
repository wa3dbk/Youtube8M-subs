00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
parts for a five year old computer to be

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.919 
parts for a five year old computer to be
honest<00:00:13.080> aren't<00:00:13.380> bad<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:14.240> especially<00:00:15.240> since

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

that round and your power supply one

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
that round and your power supply one
terabyte<00:00:59.699> hard<00:00:59.879> drive<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.690> stepping<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
terabyte hard drive so I'm stepping it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
terabyte hard drive so I'm stepping it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
Lattimore up space ah this is one of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.350 
Lattimore up space ah this is one of the
newer<00:01:06.659> handy<00:01:07.020> process<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.680> six<00:01:07.950> cores<00:01:08.360> I'm

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
newer handy process or six cores I'm

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.140 
newer handy process or six cores I'm
running<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.840> four<00:01:10.049> gigs<00:01:10.490> or<00:01:11.490> digga<00:01:11.729> hurts<00:01:11.970> each

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
running at four gigs or digga hurts each

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060 
running at four gigs or digga hurts each
so<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.960> huge<00:01:13.290> upgrade<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> one

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
but of course the brand new motherboard

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.649 
but of course the brand new motherboard
that<00:01:33.720> i<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that i use for this and then this is the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.370 
that i use for this and then this is the
hand<00:01:37.079> image<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.060> ordered<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.990> him<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
hand image what i ordered it for him I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
hand image what i ordered it for him I
didn't<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:40.890> realize<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> full

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
didn't really realize that it was a full

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
didn't really realize that it was a full
case<00:01:42.390> um<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:43.799> read<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> description

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
case um and then read the description

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.899 
case um and then read the description
closely<00:01:44.850> enough<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.329> yeah<00:01:46.140> she's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> big<00:01:46.680> boy

closely enough so yeah she's a big boy

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
closely enough so yeah she's a big boy
honestly<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.299> overkill<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.259> this

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
honestly it's a little overkill but this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.810 
honestly it's a little overkill but this
is<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.520> giving<00:01:50.909> him<00:01:51.090> room<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
is kind of you know giving him room to
