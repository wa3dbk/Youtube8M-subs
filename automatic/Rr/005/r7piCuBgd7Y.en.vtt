already and i made it removable because

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
already and i made it removable because
since<00:00:20.010> they'd<00:00:20.130> sit<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> top<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> motor

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
since they'd sit in the top of the motor

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
since they'd sit in the top of the motor
and<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.720> transmission<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.949> i<00:00:23.070> ever<00:00:23.189> need

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and the transmission and if i ever need

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.340 
and the transmission and if i ever need
to<00:00:23.609> remove<00:00:23.880> something<00:00:24.210> their<00:00:24.539> work<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
to remove something their work and the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.120 
to remove something their work and the
modern-day<00:00:25.980> transmission<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> be

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
modern-day transmission and want to be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
modern-day transmission and want to be
breaking<00:00:29.130> things<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.269> motor<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
breaking things to get the motor or the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
breaking things to get the motor or the
transmission<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.800> i<00:00:31.830> made<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.610> removal

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
transmission out so i made this removal

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.799 
transmission out so i made this removal
so<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.309> fixed<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.489> screws<00:00:36.320> also<00:00:38.809> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so they are fixed with screws also this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
so they are fixed with screws also this
is<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.020> progress<00:00:40.440> I've<00:00:40.710> made<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.100> far<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.550> had

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is the progress I've made so far I had

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
is the progress I've made so far I had
to<00:00:42.180> move<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.540> fuse<00:00:43.110> box<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to move this fuse box it was here in the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
to move this fuse box it was here in the
middle<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> way<00:00:45.000> try<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> move<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
middle of the way try to move it to this

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.580 
middle of the way try to move it to this
place<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:48.090> live<00:00:48.300> room<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> emergency

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
place to live room for the emergency

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.720 
place to live room for the emergency
disconnect<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> working<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.870> fine

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
disconnect and this is working now fine

this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.340> cabin<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this is going to go to the cabin and I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
this is going to go to the cabin and I
should<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.449> able<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.840> disconnect<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> power

should be able to disconnect the power

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
should be able to disconnect the power
from<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.210> case<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.719> emergency<00:01:03.379> also

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
from there in case of an emergency also

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.090 
from there in case of an emergency also
I<00:01:05.390> got<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.530> watering<00:01:07.530> system<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I got a watering system for the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
I got a watering system for the
batteries<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.790> three<00:01:09.000> batteries<00:01:09.380> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
batteries there are three batteries that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.179 
batteries there are three batteries that
are<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.420> under<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> controller<00:01:13.189> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
are going to be under the controller so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
are going to be under the controller so
that's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> problem<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:16.130> watering<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that's a problem for watering them so I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.640 
that's a problem for watering them so I
bought<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:19.799> watering<00:01:20.250> systems

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
bought one of these watering systems

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.039 
bought one of these watering systems
they<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:23.119> replace<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> regular<00:01:24.600> caps<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
they just replace the regular caps on

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.920 
they just replace the regular caps on
the<00:01:25.170> batteries

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
the batteries

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.700 
the batteries
push<00:01:27.930> water<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> systems<00:01:30.260> this<00:01:31.260> this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
push water to the systems this this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
push water to the systems this this
basically<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> three

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
basically is going to be for the three

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.890 
basically is going to be for the three
batteries<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.560> under<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.900> controller

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
batteries that are under the controller

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.219 
batteries that are under the controller
and<00:01:37.290> here's<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.369> failing<00:01:38.850> point<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> just

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and here's my failing point so you just

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
and here's my failing point so you just
keep<00:01:40.409> point<00:01:40.680> pumping<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> each<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> these

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
keep point pumping and each one of these

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.749 
keep point pumping and each one of these
closes<00:01:42.540> automatically<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> battery<00:01:44.729> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
closes automatically when the battery is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.630 
closes automatically when the battery is
full<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.140> keep<00:01:46.380> pumping<00:01:46.830> until<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.430> day

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
full so you keep pumping until all day

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
full so you keep pumping until all day
until<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.509> cannot<00:01:48.780> pump<00:01:48.990> any<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:49.500> me

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
until you cannot pump any more than me

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
until you cannot pump any more than me
there<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> fame<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> system<00:01:52.020> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
there for the fame of this system is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.300 
there for the fame of this system is
that<00:01:52.200> they're<00:01:52.500> expensive<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:54.600> costs<00:01:54.899> about

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
that they're expensive it costs about

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
that they're expensive it costs about
seventy<00:01:56.310> sixty<00:01:57.030> seventy<00:01:57.360> eighty<00:01:57.509> dollars<00:01:58.170> per

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
seventy sixty seventy eighty dollars per

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
seventy sixty seventy eighty dollars per
battery<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.789> is<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.179> expensive<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:00.750> I'm

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
battery which is very expensive so I'm

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.180 
battery which is very expensive so I'm
just<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> use<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.470> system<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
just going to use that system for the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.219 
just going to use that system for the
batteries<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.759> cover<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.899> watches

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
batteries that are cover the watches

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.200 
batteries that are cover the watches
that<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.679> top<00:02:04.860> part<00:02:05.009> should<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.850> easy<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
that on the top part should be easy to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.880 
that on the top part should be easy to
water<00:02:06.899> them<00:02:07.170> manually<00:02:08.750> what<00:02:09.750> else<00:02:09.959> I've<00:02:10.739> been

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
water them manually what else I've been

nice tip for that is if you put your

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.970 
nice tip for that is if you put your
brush<00:04:19.090> get<00:04:20.090> some<00:04:20.270> water<00:04:20.510> once<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.470> are<00:04:21.500> done

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
brush get some water once you are done

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.820 
brush get some water once you are done
with<00:04:22.040> using<00:04:22.460> it<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:23.120> will<00:04:23.270> not<00:04:23.420> get<00:04:23.720> hard<00:04:24.050> you

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
with using it you will not get hard you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.770 
with using it you will not get hard you
just<00:04:24.860> put<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:25.580> water<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.510> when<00:04:26.660> you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
just put in a little water and when you

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.180 
just put in a little water and when you
want<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> paint<00:04:27.260> again<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.770> just<00:04:27.800> shake<00:04:28.160> it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
want to paint again you just shake it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.520 
want to paint again you just shake it
and<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:29.060> can<00:04:29.270> keep<00:04:29.420> painting<00:04:29.660> again<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.320> put

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
and you can keep painting again you put

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.500 
and you can keep painting again you put
it<00:04:30.620> back<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.920> water<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.820> won't<00:04:32.060> get<00:04:32.150> hard

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
it back in the water it won't get hard

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.230 
it back in the water it won't get hard
so<00:04:33.080> you<00:04:33.140> can<00:04:33.350> still<00:04:33.590> use<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.890> same<00:04:34.040> brush<00:04:34.910> if

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
so you can still use the same brush if

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.730 
so you can still use the same brush if
you<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:35.900> me<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.200> you're<00:04:36.350> going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.590> paint

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
you like me and you're going to paint

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.830 
you like me and you're going to paint
like<00:04:36.860> every<00:04:37.310> two<00:04:37.460> or<00:04:37.610> three<00:04:37.640> days<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.690> don't

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
like every two or three days you don't

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.240 
like every two or three days you don't
