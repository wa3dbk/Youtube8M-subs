 it gets worse, with the paralysis of 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.000
 port workers argue that the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.330
 blocking of the inputs to the terminal 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.730
 is generating them as merchants

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.390
 total dead slow 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.700
 the charges are stopped because the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.130

 there are few sales there are no customers 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.150
 Bolivians but what the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.460
 purchases insured but can not 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 take out because the port is closed in 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.600
 this moment they must demand both the 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.910
 city and the zofri that supports all 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.310
 users who are and have you account the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.320
 opinion of the users not only a 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 unilateral law like them what you are 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.210
 but lateral zombie we all want 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 on the other side who are equally 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.290
 are affected by the paralysis of 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.200
 workers of it and are the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.360
 international carriers in this 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.880
 case the truckers of nationality 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.580
 Bolivian women who have their merchandise 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 no commercial movement with this framework 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.460
 that we are unemployed and there is no way out 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.250
 we are not loading 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.100
 and in the horses and problems conclusion 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 of the item and there is no discharge and neither sea 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 street because they are not going the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.040
 containers and so also from the hobby 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.409
 we depend on the envelope too 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.210
 We load to Bolivia and transport 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.009
 us several when you are the driver 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.869
 it's international I know we're in the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.560
 hitting the pair to be solved from 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.890
 once 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.810
 we are very surprised of the way 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.520
 it and is handling the problem that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.739
 has and we can not download the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.100
 trucks that we have loaded loaded for 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.360
 the books for the two ports and t-pain 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.000
 then we are worried because 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.489
 our terms are substantial per day 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.800
 of delay that we have here we are by 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.830
 more than twenty-odd days that's our 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.140
 problem with full support the councilman 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.050
 Mauricio Soria joined this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.239
 manifestation reiterating the same 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.860
 demands to the government in the city of 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.300
 iquique through its mayor and his 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.600
 commercial account that is the most 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.100
 direct from the city with the state not 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.230
 we know the solution for our 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.880
 and has not given us a solution has not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.630
 listened neither to the businessman of 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.630
 practice 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.670
 minutes and the city does not resist anymore 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.530
 wait a year and this is part of what 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.600
 we want answer we want it to be 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 they feel to converse what the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.470
 free zone that they feel at 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.300
 talk to discuss the issues 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.090
 because they have made decisions 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.100
 without really knowing what happens in the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.830
 dialogue region that if it was finalized 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.510
 users of the free zone and president of 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.720
 the federation of port workers 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.970
 and you presented your demands before the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.970
 substitute superintendent gonzalo prieto 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.640
 user 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.050
 12 days 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.150
 what happens what happens why why not 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.250
 solves problems his work because 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.260
 we have back soon we have never been 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.930
 received we have asked for a lot per month 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.209
 is that the entire board of directors is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 meet with us and we have not succeeded 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.310
 we work like 25 years 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:07.030
 system today 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.410
 a month ago we did not receive 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.160
 Meza would say some 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.660
 I was not born from a merchandise because first 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:22.450
 no week to record 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.460
 second two weeks to these and others 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.280
 requests of the substitute mayor 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.820
 responded that the solution deserves time 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.070
 and that will work on it and that takes 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.420
 time does not mean that I have here 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.060
 when you tell yourself but it takes that year 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.400
 In the past, the economy portal intendente 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.850
 who presides over us put together a table 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.800
 work 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.930
 you know the work that you start evaluating 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.390
 if it is not giving the width it will be 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.160
 modify it if people are missing the day of the 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.630
 violence that the workers are not 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.850
 punctual of that table then 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.270
 included because here you can not miss 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.790
 nobody and discuss each topic but 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.630
 resolving I insist on the administrative 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.969
 what can be resolved internally 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.909
 in the legal what can also be 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.369
 the first legal one as a sample of that 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.129
 four days ago light and received his 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:17.819
 first fine for the consequences of 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.819
 the paralysis 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.480
 do not
