I<00:01:37.880> think<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.659> discussion<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:39.440> will<00:01:39.500> have

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
I think that the discussion we will have

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.300 
I think that the discussion we will have
hard<00:01:40.159> if<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:41.300> understood<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.050> that<00:01:42.080> way<00:01:42.409> is<00:01:42.620> what

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
hard if I understood it that way is what

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.690 
hard if I understood it that way is what
is<00:01:43.600> actually<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.810> consumption<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.460> what

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
is actually the consumption so that what

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.410 
is actually the consumption so that what
we<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.270> here<00:01:47.659> are<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.620> discharges<00:01:49.420> that's
