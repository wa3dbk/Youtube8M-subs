00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
pressure at the bottom get it stuck at

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.720 
pressure at the bottom get it stuck at
the<00:04:24.540> bottom<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.050> now<00:04:25.620> what<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.010> do<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.430> peel

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
it back up and then stay at the bottom

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.570 
it back up and then stay at the bottom
just<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:31.020> what<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.220> take<00:04:32.400> my

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
just like that what I do is I take my

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.250 
just like that what I do is I take my
squeegee<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.830> push<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.669> squeegee<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.450> get

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
squeegee and I push the squeegee to get

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.730 
squeegee and I push the squeegee to get
it<00:04:37.380> down<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:39.120> push<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.600> squeegee<00:04:40.110> like

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it down so I just push the squeegee like

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.610 
it down so I just push the squeegee like
that<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:42.390> then<00:04:42.480> what<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.690> does<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.140> pretty

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that and then what it does is it pretty

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.770 
that and then what it does is it pretty
much<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:43.950> gets<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.280> air<00:04:44.430> bubbles<00:04:44.850> out<00:04:45.000> as<00:04:45.360> you

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
much it gets the air bubbles out as you

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.020 
much it gets the air bubbles out as you
do<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.260> look<00:04:47.130> at<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.250> no<00:04:47.669> air<00:04:47.880> bubbles

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
do it and look at that no air bubbles

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
and looks great if there is an air

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.060 
and looks great if there is an air
bubble<00:04:50.640> just<00:04:50.970> lift<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.510> near<00:04:51.690> side<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.860> take

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
bubble just lift the near side and take

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.500 
bubble just lift the near side and take
your<00:04:53.220> squeegee<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.270> don't<00:04:54.419> have

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
your squeegee or if you don't have

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.969 
your squeegee or if you don't have
squeege<00:04:54.780> anything<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.320> your<00:04:55.560> fingernail

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
squeege anything just your fingernail

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.850 
squeege anything just your fingernail
and<00:04:56.130> just<00:04:56.970> try<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.120> push<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.690> side<00:04:57.900> so

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
and just try to push it out the side so

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.740 
and just try to push it out the side so
that's<00:04:59.100> how<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.520> do<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:00.000> don't<00:05:00.270> push<00:05:00.510> too<00:05:00.540> hard

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
that's how I do it don't push too hard

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.750 
that's how I do it don't push too hard
because<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.169> don't<00:05:01.320> want<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.500> scratch

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
because you don't want to scratch
