00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
going in a different direction but that
is<00:01:57.299> definitely<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.200> completely<00:01:58.920> different

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
is definitely not a completely different

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
is definitely not a completely different
game<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.509> our<00:02:00.659> opinion<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
game you know that's just our opinion I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.649 
game you know that's just our opinion I
don't<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.860> how<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> guys<00:02:02.399> feel<00:02:02.969> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
don't know how some of you guys feel but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.469 
don't know how some of you guys feel but
anyway<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.399> use<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.729> eco<00:02:06.000> most<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
anyway so if they use an eco most and I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.940 
anyway so if they use an eco most and I
would<00:02:06.659> assume<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.439> using<00:02:07.469> their

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
would assume they would be using their

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
would assume they would be using their
base<00:02:08.220> engine<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.690> had<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.379> game

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
base engine that they had from this game

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.589 
base engine that they had from this game
here<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
here and you know I think that's the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.140 
here and you know I think that's the
best<00:02:12.780> way

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
best way

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.089 
best way
so<00:02:13.269> if<00:02:13.420> they're<00:02:13.540> gonna<00:02:13.689> do<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:13.980> trying<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so if they're gonna do that trying to

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.860 
so if they're gonna do that trying to
rebuild<00:02:15.430> something<00:02:15.819> from<00:02:16.090> scratch<00:02:16.299> they<00:02:16.720> may

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
rebuild something from scratch they may

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.360 
rebuild something from scratch they may
not<00:02:17.079> have<00:02:17.260> time<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> do<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.250> would

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
not have time to do that and it would

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
not have time to do that and it would
take<00:02:18.549> too<00:02:18.760> long<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.209> get<00:02:19.450> where<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.870> needs<00:02:19.930> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
take too long to get where it needs to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.470 
take too long to get where it needs to
be<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.040> anyway<00:02:21.370> guys<00:02:21.579> that's<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.180> latest
