what the heck is going on guys welcome

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.999 
what the heck is going on guys welcome
to<00:00:02.250> your<00:00:02.370> 59th<00:00:03.000> biology<00:00:03.570> lesson<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.830> is

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
to your 59th biology lesson and this is

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.410 
to your 59th biology lesson and this is
rural<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.460> want<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.790> talk<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.060> guys<00:00:06.150> about<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
rural I want to talk to you guys about a

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.259 
rural I want to talk to you guys about a
dude<00:00:06.629> named<00:00:06.839> Gregor<00:00:08.269> Mendel<00:00:10.940> now<00:00:11.940> Gregor

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
dude named Gregor Mendel now Gregor

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.640 
dude named Gregor Mendel now Gregor
Mendel<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.780> actually<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.440> first

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
Mendel was actually one of the first

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.189 
Mendel was actually one of the first
dudes<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> really<00:00:14.670> understand<00:00:15.360> inheritance

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
dudes to really understand inheritance

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.349 
dudes to really understand inheritance
now<00:00:16.890> he<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.130> actually<00:00:17.279> born<00:00:17.580> way<00:00:17.850> back<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
now he was actually born way back in the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.990 
now he was actually born way back in the
1800s<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.289> back<00:00:19.380> then<00:00:19.949> people<00:00:20.400> believed<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
1800s and back then people believed in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.550 
1800s and back then people believed in
something<00:00:21.359> called<00:00:21.510> blending<00:00:22.170> inheritance

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.620 

now<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.769> blending<00:00:26.369> inheritance<00:00:26.630> basically

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
now what blending inheritance basically

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529 
now what blending inheritance basically
was<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> idea<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.240> had

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
was is it was the idea that if you had

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530 
was is it was the idea that if you had
one<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.529> your<00:00:31.560> mates<00:00:31.890> say<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.669> dad<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:33.210> really

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
one of your mates say the dad was really

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
one of your mates say the dad was really
tall<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> he<00:00:34.710> made<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> mom<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
tall and he made it with the mom that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
tall and he made it with the mom that
was<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.899> short<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
was really short or you know the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
was really short or you know the
girlfriend<00:00:38.280> whatever<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
girlfriend whatever it is then the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.139 
girlfriend whatever it is then the
offspring<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.399> medium<00:00:41.790> height

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
offspring would be of medium height

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
offspring would be of medium height
because<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.110> take<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.469> trait<00:00:43.800> which

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
because they would take a trait which

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.459 
because they would take a trait which
would<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.399> tall<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.940> short<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:46.110> traits

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
would be tall and short in these traits

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
would be tall and short in these traits
was<00:00:46.680> kind<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> blend<00:00:47.910> together<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
was kind what kind of blend together so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
was kind what kind of blend together so
the<00:00:49.110> offspring<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.770> pretty<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the offspring would pretty much be the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.290 
the offspring would pretty much be the
average<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.989> mates<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:53.129> obviously<00:00:54.059> later

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
average of the mates now obviously later

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
average of the mates now obviously later
on<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.320> today<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.219> isn't<00:00:56.430> exactly

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
on we know today that this isn't exactly

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
on we know today that this isn't exactly
the<00:00:57.059> case<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.840> Mendel<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the case but Mendel was actually the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
the case but Mendel was actually the
first<00:00:58.920> person<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> he<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.780> didn't

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
first person you know he really didn't

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
first person you know he really didn't
buy<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> idea<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.160> blending<00:01:02.699> inheritance

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
buy the idea of blending inheritance

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.230 
buy the idea of blending inheritance
when<00:01:03.420> everyone<00:01:03.870> else<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.760> he<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.180> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
when everyone else was so what he did is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
when everyone else was so what he did is
he<00:01:06.630> began<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> study<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.409> organisms<00:01:07.520> inherit

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
he began to study how organisms inherit

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.960 
he began to study how organisms inherit
traits<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:09.390> breeding<00:01:09.810> pea<00:01:10.380> plants<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.549> pea

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
traits by breeding pea plants so pea

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
traits by breeding pea plants so pea
plant<00:01:12.299> looks<00:01:12.659> something<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
plant looks something like this and you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.179 
plant looks something like this and you
know<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.790> has<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> flower<00:01:15.479> let<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.080> draw<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.770> don't

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
know it has a flower let me draw I don't

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
know it has a flower let me draw I don't
know<00:01:17.250> maybe<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:18.479> color<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> nice

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
know maybe what color would be a nice

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
know maybe what color would be a nice
purple<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> pea<00:01:23.040> plant<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.580> flowers<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
purple so pea plant has flowers on it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
purple so pea plant has flowers on it
and<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.290> course<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> pea<00:01:26.280> plant<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and of course it's a pea plant so it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
and of course it's a pea plant so it
also<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.330> peas<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.710> guys<00:01:29.130> already<00:01:29.369> know

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
also has peas and you guys already know

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.289 
also has peas and you guys already know
what<00:01:29.729> peas<00:01:29.939> are<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> eat<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> what

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
what peas are the kind you eat so what

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
what peas are the kind you eat so what
he<00:01:33.479> did<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.930> said<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> he<00:01:34.530> pretty<00:01:35.070> much

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
he did like I said is he pretty much

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
he did like I said is he pretty much
started<00:01:35.640> breeding<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.299> P<00:01:36.540> plans<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.020> he

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
started breeding these P plans so he

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
started breeding these P plans so he
could<00:01:37.320> study<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.860> traits<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.119> offspring

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
could study the traits of the offspring

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.840 
could study the traits of the offspring
so<00:01:40.320> basically<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:41.009> looked<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> many<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so basically he looked at many of the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
so basically he looked at many of the
heritable<00:01:42.360> traits<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.500> were

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
heritable traits in some of them were

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.179 
heritable traits in some of them were
flour<00:01:44.070> color<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.560> lower<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:46.829> other<00:01:46.979> ones

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
flour color and lower some other ones

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
flour color and lower some other ones
the<00:01:47.490> color<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> peas<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> trait<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the color of the peas or a trait the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
the color of the peas or a trait the
plant<00:01:49.770> height<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.799> also<00:01:52.799> plant<00:01:53.399> shape<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
plant height and also plant shape and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
plant height and also plant shape and
pretty<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.509> any<00:01:54.750> traits<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.799> could

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
pretty much any traits that he could

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
pretty much any traits that he could
observe<00:01:56.159> he<00:01:56.850> took<00:01:57.090> note<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> how

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
observe he took note of and this is how

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.649 
observe he took note of and this is how
he<00:01:58.500> began<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.130> study<00:01:59.450> inheritance<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
he began to study inheritance in

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.530 
he began to study inheritance in
genetics<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.799> after<00:02:02.130> several<00:02:02.670> experiments<00:02:03.119> in

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
genetics so after several experiments in

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
genetics so after several experiments in
breeding<00:02:03.930> different<00:02:04.290> variations<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.009> these<00:02:05.189> P

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
breeding different variations of these P

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
breeding different variations of these P
plans<00:02:05.759> he<00:02:06.270> began<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> notice<00:02:06.840> some<00:02:07.140> very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
plans he began to notice some very

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.040 
plans he began to notice some very
interesting<00:02:07.890> patterns<00:02:08.670> forming<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.840> it's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
interesting patterns forming now it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
interesting patterns forming now it's
important<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> note<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> first<00:02:11.250> few

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
important to note that for the first few

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.530 
important to note that for the first few
of<00:02:12.300> Mendel's<00:02:12.660> experiments<00:02:13.230> he

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
of Mendel's experiments he

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.559 
of Mendel's experiments he
we<00:02:13.689> use<00:02:14.670> pure-breeding<00:02:15.670> pea<00:02:16.090> plants<00:02:18.239> now<00:02:19.239> what

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
we use pure-breeding pea plants now what

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.589 
we use pure-breeding pea plants now what
is<00:02:19.689> a<00:02:19.719> pure<00:02:20.230> breeding<00:02:20.829> pea<00:02:21.250> plant<00:02:21.579> well<00:02:22.239> these

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
is a pure breeding pea plant well these

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.509 
is a pure breeding pea plant well these
are<00:02:22.780> plans<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.079> always<00:02:23.500> reproduce<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.189> same

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
are plans to always reproduce the same

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.479 
are plans to always reproduce the same
traits<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.329> their<00:02:25.450> offspring<00:02:26.310> 100%<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
traits in their offspring 100% of the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.640 
traits in their offspring 100% of the
time<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.420> an<00:02:28.719> example<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.379> would<00:02:29.590> be

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
time so an example of this would be

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.009 
time so an example of this would be
maybe<00:02:30.370> he<00:02:30.549> was<00:02:30.670> studying<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.090> tray<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.720> height

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
maybe he was studying the tray of height

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.860 
maybe he was studying the tray of height
and<00:02:32.349> pea<00:02:33.159> plants<00:02:33.549> have<00:02:33.700> two<00:02:34.030> different

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
and pea plants have two different

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.720 
and pea plants have two different
heights<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.260> they<00:02:35.409> can<00:02:35.590> grow<00:02:35.769> tall<00:02:36.099> or<00:02:36.400> short

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
heights that they can grow tall or short

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.050 
heights that they can grow tall or short
well<00:02:37.510> if<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.959> pea<00:02:38.260> plant<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:38.799> bred<00:02:39.159> pure<00:02:39.790> bred

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
well if a pea plant was bred pure bred

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.059 
well if a pea plant was bred pure bred
correctly<00:02:40.629> this<00:02:41.079> would<00:02:41.260> mean<00:02:41.439> that<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.829> all

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
correctly this would mean that at all

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.390 
correctly this would mean that at all
pea<00:02:42.340> plant<00:02:42.639> it<00:02:43.299> would<00:02:43.480> always<00:02:43.799> reproduce<00:02:44.799> tall

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
pea plant it would always reproduce tall

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.729 
pea plant it would always reproduce tall
offspring<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.989> that's<00:02:47.170> basically<00:02:47.560> what

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
offspring so that's basically what

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.740 
offspring so that's basically what
happens<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.250> pure<00:02:48.609> breeding<00:02:48.909> their<00:02:49.510> pea

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
happens in pure breeding their pea

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.629 
happens in pure breeding their pea
plants<00:02:50.109> that<00:02:50.230> always<00:02:50.650> reproduce<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.370> same

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
plants that always reproduce the same

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.039 
plants that always reproduce the same
traits<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.269> their<00:02:52.389> offspring

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
traits in their offspring

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.210 
traits in their offspring
100%<00:02:53.919> of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> time<00:02:54.700> now<00:02:55.629> of<00:02:55.659> course<00:02:56.019> he<00:02:56.799> pure

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
100% of the time now of course he pure

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.759 
100% of the time now of course he pure
bred<00:02:57.459> tall<00:02:57.909> pea<00:02:58.209> plants<00:02:58.629> in<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.870> also<00:02:59.260> pure

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
bred tall pea plants in the also pure

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.039 
bred tall pea plants in the also pure
bred<00:03:00.010> short<00:03:00.459> pea<00:03:00.700> plants<00:03:01.090> which<00:03:01.599> meant<00:03:01.840> that

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
bred short pea plants which meant that

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.140 
bred short pea plants which meant that
whenever<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.799> pure<00:03:03.189> bred<00:03:03.370> short<00:03:03.970> pea

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
whenever you have a pure bred short pea

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.920 
whenever you have a pure bred short pea
plant<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:05.230> always<00:03:05.530> reproduced<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.609> form

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
plant it always reproduced the form

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.379 
plant it always reproduced the form
short<00:03:07.930> offspring<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.489> whenever<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:10.030> talk<00:03:10.090> about

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
short offspring so whenever I talk about

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.539 
short offspring so whenever I talk about
pure<00:03:10.780> breeding<00:03:11.049> that's<00:03:11.620> what<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:11.829> mean<00:03:12.129> pretty

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
pure breeding that's what I mean pretty

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.640 
pure breeding that's what I mean pretty
much<00:03:12.639> plants<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.299> always<00:03:13.810> reproduce<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
much plants that always reproduce the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.309 
much plants that always reproduce the
same<00:03:14.859> traits<00:03:15.189> in<00:03:15.310> their<00:03:15.430> offspring<00:03:16.200> 100%<00:03:17.200> of

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
same traits in their offspring 100% of

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.469 
same traits in their offspring 100% of
the<00:03:17.439> time<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.609> another<00:03:19.030> thing<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.299> I'm

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:19.479 
the time now another thing that I'm

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.509 
the time now another thing that I'm
going<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.659> be<00:03:19.780> talking<00:03:19.930> about<00:03:20.139> is<00:03:20.519> different

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
going to be talking about is different

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.159 
going to be talking about is different
types<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.909> generations<00:03:22.449> have<00:03:22.690> different

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
types of generations have different

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.469 
types of generations have different
conventions<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.889> naming<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:25.030> original

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
conventions of naming the original

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.420 
conventions of naming the original
parents<00:03:26.019> whenever<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.409> breed<00:03:26.650> something<00:03:26.979> are

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
parents whenever you breed something are

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.530 
parents whenever you breed something are
called<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.879> pea<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.750> generation<00:03:29.709> now<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
called the pea one generation now the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.390 
called the pea one generation now the
offspring<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.199> they<00:03:32.379> breed<00:03:32.769> immediately

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
offspring that they breed immediately

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.129 
offspring that they breed immediately
kind<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.760> think<00:03:33.819> of<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.239> their<00:03:34.569> children

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
kind of think of it like their children

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.629 
kind of think of it like their children
is<00:03:35.290> called<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.510> f1<00:03:37.510> generation<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.220> p1

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
is called the f1 generation so the p1

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.969 
is called the f1 generation so the p1
are<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.329> parents<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.049> f1<00:03:41.530> are<00:03:41.769> the

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
are the parents and the f1 are the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.399 
are the parents and the f1 are the
children<00:03:42.430> now<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.269> next<00:03:43.690> generation<00:03:44.199> we'll

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
children now the next generation we'll

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.449 
children now the next generation we'll
just<00:03:44.560> call<00:03:44.709> these<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.099> don't<00:03:45.159> know<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
just call these I don't know the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.750 
just call these I don't know the
grandchildren<00:03:46.000> are<00:03:46.389> f2<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.889> on<00:03:48.069> and<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.430> forth

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
grandchildren are f2 so on and so forth

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.809 
grandchildren are f2 so on and so forth
so<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.359> original<00:03:49.930> parents<00:03:50.409> are<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.769> p1<00:03:51.190> their

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
so the original parents are the p1 their

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.270 
so the original parents are the p1 their
children<00:03:52.569> are<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.049> f1<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.680> their

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
children are the f1 and their

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.550 
children are the f1 and their
grandchildren<00:03:55.120> or<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.449> next<00:03:55.720> generation<00:03:56.260> are

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
grandchildren or the next generation are

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.520 
grandchildren or the next generation are
called<00:03:56.949> the<00:03:57.250> f2<00:03:57.909> generation<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.349> just

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530
