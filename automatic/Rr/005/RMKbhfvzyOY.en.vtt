00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
tactical team I'm a little bit sick so

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.079 
tactical team I'm a little bit sick so
excuse<00:00:04.680> me<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:05.069> sniffling<00:00:05.520> or<00:00:05.730> something

excuse me if I'm sniffling or something
we're<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.140> talk<00:00:07.259> about<00:00:07.379> today<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.919> where

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
we're going to talk about today is where

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.370 
we're going to talk about today is where
is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> chaos<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.090> particular<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.870> market

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
is a chaos and in particular the market

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.160 
is a chaos and in particular the market
is<00:00:10.500> tues<00:00:10.889> each<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:12.090> even<00:00:12.570> more<00:00:12.719> particular

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
is tues each and even more particular

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.419 
is tues each and even more particular
we're<00:00:13.259> not<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> talk<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.860> character

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
we're not going to talk about character

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
we're not going to talk about character
as<00:00:14.610> well<00:00:14.730> characters<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.330> no<00:00:15.450> no<00:00:15.660> magic<00:00:16.109> we're

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
as well characters but no no magic we're

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.080 
as well characters but no no magic we're
just<00:00:16.379> talking<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:16.980> really<00:00:17.460> put<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
just talking about really put it on the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.330 
just talking about really put it on the
fighters<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.810> things<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.340> so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
fighters and things like that so

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
fighters and things like that so
compared<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.570> other<00:00:21.689> things<00:00:22.020> where

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
compared to some other things where

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
compared to some other things where
there<00:00:22.260> could<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> math<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.310> us<00:00:23.570> there

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
there could be a lot of math to us there

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
there could be a lot of math to us there
could<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
could be you know it's not like when you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960 
could be you know it's not like when you
compare<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.779> type<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> West<00:00:29.039> you're<00:00:29.789> trying

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
compare what type of West you're trying

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910 
compare what type of West you're trying
to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.179> taking<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.859> not

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to be taking because you're not

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.209 
to be taking because you're not
comparing<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.489> these<00:00:32.669> stats<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:35.040> main

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
comparing all these stats here the main

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
comparing all these stats here the main
thing<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.820> comparing<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.809> more

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
thing is can be comparing is more

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
thing is can be comparing is more
survivability<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.879> main

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
survivability because it's the main

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
survivability because it's the main
thing<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> markets<00:00:39.809> azines<00:00:40.050> gives<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
thing that the markets azines gives you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.819 
thing that the markets azines gives you
is<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.579> gives<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.210> 6<00:00:43.050> plus<00:00:43.230> word<00:00:43.530> save

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
is that it gives you a 6 plus word save

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
is that it gives you a 6 plus word save
or<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> ward<00:00:45.210> save<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
or if you don't have a ward save it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.830 
or if you don't have a ward save it
improves<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.700> general<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
improves it by one so in general the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.000 
improves it by one so in general the
math<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.320> fairly<00:00:49.829> easy<00:00:51.469> but<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> same<00:00:52.800> time

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
math is fairly easy but at the same time

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
math is fairly easy but at the same time
can<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.579> tricky<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> just

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
can be a little bit tricky to so I just

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.459 
can be a little bit tricky to so I just
wanted<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> go<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.230> quick<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
wanted to go over that really quick just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
wanted to go over that really quick just
to<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.800> sure<00:00:55.860> everybody's<00:00:56.280> clear<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.149> what

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to make sure everybody's clear so what

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.979 
to make sure everybody's clear so what
you're<00:00:58.109> looking<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> one-in-six<00:00:59.160> ward<00:00:59.609> save

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
you're looking at a one-in-six ward save

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.090 
you're looking at a one-in-six ward save
basically<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.890> make

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
basically what you need to know to make

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
basically what you need to know to make
sure<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.579> worth<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> know

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
sure that it's worth it is that you know

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
sure that it's worth it is that you know
that<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.680> saving<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> one

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that that's going to be saving you one

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
that that's going to be saving you one
in<00:01:05.670> six<00:01:05.880> times<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> take<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> costs<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
in six times so if you take the costs of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.050 
in six times so if you take the costs of
that<00:01:08.689> upgrade<00:01:09.689> times<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:10.680> six<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that upgrade times by six if that is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
that upgrade times by six if that is
less<00:01:12.330> than<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> cost<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> character

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
less than what the cost of the character

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
less than what the cost of the character
is<00:01:14.159> before<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> upgrade<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.110> then

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is before you put that upgrade on then

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
is before you put that upgrade on then
you<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.430> worth<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:17.939> sorry<00:01:18.330> after

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you know it's worth it or sorry after

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
you know it's worth it or sorry after
you<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> upgrade<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.250> more

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you put the upgrade on it if it's more

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
you put the upgrade on it if it's more
expensive<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> means<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.320> worth

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
expensive then that means it's not worth

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
expensive then that means it's not worth
it<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.820> stage<00:01:24.150> its<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.780> fairly

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it so at that stage its really fairly

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679 
it so at that stage its really fairly
simple<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.520> spot<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.330> gets<00:01:27.479> more

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
simple the spot where this gets more

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
simple the spot where this gets more
complicated<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.250> part<00:01:29.549> where<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
complicated is that that part where I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
complicated is that that part where I
said<00:01:29.820> where<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> already<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> ward

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
said where if you already have a ward

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
said where if you already have a ward
save<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> improves<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> by<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.180> say

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
save it improves it by one so let's say

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
save it improves it by one so let's say
we're<00:01:34.200> talking<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> para<00:01:34.890> safe<00:01:35.189> normally

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we're talking about a para safe normally

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
we're talking about a para safe normally
you'd<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> 6<00:01:36.119> plus<00:01:36.329> ward<00:01:36.659> save<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.409> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you'd have a 6 plus ward save if you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
you'd have a 6 plus ward save if you
have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> market<00:01:38.340> becomes<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> 5<00:01:38.970> plus<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
have a market becomes a 5 plus in a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.240 
have a market becomes a 5 plus in a
difference<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.740> where<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.130> before

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
difference here is where as before

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.730 
difference here is where as before
you're<00:01:41.610> comparing<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.329> six<00:01:42.600> well<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you're comparing one and six well you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.139 
you're comparing one and six well you
were<00:01:43.890> already<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> six

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
were already going to be one of the six

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.630 
were already going to be one of the six
safe<00:01:45.390> before<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:47.040> improving<00:01:47.340> your

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
safe before so now you're improving your

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.289 
safe before so now you're improving your
your<00:01:47.880> chance<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> buy<00:01:48.420> 15<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> 90s<00:01:50.970> I've<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.210> at

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
your chance to buy 15 so 90s I've got at

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.450 
your chance to buy 15 so 90s I've got at
times<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> marked<00:01:52.229> by<00:01:52.439> five<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.250> that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
times that marked by five and if that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
times that marked by five and if that's
cheaper<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.630> worth<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.680> we

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
cheaper then it's worth it and so if we

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.050 
cheaper then it's worth it and so if we
go<00:01:55.979> ahead<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.909> had<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
go ahead and look you know if you had a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
go ahead and look you know if you had a
character<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.780> gave<00:01:58.020> an<00:01:58.170> item<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
character that you gave an item that so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
character that you gave an item that so
I<00:01:58.710> had<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> 4<00:01:59.159> plus<00:01:59.430> would<00:01:59.640> say<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> begin<00:02:00.210> with

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
I had a 4 plus would say to begin with

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.630 
I had a 4 plus would say to begin with
so<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:01.079> giving<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> mark<00:02:01.979> given<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.369> 3

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so that giving them the mark given a 3

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
so that giving them the mark given a 3
plus<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> sudden<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.860> someone

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
plus well then all a sudden is someone

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
plus well then all a sudden is someone
in<00:02:05.369> 3<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:05.969> long<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.299> times<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in 3 so as long as you just times I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.139 
in 3 so as long as you just times I
think<00:02:06.960> by<00:02:07.049> three<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> mark<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.030> not

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
think by three and with the mark is not

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
think by three and with the mark is not
that<00:02:09.330> expensive<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> character<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:10.860> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
that expensive on the character really I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.900 
that expensive on the character really I
mean<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.700> totally<00:02:11.940> worth<00:02:12.390> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
mean it's totally worth it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.010 
mean it's totally worth it
when<00:02:13.910> you're<00:02:14.000> looking<00:02:14.120> at<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:14.570> some<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
when you're looking at it for some of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.720 
when you're looking at it for some of
just<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.560> some<00:02:15.740> examples<00:02:16.250> look<00:02:16.430> let's<00:02:16.580> say

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
just for some examples look let's say

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.700 
just for some examples look let's say
for<00:02:16.940> Marauders<00:02:17.150> right<00:02:17.720> we're<00:02:18.140> either<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
for Marauders right we're either for a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.250 
for Marauders right we're either for a
lot<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.920> these<00:02:19.040> times<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.460> can<00:02:19.610> give<00:02:19.760> them

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
lot of these times you can give them

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
lot of these times you can give them
light<00:02:21.260> armor<00:02:21.800> or<00:02:22.100> other<00:02:22.370> upgrades<00:02:22.610> well<00:02:23.330> when

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
light armor or other upgrades well when

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.570 
light armor or other upgrades well when
you<00:02:23.540> compare<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.990> cost<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.530> light<00:02:24.740> armor<00:02:25.190> to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
you compare the cost of light armor to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.250 
you compare the cost of light armor to
the<00:02:25.610> market<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.060> zzzz<00:02:26.390> both<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.110> them<00:02:27.200> are

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the market to zzzz both of them are

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.960 
the market to zzzz both of them are
giving<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.740> six<00:02:27.950> plus<00:02:28.220> save<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.730> ones

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
giving you a six plus save just ones

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.170 
giving you a six plus save just ones
armor<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.540> ones<00:02:29.720> ward<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.940> know<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
armor and ones ward and you know the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.540 
armor and ones ward and you know the
armor<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.870> per<00:02:33.110> model<00:02:33.320> basis<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.220> mark

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
armor is on a per model basis the mark

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.480 
armor is on a per model basis the mark
is<00:02:34.670> an<00:02:34.840> opportunity<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.020> sis<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
is an opportunity a sis so one of the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.600 
is an opportunity a sis so one of the
unit<00:02:37.790> gets<00:02:37.910> big<00:02:38.210> enough<00:02:38.240> that<00:02:39.340> ratio<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
unit gets big enough that ratio of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.520 
unit gets big enough that ratio of
points<00:02:41.270> per<00:02:41.510> person<00:02:42.020> will<00:02:42.140> be<00:02:42.260> low<00:02:42.500> enough

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
points per person will be low enough

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.070 
points per person will be low enough
that<00:02:42.800> it's<00:02:43.040> actually<00:02:43.450> more<00:02:44.450> worth<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.990> in

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that it's actually more worth it in

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.710 
that it's actually more worth it in
effect<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.920> great<00:02:46.790> thing<00:02:47.000> about<00:02:47.030> Ward<00:02:47.450> says

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
effect the great thing about Ward says

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.360 
effect the great thing about Ward says
is<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:47.990> there's<00:02:48.350> very<00:02:48.620> little<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> game

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
is that there's very little in the game

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.670 
is that there's very little in the game
that<00:02:49.640> actually<00:02:50.150> negates<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.780> or<00:02:50.930> our<00:02:51.230> forces

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
that actually negates it or our forces

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.620 
that actually negates it or our forces
to<00:02:51.770> re-roll<00:02:52.100> or<00:02:52.370> anything<00:02:52.580> like<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.760> whereas

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
to re-roll or anything like that whereas

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.150 
to re-roll or anything like that whereas
anything<00:02:54.020> with<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> strength<00:02:54.500> higher<00:02:54.680> than<00:02:54.890> 3

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
anything with a strength higher than 3

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.150 
anything with a strength higher than 3
will<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.730> reducing<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.600> armor<00:02:56.900> state<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:57.860> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
will be reducing the armor state so a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.380 
will be reducing the armor state so a
lot<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.520> times<00:02:58.790> you're<00:02:58.910> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.120> say<00:02:59.270> that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
lot of times you're going to say that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.449 
lot of times you're going to say that
geez<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.780> warrants<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.320> vis<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:01.070> great

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
geez that warrants a vis is a great

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.310 
geez that warrants a vis is a great
thing<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.910> why<00:03:02.450> aren't<00:03:02.690> people<00:03:02.810> taking

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
thing to have why aren't people taking

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.220 
thing to have why aren't people taking
this<00:03:03.440> warm<00:03:03.709> safe<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.870> one<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.989> things<00:03:06.020> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
this warm safe and one of the things I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.990 
this warm safe and one of the things I
find<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.770> funny<00:03:06.980> comparison<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
find it's a funny comparison is if you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.699 
find it's a funny comparison is if you
look<00:03:08.120> at<00:03:08.270> Porton<00:03:08.600> ians<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.320> know<00:03:09.440> I'm<00:03:09.530> always

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
look at Porton ians you know I'm always

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.260 
look at Porton ians you know I'm always
told<00:03:10.040> when<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.250> play<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> thin<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.730> all<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.090> get

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
told when I play a thin that all you get

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.140 
told when I play a thin that all you get
that<00:03:11.510> six<00:03:12.110> plus<00:03:12.380> extra<00:03:13.220> Ward's<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.790> bowl<00:03:13.970> that's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that six plus extra Ward's a bowl that's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.240 
that six plus extra Ward's a bowl that's
so<00:03:14.420> cheesy<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.380> lot<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.560> times<00:03:15.800> they<00:03:16.040> look

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
so cheesy but a lot of times they look

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.400 
so cheesy but a lot of times they look
at<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.580> same<00:03:16.850> onwards<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.600> chaos<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.080> go<00:03:18.200> all<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
at the same onwards a chaos to go all a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.289 
at the same onwards a chaos to go all a
six<00:03:18.709> plus<00:03:19.010> were<00:03:19.250> say<00:03:19.519> what's<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.820> use<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.030> that

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
six plus were say what's the use of that

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.880 
six plus were say what's the use of that
so<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:20.900> kind<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.110> funny<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.680> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
so it's kind of funny to see that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.120 
so it's kind of funny to see that
difference<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.799> one<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.010> things

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
difference and but the one of the things

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.710 
difference and but the one of the things
you<00:03:25.220> got<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.370> balance<00:03:25.580> as<00:03:25.850> well<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.269> you

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
you got to balance as well is that you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.330 
you got to balance as well is that you
know<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.260> question<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.830> okay<00:03:27.950> well<00:03:28.250> why

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
know the the question is okay well why

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.470 
know the the question is okay well why
doesn't<00:03:28.519> everybody<00:03:28.760> take<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> markets

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
doesn't everybody take the markets

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.060 
doesn't everybody take the markets
disease<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.870> their<00:03:30.019> their<00:03:30.260> units<00:03:30.560> well

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
disease in their their units well

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.340 
disease in their their units well
sometimes<00:03:31.430> they<00:03:31.880> take<00:03:32.060> other<00:03:32.330> marks<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.200> of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
sometimes they take other marks so of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.810 
sometimes they take other marks so of
course<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.709> can't<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.190> market<00:03:34.549> corn

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
course you can't have the market corn

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.900 
course you can't have the market corn
and<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.090> market<00:03:35.810> does<00:03:36.080> inch<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.549> had

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
and the market does inch and so you had

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.210 
and the market does inch and so you had
to<00:03:38.000> kind<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.209> pick<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.480> choose<00:03:38.980> now<00:03:39.980> there's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
to kind of pick and choose now there's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.440 
to kind of pick and choose now there's
some<00:03:40.310> other<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.670> synergies<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.269> have<00:03:41.360> to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
some other little synergies you have to

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.940 
some other little synergies you have to
look<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.750> past<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.380> one<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.739> things<00:03:42.860> I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
look on past this one of the things I

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.710 
look on past this one of the things I
was<00:03:43.040> talking<00:03:43.370> about<00:03:43.430> was<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.480> Perry

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
was talking about was with the Perry

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.650 
was talking about was with the Perry
safe<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:46.190> you're<00:03:46.340> looking<00:03:46.489> at<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.820> defensive

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
safe so if you're looking at a defensive

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.160 
safe so if you're looking at a defensive
unit<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.140> let's<00:03:48.320> say<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:48.739> have<00:03:49.570> your<00:03:50.570> Marauders

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
unit so let's say we have your Marauders

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.970 
unit so let's say we have your Marauders
to<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.470> shields<00:03:52.040> also<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.760> throw<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.980> mark

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
to have shields also you throw that mark

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.190 
to have shields also you throw that mark
on<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:55.549> have<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.730> 5<00:03:56.030> plus<00:03:56.269> Perry<00:03:56.750> which<00:03:57.049> is

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
on and they have a 5 plus Perry which is

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.350 
on and they have a 5 plus Perry which is
fantastic<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:58.160> combat<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.730> you've<00:03:58.910> kept<00:03:59.180> them

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
fantastic in combat and you've kept them

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.520 
fantastic in combat and you've kept them
fairly<00:03:59.660> cheap<00:04:00.019> at<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.290> same<00:04:00.530> time<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:02.410> part<00:04:03.410> of

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
fairly cheap at the same time so part of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.620 
fairly cheap at the same time so part of
this<00:04:03.650> though<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.130> where<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.910> math<00:04:05.209> gets<00:04:05.450> a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
this though is where the math gets a

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.030 
this though is where the math gets a
little<00:04:05.750> bit<00:04:05.959> harder<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.680> talking<00:04:06.920> about

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
little bit harder so I was talking about

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.640 
little bit harder so I was talking about
before<00:04:07.160> where<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.850> know<00:04:08.120> half<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.570> North<00:04:08.840> one

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
before where you know half the North one

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.720 
before where you know half the North one
in<00:04:09.769> 61<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.549> five<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.540> at<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.780> point<00:04:12.140> that

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
in 61 in five but at this point that

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.790 
in 61 in five but at this point that
bonus<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:14.150> only<00:04:14.450> going<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> be

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
bonus is only going to be

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.610 
bonus is only going to be
during<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.850> combat<00:04:17.360> so<00:04:17.600> with<00:04:18.170> that<00:04:18.290> example

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
during in combat so with that example

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.550 
during in combat so with that example
you<00:04:18.950> have<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.220> 5<00:04:19.580> plus<00:04:19.760> warding<00:04:20.209> combat<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.230> 6

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you have a 5 plus warding combat and a 6

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.490 
you have a 5 plus warding combat and a 6
plus<00:04:21.830> ward<00:04:22.190> from<00:04:22.580> shooting<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:24.470> really

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
plus ward from shooting so it really

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.680 
plus ward from shooting so it really
depends<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.250> what<00:04:25.460> type<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.730> group<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.480> play

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
depends on what type of group you play

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.440 
depends on what type of group you play
in<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.260> meta<00:04:27.470> game<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.980> but<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.060> way

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
in and what the meta game is but the way

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.300 
in and what the meta game is but the way
I<00:04:29.480> usually<00:04:29.780> look<00:04:30.050> at<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.040> 8th

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
I usually look at it is that in 8th

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.310 
I usually look at it is that in 8th
usually<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.150> first<00:04:32.360> two<00:04:32.600> turns<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.110> getting

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
usually the first two turns you getting

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.710 
usually the first two turns you getting
shot<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.190> next<00:04:34.490> two<00:04:34.610> turns<00:04:34.940> you're<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.420> combat

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
shot the next two turns you're in combat

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.350 
shot the next two turns you're in combat
in<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.530> last<00:04:36.770> two<00:04:36.980> turns<00:04:37.280> if<00:04:37.580> you're<00:04:38.180> really

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
in the last two turns if you're really

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.240 
in the last two turns if you're really
just<00:04:38.480> settling<00:04:39.140> things<00:04:39.200> out<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.830> majority<00:04:40.220> of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
just settling things out to majority of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.070 
just settling things out to majority of
time<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> game<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:40.820> already<00:04:41.060> over<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.630> one

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
time the game is already over and one

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.650 
time the game is already over and one
size<00:04:42.320> cleaning<00:04:42.770> up<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.460> really<00:04:43.940> you're

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
size cleaning up so really you're

then you are looking at the more of that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.170 
then you are looking at the more of that
the<00:04:59.720> x<00:04:59.990> five<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.620> be<00:05:00.830> worthwhile<00:05:01.400> whereas<00:05:02.030> if

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.080 
to go to the time six group to see it's
worthwhile<00:05:06.280> another<00:05:07.280> thing<00:05:07.490> we<00:05:07.520> have<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.910> keep

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
worthwhile another thing we have to keep

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.420 
worthwhile another thing we have to keep
this<00:05:08.270> in<00:05:08.420> mind<00:05:08.450> for<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:09.080> magic<00:05:09.980> resistance

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
this in mind for is magic resistance

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.460 
this in mind for is magic resistance
that's<00:05:11.000> another<00:05:11.270> spot<00:05:11.690> where<00:05:11.960> all<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.170> sudden

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
that's another spot where all a sudden

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.530 
that's another spot where all a sudden
if<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:12.770> had<00:05:12.980> this<00:05:13.160> better<00:05:13.400> ward<00:05:13.700> save<00:05:14.000> your

if you had this better ward save your
magic<00:05:14.900> resistance<00:05:15.320> can<00:05:15.530> be<00:05:15.590> quite<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.130> bit

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
magic resistance can be quite a bit

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.910 
magic resistance can be quite a bit
better<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:18.140> you<00:05:18.170> know<00:05:18.410> if<00:05:18.500> you're<00:05:18.620> throwing<00:05:18.770> a

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
better so you know if you're throwing a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.980 
better so you know if you're throwing a
character<00:05:19.460> into<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.360> unit<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.810> has<00:05:20.960> that

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
character into that unit that has that

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.630 
character into that unit that has that
Marquez<00:05:21.530> each<00:05:21.710> all<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.100> sudden<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.430> can<00:05:22.550> be

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
Marquez each all of a sudden you can be

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.450 
Marquez each all of a sudden you can be
getting<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.060> lot<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.720> synergy<00:05:24.380> out<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.770> so

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
getting a lot of synergy out of that so

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.710 
getting a lot of synergy out of that so
you<00:05:25.520> got<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.760> kind<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.940> work<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:26.419> get<00:05:26.570> the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
you got to kind of work it to get the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.470 
you got to kind of work it to get the
most<00:05:27.169> for<00:05:27.440> your<00:05:28.030> points1<00:05:29.030> things<00:05:29.240> yet<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
most for your points1 things yet the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.240 
most for your points1 things yet the
kind<00:05:29.660> of<00:05:29.750> watts<00:05:29.960> per<00:05:30.200> though<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.710> you

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
kind of watts per though is that you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.280 
kind of watts per though is that you
don't<00:05:31.460> want<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.760> get<00:05:31.970> caught<00:05:32.450> wasting<00:05:33.169> your

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
don't want to get caught wasting your

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.380 
don't want to get caught wasting your
points<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.040> as<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.310> said<00:05:34.370> part<00:05:34.910> that<00:05:35.030> synergy

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
points so as I said part that synergy

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.260 
points so as I said part that synergy
was<00:05:35.810> with<00:05:36.050> having<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.950> parry<00:05:37.220> safe<00:05:37.550> however

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
was with having the parry safe however

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.530 
was with having the parry safe however
if<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.990> have<00:05:39.260> frenzy<00:05:39.950> then<00:05:40.669> all<00:05:41.150> of<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.480> sudden

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
if you have frenzy then all of a sudden

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.770 
if you have frenzy then all of a sudden
you<00:05:42.050> lose<00:05:42.590> your<00:05:42.890> parry<00:05:43.160> save<00:05:43.400> all<00:05:43.669> together<00:05:44.180> so

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
you lose your parry save all together so

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.409 
you lose your parry save all together so
if<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.560> were<00:05:45.620> to<00:05:45.680> have<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:46.220> some<00:05:46.730> units<00:05:47.120> let's

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
if you were to have the some units let's

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.960 
if you were to have the some units let's
say<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.840> know<00:05:47.990> chaos<00:05:48.800> warriors<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.730> had

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
say you know chaos warriors that had

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.330 
say you know chaos warriors that had
shields<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:51.080> market<00:05:51.380> dezeen<00:05:51.650> so<00:05:52.070> five

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
shields and the market dezeen so five

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.850 
shields and the market dezeen so five
plus<00:05:52.370> word<00:05:52.880> same<00:05:53.150> at<00:05:54.140> all<00:05:54.230> sudden<00:05:54.620> then<00:05:54.740> you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
plus word same at all sudden then you

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.310 
plus word same at all sudden then you
have<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.730> BSB<00:05:56.570> or<00:05:56.690> something<00:05:57.020> they<00:05:57.110> are<00:05:57.140> giving

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
have a BSB or something they are giving

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.260 
have a BSB or something they are giving
them<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.710> banner<00:05:57.919> of<00:05:58.070> rage<00:05:58.340> which<00:05:58.820> gives<00:05:59.090> them

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
them the banner of rage which gives them

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.180 
them the banner of rage which gives them
frenzy<00:05:59.690> well<00:06:00.110> then<00:06:00.230> they<00:06:00.320> have<00:06:00.530> no<00:06:00.560> Perry<00:06:01.010> at

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
frenzy well then they have no Perry at

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.340 
frenzy well then they have no Perry at
all<00:06:01.340> so<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.300> have<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.720> keep<00:06:02.840> in<00:06:02.990> mind<00:06:03.230> that

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
all so you have to keep in mind that

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.650 
all so you have to keep in mind that
then<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.890> you're<00:06:04.550> looking<00:06:04.730> at<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.300> one<00:06:05.510> and

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
then that you're looking at the one and

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.710 
then that you're looking at the one and
six<00:06:05.930> rather<00:06:06.440> than<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:07.190> one<00:06:07.640> in<00:06:07.760> five<00:06:08.060> ratio

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
six rather than the one in five ratio

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.940 
six rather than the one in five ratio
therefore<00:06:09.110> whether<00:06:09.260> it's<00:06:09.500> going<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.680> be<00:06:09.770> worth

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
therefore whether it's going to be worth

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.740 
therefore whether it's going to be worth
it<00:06:10.100> or<00:06:10.190> not<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.580> a<00:06:10.970> lot<00:06:11.150> of<00:06:11.180> times<00:06:11.419> people<00:06:11.600> will

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
it or not and a lot of times people will

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.390 
it or not and a lot of times people will
say<00:06:12.020> that<00:06:12.169> well<00:06:12.350> okay<00:06:12.650> then<00:06:12.680> that's<00:06:13.010> obviously

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
say that well okay then that's obviously

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.310 
say that well okay then that's obviously
a<00:06:13.490> stupid<00:06:13.820> combination<00:06:14.390> if<00:06:14.540> i<00:06:14.930> ever<00:06:15.050> saw

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
a stupid combination if i ever saw

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.620 
a stupid combination if i ever saw
somebody<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:16.220> had<00:06:16.430> that<00:06:16.700> shield<00:06:17.090> mock

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
somebody that had that shield mock

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.720 
somebody that had that shield mock
disease<00:06:17.990> in<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.470> banner<00:06:18.680> of<00:06:18.830> rage<00:06:19.070> they're

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730

units and you have offensive units but

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.580 
units and you have offensive units but

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
middle ground so if you have these units

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.990
