00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.330
 Hello everyone, I did not expect so much 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.980
 hype on the review navigator especially 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.500
 when they write in the comments what it costs 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.360
 almost a year half bicycle i also 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.920
 there was a poll on VKontakte 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.240
 call representative since 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.890
 for some reason there were few voices 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.020
 however we are still interesting so what 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.790
 Forward on the link so here is the survey 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.590
 showed that there are not many subscribers 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.360
 uses at least basic 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.220
 sensors to collect data on 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.809
 device like garmin such 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.699
 inconsistency is not peculiar to numbers 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.920
 which shows the board computer they 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.060
 stand in black and white on the market there is already 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.600
 edge 810 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.790
 and 1002 too strong big and heavy 810 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.739
 800 replaced both of them 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.930
 to high-end class gps devices for 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.730
 bike and has tracking features 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.040
 Behind the point of walking on gps 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.350
 this is how data is measured 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.910
 average speed used 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.950
 calories distance covered 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.080
 You can also download travel data to 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.410
 computers load them in for example with 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.060
 grass training pix race is built 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.490
 barometer shows how high you are 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.050
 climbed or not climbed supports 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 wireless standard 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.000
 ant plus carmen collects indicators 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.150
 sensor types of pulse sensor for meters 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.909
 when the sensor is the main difference from more 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.640
 budget models 500 510 card availability 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.860
 i.e. navigation is very practical 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.040
 if you have time to explore new places 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.290
 if partners have a navigator then you 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.280
 You can take the version without navigator 500 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 510 major difference 810 models from 800 and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.840
 This is the presence of the first all sorts of priblud 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.150
 layers of sync with iphone or 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.549
 android actually the same functions 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.990
 only you do not need to connect carmen with 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.750
 computer to sync 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.640
 transfer new cards what else can 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.799
 tell my companions corps 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.530
 waterproof ipx7 standard 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.479
 light rain fell on well, too, a couple 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.070
 time nothing happened just in case 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.280
 stuck homemade film on the screen 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.140
 not to color too 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.390
 fits bike color composition 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.739
 and carbon frame is no longer suitable 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.130
 where is the carbon focus 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.329
 Well, these are things for feng shui lovers 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
 the screen there are two mods with day and night 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.850
 although the nights have not yet traveled 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.010
 and that night mode does not attract light 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.080
 bats although so unexpected 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.270
 case I have a saddle with a huge 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.890
 cut in the middle more practical 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.600
 information gormly supports a lot 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.340
 card formats are easiest to download at 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.320
 either compile yourself in the base program 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.480
 camp navigation accompanied 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.220
 audiovisual type signals soon 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.460
 turn turn now and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.810
 why the hell is so slow to forgive 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.700
 Navigator can record up to 5 profiles 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.860
 bicycles each with individual 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630
 sensors it is convenient with a wide choice 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 two wheels can also be installed 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.520
 individual sleep heartbeat and strength 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.990
 breads such a navigator or takeaway 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.580
 not the best option I will say 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.410
 because the head needs to be even stronger 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.480
 bend down if you want to read something with 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.580
 screen is better to use special 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.920
 takeaway on the fracture was built brul 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.810
 carboxylic sat however much less 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.240
 theatrical and most importantly without 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.150
 rezinochek his era of dynamic position is 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.160
 moget bar fly version double like 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.490
 nothing special piece of plastic for 20 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.250
 Euro 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.140
 weighs 21 grams a good course however 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.300
 many make mistakes here for example 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.790
 almost the same from shame does not have 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.950
 dynamic profile it stands as though 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.660
 Above the helm plane fly fly bar 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.210
 life guarantee on their products 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.930
 something similar is much harder to eat and 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.960
 from harmin 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.760
 and it costs almost forty thanks for 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.740
 voting activity for this video 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
 I really appreciate it even my style check 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.080
 Navigator squeezed a tear and as always 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.080
 dota
