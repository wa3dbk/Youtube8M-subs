needle tie a knot at the end and then

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.530 
needle tie a knot at the end and then

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
you can just put your needle through the
dots<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.439> made<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
dots that you had made now if you have a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
dots that you had made now if you have a
heavier<00:01:15.270> leather<00:01:15.750> fabric<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
heavier leather fabric than this and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.060

your needle doesn't go through easily

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
your needle doesn't go through easily
then<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:21.080> suggest<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:23.479> make<00:01:24.479> holes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
then I suggest that you can make holes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
then I suggest that you can make holes
in<00:01:25.229> advance<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.729> icepick<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.490> that's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
in advance with an icepick and that's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
in advance with an icepick and that's
why<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> suggested<00:01:30.390> having<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> piece<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> wood

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
why I suggested having a piece of wood

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
why I suggested having a piece of wood
so<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.890> damage<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.340> table<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so you don't damage your table so you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.240 
so you don't damage your table so you
can<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.200> put<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.710> ice<00:01:35.310> pick<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can just put the ice pick in on the the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
can just put the ice pick in on the the
marks<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.060> made<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:40.530> your

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
holes done in advance and then that will

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.149 
holes done in advance and then that will
make<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.409> easier<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.909> sew

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you can use to push it through that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100 
you can use to push it through that
makes<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.530> lot<00:01:58.649> easier<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.810> also<00:02:00.810> I
