 Hello, folks, it's not too long since we 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.240
 we made a video a xperia s is the car 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.080
 head of the 2012 smartphone line of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 sony 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.170
 now it is the turn of the middle brother of this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.179
 family it's the cheapest smartphone 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 with fps with a bit configuration 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.599
 more modest but still with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.480
 very interesting resources 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 including the processor there occurs nfc 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.439
 an 8-megapixel camera and a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.439
 beautiful screen is the xperia p 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 the xperia pt design is practically the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.270
 even elegant ex-ps with the sides 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 to bring slightly curved and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.969
 aluminum housing that passes a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 solidity sensation 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.660
 the non - removable battery and no entry 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 for micro sd cards 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.140
 the device uses micro-sim cards in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 serve sweets lot on the left side 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 you can remove a cover just below 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 the screen but there is nothing underneath apart 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.460
 of serial numbers and seals of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.710
 anatel certification 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.109
 inside the ex pp has a processor 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 dual core is a new ericsson tower of 1 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.579
 gigahertz accompanied by 1 gb of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 and 16 GB of flash memory from the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.510
 Rear camera has 8 megapixels and flash 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 and also a front camera for video 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 calls up to 10 pp has 4 inches 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.939
 resolution of 540 by 960 pixels is the same 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 the screen resolution of devices such as 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.020
 Laugh but with a difference she uses 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 sony medical uait technology for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 produce much brighter images 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.170
 one results in better readability over 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 the sun for you to have an idea to too 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 ex bbb is almost twice as bright 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.259
 that lg optimus black screen that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.270
 was the former champion in this category the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 edp 's operating system is android 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.220
 2.3 constant modifications made by 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.930
 sony company has already promised an upgrade 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 score of 4 registration of what 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 should happen by the end of this year 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 the 8 megapixel camera of xperia p 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.430
 records videos in full HD and under the light of 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 Day makes great photos. 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 although night shots may suffer 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 completed as ex pds being a camera 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.450
 from sony 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.060
 it is packed with features including 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 smile detection panoramic photos and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 photos in 3d 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 in fact we have encountered a problem 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 with her on a daily basis she has a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 tendency to saturate things very much 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 intense as you can see this image 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.800
 example at the top with our test of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.200
 performance 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.880
 the sucks fish reached the mark of 5 thousand 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.940
 and 300 points more or less the same 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380
 result of the light casemate s2 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.750
 which is not surprising since the two 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.850
 have the same processor in the day to day we 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.680
 we had no problem running video on 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.570
 high definition or even the most 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.400
 sophisticated asphalt 7 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.710
 already in the battery autonomy the spirit and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 dismounted we got 14 hours in the 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.700
 day to day with light use another day with 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 the most intense use and lemon arrived at 11 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.260
 hours video playback with 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.390
 the screen brightness to 50% and the unit in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.220
 plane mode we got only four 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 hours and 20 minutes and the production of video 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.490
 a low result that seeks a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.200
 sophisticated android smartphone but not 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.280
 want to spend a lot of time play xperia is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.190
 a good option 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.360
 with suggested price of 1,399 reais he is 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 more expensive than appliances of the same 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.410
 category like samsung galaxy s2 light 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.150
 but in compensation has a screen with 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.030
 Higher resolution a better camera 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.070
 NFC more internal memory and an output 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.760
 hdmi which in our opinion compensates the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.840
 difference 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.940
 we would not want the battery 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.340
 for a little while longer that's it folks 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.780
 If you do not have any questions about sp 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.550
 stirring here in the comments of the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.989
 video, do not forget to watch 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.910

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.460
 heating up 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.980
 He went to see what's happening. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.300
 Not only does it have a river guy there in 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:54.940
 down as one is being undertaken 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:54.940
