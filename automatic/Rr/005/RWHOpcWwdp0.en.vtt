00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.019
 priorities 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.469
 besides in the mainstream 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.730
 you know what if a man said with 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 he is also Russian by 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.270
 your new entertainment 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.270
 camera for this region 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.329
 there are still people in the industry who 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.189
 don't give a damn for anybody there 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.560
 principles and rules 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.540
 I do not cite right now as an example like that with 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.050
 his answer to the regions answer antanta under 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.030
 offline title miami 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.740
 However, this fact does not change the speech 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.360
 today will go to the board man 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.020
 more degree responsible for 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.490
 moldova than anyone 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.290
 the phenomenon of the rule is that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.570
 can make a game so even in tetris 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.010
 and appear memorable 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 characters plot atmosphere and intrigue 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.670
 remember at least changed the alarm 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.940
 if you take into account only the gameplay 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.320
 arcade and acado 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.340
 not too extraordinary but not 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.990
 too extraordinary 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.409
 however, it was worth starting to play as it turned out 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.159
 what is the ball of which we are trying to build 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 any living case 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.810
 that is, such as a painter 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.350
 statement and another thousand and one details of the game 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 of the world 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 however the party got worth 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 next chamois situation is almost one in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.270
 one is the same 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 for if I now formulate us 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 gameplay concept for this 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 little miracle then surely many of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 you will decide that yahoo has been flooded with considerations 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.140
 such a high score 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 maybe there is enough 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.550
 number of people who are thinking about 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.340
 tom so that grandfather could have seen such a thing 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.510
 and indeed existence played 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.990
 kimi this confirmation 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.270
 Well, now a couple of words for those who do not know 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.770
 what is alchemy 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.200
 I suspect that such a majority 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 so the player has a peculiar stone 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.680
 who can stack anything 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.520
 set on fire and watch her hit 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 there is a directory from which you can 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.719
 order what you can later 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.469
 put in a stone of 6 the piano is hidden in that 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.580
 after burning, any object leaves 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.400
 money the amount of which is usually 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.739
 initially exceeds its price 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.080
 the goal is to open all 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.340
 directories for opening a new directory 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.269
 goods need to achieve two goals with one 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.090
 parties need to collect money for 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.099
 his purchases 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.650
 and on the other hand you need to earn 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.939
 definitely the number of medals 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.519
 Simply put why and give for simultaneous 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.159
 burning certain 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.579
 combination of objects ultimately gimpu 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.450
 or the crowd it comes down to what 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.719
 player gazing at 10 medals trying 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:39.900
 solve such a combination 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.219
 fixed in the title of that or 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.599
 otherwise obvious 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.499
 no one certainly did not cancel harsh 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.439
 tested in all situations method 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.520
 random sampling 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.670
 however, in that case, by 3 4 hours 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.159
 all 10 12 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.469
 many elgi return stood at the origins 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.889
 massively recognized india if so 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.239
 simple and perishing a different concept is not found in 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.790
 his hands are gorgeous realizations hope about 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.889
 the fact that the process of burning combustion 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.399
 looks gorgeous 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.289
 once again you should not remind 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.159
 because in court and residents process 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.719
 probably not once or twice already been me 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.859
 used 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.599
 did he literally have 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.229
 standing the famous phrase about what is forever possible 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.439
 look at something like that Korea is taken 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.070
 water 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.629
 and give salaries 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.040
 Secondly, each item has its own 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.629
 unique features 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.809
 dollars is generally difficult to bring all filed 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.549
 still in debt but because here for example 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.529
 maize on fire starts 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.999
 burst scattering around 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.909
 fresh popcorn odessa this country pc 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.469
 version of that inferno vgik stylizes the flame 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.809
 in short, the variability of their pores and mountains and mountains 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.159
 but most of all the game starts to please and 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.409
 surprise from the moment 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.739
 annoying 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.769
 fans 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.639
 which will start to write constantly 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.299
 a little book 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.979
 already concluded ask her 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.400
 and of course but quite meaningfully and not without 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.539
 the idea behind it 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.179
 I'm really starting here. 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.269
 there is a desire for ongoing parallel 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.779
 remember the story of Eugene Zamyatin 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.959
 cave and scored some sort of river but 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.319
 I didnâ€™t just say that 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.409
 final game 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.529
 card chip is nothing 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.519
 bang parents here obviously literally in one 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.650
 the evening does not leave behind in the shower 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.959
 gates of warm memories of emotions 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.289
 Needless to say the game is unlikely to succeed 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.280
 ox debt in which at one time 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.729
 demonstrated to the masses that 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.550
 indigo it is absolutely not necessary 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.220
 the crab fake who did this 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.800
 student clement knees 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.990
 however, to criticize her resolutely 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.849
 it turns out very nice design 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.449
 wonderful music easy on spectacular 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.470
 fighting complexity is fine 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.669
 balancing between waiting list and not 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.969
 obviously walls 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.469
 and in the end or penetrate 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.779
 concepts you are playing the game in one gulp 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.860
 evening or go out after 20 minutes 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.860
 perplexed that it is all there is on the field 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.059
 but I have it all 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.059
 Good luck to everyone and see you at 100 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.849
 below 5 with a coupon for a piece of paper 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.129
