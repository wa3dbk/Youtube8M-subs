00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.450 
backpack I don't know the pricing is on
these<00:04:51.750> because<00:04:51.960> it's<00:04:52.230> um<00:04:52.380> pretty<00:04:52.410> cetme<00:04:53.160> these

these because it's um pretty cetme these
so<00:04:53.760> I'm<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:54.030> positive<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:55.050> mean<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.470> really

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
so I'm not positive I mean you really

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100 
so I'm not positive I mean you really
don't<00:04:56.010> need<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.370> huge<00:04:56.910> thing<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.360> perfume<00:04:57.900> and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
don't need a huge thing of perfume and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.290
