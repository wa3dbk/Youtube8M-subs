maybe<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> curse<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> Bradford<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.500> mean

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
maybe it's the curse of Bradford I mean

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.150 
maybe it's the curse of Bradford I mean
we<00:00:59.489> did<00:00:59.760> verse<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.539> season<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we did verse them in season one when I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.420 
we did verse them in season one when I
was<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> Wickham<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:04.080> believe<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> our

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
was on Wickham and I believe one of our
players<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.240> traded<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:09.200> maybe<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
players got traded there and maybe it's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:10.969 
players got traded there and maybe it's
a<00:01:10.500> curse

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
