this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
this is the way that I look at it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
this is the way that I look at it
logically<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.030> find<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> queen<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> could

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
logically if you find a queen it could

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.179 
logically if you find a queen it could
be<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.110> things<00:01:43.320> sue<00:01:43.560> procedure<00:01:43.920> or

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
be one or two things sue procedure or

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
be one or two things sue procedure or
swarm<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.770> find<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.340> cell<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.509> middle

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
swarm if you find one cell in the middle

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
swarm if you find one cell in the middle
of<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> frame<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.329> cell<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.890> see

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
of a frame just the one cell and you see

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.410 
of a frame just the one cell and you see
the<00:01:53.189> signs<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> spotty<00:01:53.939> brood<00:01:54.210> pattern

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the signs like a spotty brood pattern

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
the signs like a spotty brood pattern
may<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.780> no<00:01:54.960> brood<00:01:55.200> pattern<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
may be no brood pattern to me that's a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
may be no brood pattern to me that's a
dead<00:01:56.729> giveaway<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.240> suit<00:01:57.390> procedure<00:01:57.689> if

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
dead giveaway that's a suit procedure if

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.709 
dead giveaway that's a suit procedure if
you<00:01:58.590> find<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> queen<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.820> find<00:02:00.090> eggs<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you find the queen and you find eggs and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
you find the queen and you find eggs and
you<00:02:00.960> find<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.380> population<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> bees<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you find a good population of bees and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
you find a good population of bees and
you<00:02:02.640> find<00:02:02.880> several<00:02:03.180> cells<00:02:03.509> scattered<00:02:03.780> about

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you find several cells scattered about

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.719 
you find several cells scattered about
not<00:02:04.590> necessarily<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> bottom<00:02:05.610> that's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
not necessarily on the bottom that's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.650 
not necessarily on the bottom that's
scattered<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:07.129> probably<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> swarm<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
scattered about probably a swarm so I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.210 
scattered about probably a swarm so I
just<00:02:10.050> told<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> class<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
just told the class this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
just told the class this
and<00:02:11.970> someone<00:02:12.300> said<00:02:12.420> I'll<00:02:12.510> win<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.020> when

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and someone said I'll win you know when

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.780 
and someone said I'll win you know when
we<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.740> see<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> swarm<00:02:14.100> song<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.400> said<00:02:14.640> well<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
we get to see a swarm song I said well I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
we get to see a swarm song I said well I
hope<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.630> storm<00:02:15.900> cell<00:02:16.140> or<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.740> said

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
hope not we can storm cell or they said

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.080 
hope not we can storm cell or they said
well<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> Queen<00:02:17.520> cells<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.880> said<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
well we get to the Queen cells I said I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.490 
well we get to the Queen cells I said I
hope<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.630> Queen<00:02:18.930> cell<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.260> think

hope not because Queen cell I think
something's<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.030> not

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so anyway we pop open the hive and right

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.990 
so anyway we pop open the hive and right
off<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> bat<00:02:29.490> Queen<00:02:29.970> cells<00:02:30.240> yay<00:02:30.990> good<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.710> me

not what I wanted to find but it's what

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.650 
not what I wanted to find but it's what
we<00:02:34.140> found<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.770> said<00:02:35.040> well<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.430> said<00:02:35.660> the

we found so I said well I said the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.240 
we found so I said well I said the
population<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.290> hype<00:02:37.440> doesn't<00:02:37.800> appear<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
population was hype doesn't appear that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.340 
population was hype doesn't appear that
strong<00:02:38.580> they<00:02:39.330> could<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.660> swarm<00:02:39.930> cells<00:02:40.170> could

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
strong they could be swarm cells could

be the hive a swarmed out you know

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.810 
be the hive a swarmed out you know
doesn't<00:02:42.900> hive<00:02:43.350> not<00:02:43.530> crowded<00:02:43.950> by<00:02:44.040> any<00:02:44.160> means<00:02:44.340> so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
doesn't hive not crowded by any means so

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.400 
doesn't hive not crowded by any means so
maybe<00:02:45.000> they've<00:02:45.120> already<00:02:45.210> stormed<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.290> then

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
maybe they've already stormed and then

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.020 
maybe they've already stormed and then

pulling swarm cells so you know I was

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.199 
pulling swarm cells so you know I was
thump<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.100> really<00:03:17.340> was<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:17.880> told<00:03:18.060> these

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
people you know yeah just tight this is

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890 
people you know yeah just tight this is
how<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.860> tell<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:21.270> then<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.480> come<00:03:21.810> across

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
how you tell it and then I come across

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.110 
how you tell it and then I come across
that<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.550> now<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> found<00:03:24.000> myself

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that so you know now I found myself

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.470 
that so you know now I found myself
thinking<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:25.430> don't<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:27.180> know<00:03:27.300> it's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
thinking I don't know you know it's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210 
thinking I don't know you know it's
possible<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.989> guess<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.260> kicked<00:03:28.470> off<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
possible I guess they kicked off of a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.090 
possible I guess they kicked off of a
queenless<00:03:29.970> swarm<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.570> guess<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.350> left<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
queenless swarm I guess I left the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.720 
queenless swarm I guess I left the
original<00:03:32.430> Queen<00:03:32.580> behind<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:34.280> don't<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
original Queen behind I don't think it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.130 
original Queen behind I don't think it
was<00:03:35.850> super<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.360> juror<00:03:36.570> all<00:03:36.780> though<00:03:36.930> they<00:03:37.080> were

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
was super see juror all though they were

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.440 
was super see juror all though they were
I<00:03:37.680> caught<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.610> Queen<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.030> moved<00:03:39.209> her<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.330> a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
I caught the Queen that moved her to a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.940 
I caught the Queen that moved her to a
new<00:03:39.510> box<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.290> shook<00:03:40.500> some<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.800> bees

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
new box and I shook some of the bees

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280 
new box and I shook some of the bees
moving<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.489> box<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.840> shook<00:03:43.080> some<00:03:43.230> of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
moving to this box and I shook some of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.360 
moving to this box and I shook some of
the<00:03:43.350> bees<00:03:43.470> over<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.040> they<00:03:44.130> didn't

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the bees over to it and they didn't

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.280 
the bees over to it and they didn't
really<00:03:44.550> seem<00:03:44.820> all<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.300> excited<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.140> with

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
really seem all that excited to be with

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.360 
really seem all that excited to be with
her<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.590> maybe<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:46.950> because<00:03:47.160> they

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
her and maybe it's just because they

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.640 
her and maybe it's just because they
weren't<00:03:47.489> too<00:03:47.700> stirred<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.500> know<00:03:49.500> when<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
weren't too stirred up you know when I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.020 
weren't too stirred up you know when I
do<00:03:49.709> removals<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.370> catch<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.700> Queen<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
do removals and I catch the Queen and

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.400 
do removals and I catch the Queen and
move<00:03:51.120> or<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.360> beaver<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.780> sorts<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.200> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
move or the beaver all sorts of this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.780 
move or the beaver all sorts of this
place<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.830> know<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.220> they're<00:03:53.340> happiest

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
place you know so then they're happiest

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.070 
place you know so then they're happiest
claims<00:03:54.060> when<00:03:54.269> they<00:03:54.330> find<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> Queen<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:54.989> they

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
claims when they find the Queen so they

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.229 
claims when they find the Queen so they
just<00:03:55.260> cover<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.680> cave<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.760> case<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.120> just

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
just cover the cave in this case it just

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.479 
just cover the cave in this case it just
kind<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.420> act<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.690> she<00:03:57.900> wasn't<00:03:58.050> there

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
kind of act like she wasn't there

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.490 
kind of act like she wasn't there
but<00:04:00.420> they're<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.690> box<00:04:00.870> now<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.140> haven't

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
but they're in the box now I haven't

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.560 
but they're in the box now I haven't
popped<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.830> lid<00:04:01.920> off<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> couple<00:04:02.519> days<00:04:02.640> I

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
popped the lid off in a couple days I

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.360 
popped the lid off in a couple days I
just<00:04:03.870> made<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> real<00:04:04.410> small<00:04:04.620> split<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.160> enough

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
just made a real small split just enough

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.500 
just made a real small split just enough
to<00:04:05.459> take<00:04:05.580> advantage<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.090> Queen<00:04:06.300> without

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
to take advantage of that Queen without

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.660 
to take advantage of that Queen without
the<00:04:06.690> Queen<00:04:06.900> cells<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.260> hatch<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.650> or<00:04:08.459> whatever

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
the Queen cells to hatch out or whatever

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.550 
the Queen cells to hatch out or whatever
is<00:04:08.730> going<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.910> happen<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.290> was<00:04:10.410> kind<00:04:10.530> of

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
is going to happen but I was kind of

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.810 
is going to happen but I was kind of
curious<00:04:10.739> what<00:04:10.950> y'all<00:04:11.160> saw<00:04:11.340> her<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.760> one

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
curious what y'all saw her on this one

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.870 
curious what y'all saw her on this one
so<00:04:12.090> again<00:04:12.890> active<00:04:13.890> Queen<00:04:14.130> she<00:04:14.550> looks<00:04:14.730> healthy

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
so again active Queen she looks healthy

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.099 
so again active Queen she looks healthy
she<00:04:15.330> looks<00:04:15.540> fine<00:04:16.850> multiple<00:04:17.850> cells

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
she looks fine multiple cells

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.629 
she looks fine multiple cells
not<00:04:19.439> what<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> would<00:04:19.829> call<00:04:19.949> suit<00:04:20.220> procedures

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
not what I would call suit procedures

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.129 
not what I would call suit procedures
and<00:04:20.819> all<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> edges<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.599> columns<00:04:21.930> where

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
and all the edges of the columns where

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.110 
and all the edges of the columns where
most<00:04:22.319> people<00:04:22.379> say<00:04:22.650> there's<00:04:22.889> forms<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
most people say there's forms but the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.119 
most people say there's forms but the
population<00:04:24.689> is<00:04:24.780> not<00:04:24.930> high<00:04:25.229> enough<00:04:25.259> to<00:04:25.770> warrant

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
population is not high enough to warrant

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.830 
population is not high enough to warrant
this<00:04:26.280> one<00:04:26.580> population<00:04:27.120> less<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.479> was<00:04:27.659> never

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
this one population less I was never

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.950 
this one population less I was never
high<00:04:28.050> now<00:04:28.289> when<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.849> when<00:04:29.849> I<00:04:29.879> made<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.270> when<00:04:30.900> I

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
high now when I when I made this when I

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.330 
high now when I when I made this when I
made<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.259> high<00:04:31.500> up<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.800> these<00:04:34.979> two<00:04:35.129> or<00:04:35.159> three

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
made that high up for these two or three

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.429 
made that high up for these two or three
weeks<00:04:35.520> ago<00:04:35.669> when<00:04:35.819> I<00:04:35.879> last<00:04:36.090> worked<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.569> it<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:37.439 
weeks ago when I last worked on it the

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.689 
weeks ago when I last worked on it the
population<00:04:37.979> wasn't<00:04:38.250> all<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.340> high<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.610> I

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
population wasn't all that high it I

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.100 
population wasn't all that high it I
think<00:04:38.879> they<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:39.030> recently<00:04:39.569> formed<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.900> can't

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
think they just recently formed I can't

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.140 
think they just recently formed I can't
remove<00:04:40.289> for<00:04:40.469> sure<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:40.889> population<00:04:41.879> was<00:04:42.000> not

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
remove for sure but population was not

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.770 
remove for sure but population was not
that<00:04:42.360> high<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.979> don't<00:04:44.430> know<00:04:44.539> y'all<00:04:45.539> tell<00:04:45.750> me

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
that high so I don't know y'all tell me

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.909 
that high so I don't know y'all tell me
which<00:04:45.990> thoughts<00:04:46.259> are<00:04:46.409> if<00:04:46.469> you've<00:04:46.590> seen<00:04:46.770> this

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
which thoughts are if you've seen this

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.890 
which thoughts are if you've seen this
like<00:04:47.099> I<00:04:47.129> said<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.849> looked<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.419> swarming

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
like I said it it looked like swarming

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.260 
like I said it it looked like swarming
but<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.009> me<00:04:50.099> there<00:04:50.250> just<00:04:50.490> was<00:04:50.639> not<00:04:50.789> enough<00:04:51.090> bees

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
but to me there just was not enough bees

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.850 
but to me there just was not enough bees
to<00:04:51.479> want<00:04:51.629> a<00:04:51.659> swarm<00:04:51.870> at<00:04:52.080> all<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.530> there's<00:04:52.800> no

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
to want a swarm at all and there's no

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.050 
to want a swarm at all and there's no
reason<00:04:53.280> at<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> way<00:04:53.699> they<00:04:53.819> should<00:04:53.879> have

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
reason at all the way they should have

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.499 
reason at all the way they should have
wanted<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.300> one<00:04:55.699> but<00:04:56.699> that<00:04:56.729> was<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.240> that

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
wanted this one but that was the that

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.089 
wanted this one but that was the that
was<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.719> indicators<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.650> then<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.919> Queen

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
was the indicators and then the Queen

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.809 
was the indicators and then the Queen
was<00:04:59.250> there<00:04:59.400> she<00:04:59.669> was<00:04:59.759> laying<00:04:59.969> she<00:05:00.360> was<00:05:00.479> active

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
was there she was laying she was active

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.010 
was there she was laying she was active
but<00:05:02.819> pulling<00:05:03.060> what<00:05:03.240> looked<00:05:03.419> like<00:05:03.479> Sloane<00:05:03.750> says

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
but pulling what looked like Sloane says

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.450 
but pulling what looked like Sloane says
so<00:05:04.259> I<00:05:04.500> don't<00:05:04.830> know<00:05:04.889> if<00:05:04.979> y'all<00:05:05.159> turn<00:05:05.310> which

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
so I don't know if y'all turn which

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.669 
so I don't know if y'all turn which
thing
