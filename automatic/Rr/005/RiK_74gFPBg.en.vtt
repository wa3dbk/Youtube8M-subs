00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this box to keep it even as it's falling

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
this box to keep it even as it's falling
down<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.789> its<00:00:29.939> back<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> onto<00:00:30.510> its<00:00:30.630> face<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
down to its back and onto its face and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.299 
down to its back and onto its face and
we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.679> using<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> measuring

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we're going to be using the measuring

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.709 
we're going to be using the measuring
stick<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> keep<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> even<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.600> down

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
stick to keep it even as it's going down

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
stick to keep it even as it's going down
onto<00:00:33.960> its<00:00:34.140> corner<00:00:34.469> drop<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> try

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
onto its corner drop just going to try

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.500 
onto its corner drop just going to try
to<00:00:35.430> add<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:35.969> consistency

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to add a little bit more consistency

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
to add a little bit more consistency
alright<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.620> we're<00:00:37.739> gonna<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
alright so we're gonna start with the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.800 
alright so we're gonna start with the
backdrop<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.969> three<00:00:39.360> two<00:00:40.170> one

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.970 

all<00:00:44.810> right<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.110> obviously<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.560> front<00:00:45.800> looks

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
all right so obviously the front looks

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.140 
all right so obviously the front looks
like<00:00:46.070> it's<00:00:46.220> doing<00:00:46.340> all<00:00:46.580> right<00:00:46.610> touch<00:00:46.940> screen

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
like it's doing all right touch screen

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.840 
like it's doing all right touch screen
is<00:00:47.240> working<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:48.110> back<00:00:48.410> looks<00:00:49.340> like<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.700> is

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
is working the back looks like it is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.430 
is working the back looks like it is
definitely<00:00:50.450> dented<00:00:50.750> up<00:00:50.810> a<00:00:50.960> little<00:00:51.140> bit<00:00:51.260> it's

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
definitely dented up a little bit it's

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.260 
definitely dented up a little bit it's
more<00:00:51.770> scratched<00:00:52.130> up<00:00:52.400> than<00:00:52.580> we<00:00:52.700> normally<00:00:52.850> get

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
more scratched up than we normally get

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.690 
more scratched up than we normally get
on<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.510> back<00:00:53.690> drops<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:54.830> it's<00:00:55.250> still<00:00:55.430> fully

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
on the back drops but it's still fully

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.220 
on the back drops but it's still fully
functional<00:00:56.240> so<00:00:56.510> that's<00:00:56.720> definitely<00:00:56.960> a

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
functional so that's definitely a

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.690 
functional so that's definitely a
survival<00:00:57.740> let's<00:00:58.160> go<00:00:58.220> ahead<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:58.490> onto<00:00:58.610> the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
survival let's go ahead and get onto the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
survival let's go ahead and get onto the
side<00:00:58.940> drop<00:00:59.150> three<00:00:59.870> two<00:01:00.830> one

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.200 

all<00:01:12.040> right<00:01:12.340> ah<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:14.979> go<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.850> corner

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
all right ah there we go that corner

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.880 
all right ah there we go that corner
there<00:01:16.420> looks<00:01:16.780> pretty<00:01:16.990> nasty<00:01:17.200> it's<00:01:17.560> got<00:01:17.680> like<00:01:17.830> a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
there looks pretty nasty it's got like a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.440 
there looks pretty nasty it's got like a
big<00:01:18.040> dents<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.520> here<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.820> corner<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.300> it's

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
big dents up here in the corner and it's

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.240 
big dents up here in the corner and it's
a<00:01:19.540> little<00:01:19.840> bit<00:01:19.990> separated<00:01:20.229> around<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> edge

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
a little bit separated around the edge

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.700 
a little bit separated around the edge
of<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.490> screen<00:01:21.640> not<00:01:22.450> significantly<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:23.500> like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
of the screen not significantly so like

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.170 
of the screen not significantly so like
I<00:01:23.799> bet<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.130> still<00:01:24.460> functional<00:01:25.000> let's<00:01:25.119> go

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
I bet that still functional let's go

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.100 
I bet that still functional let's go
ahead<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.390> test<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.630> screen<00:01:25.900> real<00:01:26.050> quick

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
ahead and test the screen real quick

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.580 
ahead and test the screen real quick
just<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.470> make<00:01:26.619> sure<00:01:28.290> yeah<00:01:29.290> yeah<00:01:29.409> we

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
just to make sure yeah yeah we

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.990 
just to make sure yeah yeah we
definitely<00:01:29.740> have<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> fully<00:01:30.550> functional

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
definitely have a fully functional

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.060 
definitely have a fully functional
screen<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.420> that's<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.659> survival<00:01:32.200> no<00:01:32.770> cracked

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
screen so that's a survival no cracked

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.620 
screen so that's a survival no cracked
screen<00:01:33.430> or<00:01:33.580> anything<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:34.060> I'd<00:01:34.210> say<00:01:34.509> that's

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
screen or anything so I'd say that's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.240 
screen or anything so I'd say that's
that's<00:01:35.259> pretty<00:01:35.500> decent<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.100> still

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
that's pretty decent but it's still

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.550 
that's pretty decent but it's still
definitely<00:01:36.430> some<00:01:36.759> cosmetic<00:01:37.240> damage<00:01:37.560> all
