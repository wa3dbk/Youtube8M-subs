 you know I can not eat bread but 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.780
 so if I could, so I had to go through 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 like five days impact I said go there 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.639
 somewhere in this city ​​where 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 have bread one of my friends said yes there is 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.900
 an American restaurant called 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.470
 American colony hotel let's go 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 there to eat we went for lunch and we 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 we sat and we were settling in and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 reading the letter when the waiter in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 boss came over and handed us a brochure 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 that told the story of the hotel and its 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 restaurant amazed me to learn that the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.870
 hotel where we were eating in a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.800
 time belonged to the family of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.329
 horacio spafford thank you for ford is the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610
 man who wrote the letter of the hymn 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 favorite when I read the brochure that I 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 they gave there that was full of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.480
 information that I had never heard before 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.100
 so I'm going to tell you to conclude 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 this message in 1871 2 spofford lived 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.899
 in a suburb of chicago he was a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 Young lawyer and his wife Anna 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.580
 they had four daughters in October of that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.430
 year the entire center of the city ​​was 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 devastated by a fire nobody knew 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 how it started but it killed hundreds of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 people and destroyed entire sections of 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 the city ​​all over the city the people 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.100
 he wandered without a place to live and with 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 hunger and the mirrors intervened 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.770
 deeply doing everything 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 they could to help families 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 damaged but it was not a ministry to 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 short term 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.430
 two years later having lived from that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.020
 way day after day they were totally 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.909
 exhausted by your work so 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.430
 They planned to go to Europe in search of a 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.680
 vacation time and rest to last 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.079
 minute business matters prevented 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.869
 that horacio would travel but his wife arrived 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.840
 and four daughters to ship 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 they boarded and they stopped very late 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.360
 night during the trip another boat collided 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.509
 with his and the ship sank in 20 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 minutes only 47 people were 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.150
 rescued 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.560
 was taken out of the unconscious water it 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.470
 they found floating on a piece of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.500
 debris but the four spafford girls 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.180
 They died when Anna came to earth 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.510
 sent a telegram from paris to his 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.840
 husband the telegram said saved alone 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.910
 that I must be that another passenger commented 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.340
 that God had given him four daughters and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.760
 that he had taken them yes maybe 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.530
 Someday I would understand why Asia 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 He embarked on another ship to go in search 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.100
 of his wife and bring her back to the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.320
 The route of the ship in which he was traveling crossed 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.480
 for the same point where the daughters 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.950
 they had drowned the captain called him to his 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 cabin and told Horace 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 deeply touched he found a piece 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.820
 paper from the hotel in which he had 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.450
 stayed before the trip and wrote the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.790
 words of the hymn is fine with my soul 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.900
 which has now become one of the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.269
 most famous signs of the world 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.849
 Horacio looked for his wife and they returned to 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.250
 home back in chicago they tried to 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.489
 start it all over again they were born a 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.489
 son 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 and then another beautiful girl maybe what 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.740
 worst had happened but then another 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.650
 tragedy his four-year-old son died 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.260
 for scarlet fever even if you do not 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.050
 creates the family church doctor the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.480
 notion of they decided to leave the us and 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.220
 start a new life in jerusalem like this 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.830
 who rented a house in the old part 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.660
 of the city and his goal was to imitate 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 the lives of the first Christians 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.100
 century as close as possible 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.140
 soon the family was recognized 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 widely for their love and service to the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.060
 needy as well as for their 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.180
 devotion to the sacred scriptures and today 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.450
 the spafford children's center serves 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.560
 jerusalem and the western margin 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.780
 providing health care and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.710
 educational services to something like 30 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.300
 thousand children every year under the 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.600
 leadership of the descendants of 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.450
 stafford 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.370
 from the ashes of his tragedy the god 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.090
 almighty raised a work that 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.100
 we could not understand removes 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.100
 this the sadness of the lost children 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.500
 but it shows that even in the middle of what 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.699
 harder it happens that god is working 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.099
 my eyes are working anna and horacio 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.560
 stafford suffered these tests of their 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.080
 faith but they did not blame God for their 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.090
 suffering they knew he was in 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.789
 control of all things and because of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.940
 that he can not be defeated either 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.710
 they could be so their faith 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.050
 allowed to learn through these tests 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.199
 to use their pain to bless others and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.590
 spread the gospel god is today the 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.569
 same god as it was then what 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.110
 happens in these tragedies if one observes 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:00.469
 with attention and listen and look here and 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.830
 there will be something that springs from that and that 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:05.960
 it's for god and his glory is not my 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.419
 intention to be insensitive to bending and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.940
 loss of those who have gone through this and 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.800
 I also have no capacity to 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.949
 give you all the reasoning regarding 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.659
 why this was allowed to happen the 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.479
 that I do know is this 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.849
 we serve a good god we are 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.510
 limited in our ability to 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.880
 understand it 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.610
 in the heart of god but one day when 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.330
 we are sitting around the throne 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.480
 we will ask this question and with certainty the 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.500
 God's answer will be much better than the 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.020
 that has been mine 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.810
 this is a biblical verse so that 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.420
 write down and remember this verse for 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.220
 when someone asks you questions this is 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.650
 what we know with certainty we do not know 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.980
 many things by the way but if we know 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.980
 this with certainty god is our protection 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.290
 and strength, our early help in 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.630
 the tribulations therefore we will not fear 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.700
 although the earth is removed and 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.250
 they cross the mountains to the heart of the sea 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.500
 though it roars neither be troubled in its waters and 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.680
 the mountains tremble because of their head 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.680
 God is our refuge and he is 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.310
 enough for whatever it is that 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.310
 we face 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.759
 Y 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.500
 working in the big commission this is 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.500
 our radio 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.299
 our radio point or heretic 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.280
 the evil of heaven declares its power
