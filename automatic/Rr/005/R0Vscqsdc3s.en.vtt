that I'm worried about in this service
is<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> business<00:01:34.020> model<00:01:34.229> they've<00:01:34.500> made

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is that the business model they've made

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.080 
is that the business model they've made
is<00:01:34.920> based<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.490> eighty-eight<00:01:36.060> percent

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
is based on eighty-eight percent

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
is based on eighty-eight percent
occupancy<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.740> sure<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
occupancy I'm not sure that's going to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
occupancy I'm not sure that's going to
be<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.610> easy<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> achieve<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:39.780> times

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
be very easy to achieve in these times

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
be very easy to achieve in these times
when<00:01:40.290> people<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.740> afford<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.250> travel<00:01:41.430> faster

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
when people can afford to travel faster

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.690 
when people can afford to travel faster
come<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.530> other<00:01:43.680> thing<00:01:43.950> yes<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> think

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
come back the other thing yes I think

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
come back the other thing yes I think
that<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> direction

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that is good about this is the direction

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
that is good about this is the direction
that<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.770> shows<00:01:46.979> us<00:01:47.159> privatization<00:01:48.090> because

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that this shows us privatization because

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.690 
that this shows us privatization because
i<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.750> railways<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.040> authorities<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
i think the railways the authorities the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
i think the railways the authorities the
government<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.180> been<00:01:51.299> trying<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.600> run<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
government has been trying to run the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
government has been trying to run the
service<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.560> 60-odd<00:01:53.220> years<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.909> got<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
service for what 60-odd years they got a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
service for what 60-odd years they got a
pretty<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.420> service<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.439> they've

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pretty good service and now they've

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
pretty good service and now they've
ruined<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> blender<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> literally<00:01:56.939> run<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
ruined it blender it literally run it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.600 
ruined it blender it literally run it
into<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> ground<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.680> privatization

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
into the ground so I think privatization

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
into the ground so I think privatization
is<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> way<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.570> again<00:02:00.869> pricing<00:02:01.380> has

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is the way to go but again pricing has

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
is the way to go but again pricing has
to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> key<00:02:02.009> factor<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> spoke<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to be a key factor now I spoke to a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060 
to be a key factor now I spoke to a
couple<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.840> people<00:02:04.140> who<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:04.380> used<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> use

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
couple of people who usually used to use

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
couple of people who usually used to use
trains<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.810> ease

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
trains when they would go back on ease

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.350 
trains when they would go back on ease
or<00:02:07.409> other<00:02:07.619> national<00:02:08.429> holidays<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> they're

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
or other national holidays and they're

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930 
or other national holidays and they're
now<00:02:09.479> opted<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.899> by<00:02:10.140> bus<00:02:10.379> two<00:02:10.950> reasons<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
now opted to go by bus two reasons the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.890 
now opted to go by bus two reasons the
buses<00:02:12.150> are

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
buses are

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.350 
buses are
cheaper<00:02:13.140> than<00:02:13.319> trains<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.040> secondly<00:02:14.909> there

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
cheaper than trains and secondly there

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720 
cheaper than trains and secondly there
faster<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.769> an<00:02:16.950> 18<00:02:17.220> hour<00:02:17.340> service

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
faster now this is an 18 hour service

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520 
faster now this is an 18 hour service
and<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.239> considered<00:02:18.629> non<00:02:18.870> stop<00:02:19.230> they

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and this is considered non stop they

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.050 
and this is considered non stop they
have<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.829> 20<00:02:20.189> minutes<00:02:20.340> tops<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:20.849> that's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have to 20 minutes tops but that's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.440 
have to 20 minutes tops but that's
fairly<00:02:21.810> small<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.040> non<00:02:23.310> stop<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.819> 18<00:02:24.120> hours

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
fairly small and non stop is 18 hours

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
fairly small and non stop is 18 hours
the<00:02:24.840> buses<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:25.769> faster<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:26.459> less

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the buses get you there faster in less

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.759 
the buses get you there faster in less
than<00:02:26.879> 18<00:02:27.150> hours<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.750> why<00:02:27.900> would<00:02:28.079> they<00:02:28.110> opt<00:02:28.500> for

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
than 18 hours so why would they opt for

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.649 
than 18 hours so why would they opt for
a<00:02:28.799> train<00:02:29.129> service<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.090> normal<00:02:30.450> train

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
a train service and the normal train

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.240 
a train service and the normal train
services<00:02:31.109> do<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.709> there<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:31.920> 18

luxury of traveling in style and may be

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.589 
luxury of traveling in style and may be
more<00:02:44.430> relaxed<00:02:45.000> than<00:02:45.030> they<00:02:45.239> are<00:02:45.389> on<00:02:45.420> an

more relaxed than they are on an
