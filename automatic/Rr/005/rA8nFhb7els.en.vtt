different<00:03:17.100> developer<00:03:17.519> you're<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:17.910> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
different developer you're not going to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.330 
different developer you're not going to
have<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.329> exact<00:03:18.750> same<00:03:19.019> model<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.829> i<00:03:19.860> noticed

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
have the exact same model so i noticed

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.729 
have the exact same model so i noticed
that<00:03:20.400> master<00:03:20.880> chief<00:03:21.380> slightly<00:03:22.380> different

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
that master chief slightly different

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.560 
that master chief slightly different
from<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:22.980> he<00:03:23.040> previously<00:03:23.549> did<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:23.970> halo<00:03:24.269> 3

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
from what he previously did in halo 3

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.970 
from what he previously did in halo 3
but<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.959> not<00:03:25.079> really<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.620> big<00:03:25.799> issue

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
but it's not really much of a big issue

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.250 
but it's not really much of a big issue
today<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.519> what<00:03:27.390> about<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.720> aliens<00:03:28.110> from

you my honest opinion on that I think

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.449 
you my honest opinion on that I think
it's<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.350> completely<00:03:37.950> something

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it's going to be completely something

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.680 
it's going to be completely something
brand<00:03:38.790> new<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.209> you're<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.630> really

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
brand new I think you're going to really

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.199 
brand new I think you're going to really
innovate<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.380> Halo<00:03:40.680> series<00:03:40.709> by<00:03:41.549> introducing

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
innovate the Halo series by introducing

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.780 
innovate the Halo series by introducing
a<00:03:42.329> new<00:03:42.359> alien<00:03:42.720> race<00:03:43.200> now<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.340> many<00:03:44.609> other

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
a new alien race now like many other

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.849 
a new alien race now like many other
people<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.299> speculated<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:46.049> Master<00:03:46.620> Chief

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
people have speculated that Master Chief

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.979 
people have speculated that Master Chief
and<00:03:47.040> Cortana<00:03:47.370> will<00:03:47.609> land<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.299> some<00:03:48.630> other<00:03:48.750> kind

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and Cortana will land on some other kind

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.199 
and Cortana will land on some other kind
of<00:03:49.140> planet<00:03:49.560> or<00:03:49.739> some<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.609> place<00:03:50.880> well

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
of planet or some of the place well

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.880 
of planet or some of the place well
they'll<00:03:51.390> fight<00:03:51.630> off<00:03:51.780> other<00:03:51.989> type<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.410> aliens

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
they'll fight off other type of aliens

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.620 
they'll fight off other type of aliens
so<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:54.030> think<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.299> going<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.540> a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
so I really think it's going to be a

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.120 
so I really think it's going to be a
very<00:03:54.810> interesting<00:03:55.140> story<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.920> they<00:03:56.070> do

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
very interesting story if they do

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.640 
very interesting story if they do
introduce<00:03:56.700> new<00:03:56.970> aliens<00:03:57.359> because<00:03:57.540> with<00:03:58.440> new

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
introduce new aliens because with new

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.530 
introduce new aliens because with new
aliens<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.250> has<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.579> be<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.730> new<00:03:59.880> story<00:04:00.239> right

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
aliens that has to be a new story right

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.080 
aliens that has to be a new story right
all<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.380> all<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.709> think<00:04:01.769> 343<00:04:02.519> Industries<00:04:02.940> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
all in all I think 343 Industries is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.180 
all in all I think 343 Industries is
going<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.329> do<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> very<00:04:03.840> good<00:04:03.930> job<00:04:04.109> on<00:04:04.560> Halo<00:04:04.799> 4

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
going to do a very good job on Halo 4

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.740 
going to do a very good job on Halo 4
and<00:04:05.459> for<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> future<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.329> Halo<00:04:06.630> series

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and for the future of the Halo series

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.319 
and for the future of the Halo series
that's<00:04:07.320> right<00:04:07.590> i'm<00:04:08.040> sure<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.489> halo<00:04:08.700> 4<00:04:09.060> won't

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
that's right i'm sure the halo 4 won't

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.539 
that's right i'm sure the halo 4 won't
be<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.570> only<00:04:09.600> game<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.170> 343<00:04:10.920> industries<00:04:11.400> is
