 We receive an impression of the first branch glasses 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.600
 I think the wheel is the best 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.610
 First of all I would like to see the movement of the final save 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.760

 He worked as an acid biaxially woman wind 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.479

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.550
 Not heavy 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.400

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.750
 Well it's interesting to look at if you say strong or weak 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:15.910
 It feels so or paralysis weak 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.730
 But the beer is good, I think it will be very strong if remodel 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.760
 The playfulness of the final survive is also 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.920
