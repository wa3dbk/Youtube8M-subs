00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.059
 I am Maria and this techno kitchen and so recently 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 we collected a good summer system for 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.100
 40,000 but some lucky 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.590
 it will not seem to users 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 cool lucky because they have 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.019
 money and have the opportunity to pamper 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 yourself tricked out with a computer and so 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.550
 we will do to start remove ask all 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 what's to stop us from making a computer 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.370
 great we will choose a processor with an index 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.469
 kei i.e. unlocked multiplier 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.100
 so that nothing prevents good acceleration 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.440
 and so say goodbye to 4440 mother let 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.719
 will asus to no glitches and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 obstacles with overclocking further take 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.449
 power supply reserve for future housing 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 more spacious firmly ik more and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.149
 winchester fatter also smoke better 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.449
 all winter aiming for strong overclocking 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.719
 so let's go for the basis of us left 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 only video card and memory 16 gigabytes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.140
 i5 4670 kate processor is enough 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 overclocking will not yield to any other 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.750
 processor on the motherboard market 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.630
 asus and with the condition that supports 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.330
 and cross and slide further we decided 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.850
 put the second r9 290 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 and since the system allows and we collect 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.939
 really powerful gaming computer 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.189
 a power supply of 850 watts is enough 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 picked up with high quality gold 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.900
 certificate model from corsair as 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 housing chosen ample 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.840
 blown model with a transparent window 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 240 gigabytes for the system and games 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.549
 solid-state memory will probably 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.710
 well all the more it costs four 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.340
 half a thousand not so expensive 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.720
 3 terabytes under the trash file and of course 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.719
 thermolite cooler 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.369
 mature to cool in silence and whom 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.190
 sixty eight and a half thousand 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.280
 rubles for 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 if quiet modern computer might 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.800
 probably enough for seven years 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.690
 if the gaming industry develops 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.040
 at a snail's pace like now 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.010
 it was our opinion and with you was maria 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.430
 see you if the system is expensive for you 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.580
 click on the link there assembly twice 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.580
 cheaper
