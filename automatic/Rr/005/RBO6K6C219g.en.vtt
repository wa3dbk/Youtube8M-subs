resembles<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.479> than<00:01:33.659> black<00:01:33.810> ops

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

simply<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
simply because i did not like it and it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.080 
simply because i did not like it and it
frustrated<00:01:45.240> me<00:01:46.490> alright<00:01:47.490> well<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:47.880> my

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
frustrated me alright well that's my

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
frustrated me alright well that's my
basic<00:01:48.450> opinion<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.170> black<00:01:49.409> ops<00:01:49.619> 2<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
basic opinion on black ops 2 and how it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.170 
basic opinion on black ops 2 and how it
compares<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.270> modify<00:01:51.600> 3<00:01:51.899> specifically<00:01:53.180> but

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
compares to modify 3 specifically but

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
compares to modify 3 specifically but
without<00:01:54.600> further<00:01:54.899> ado<00:01:55.320> let's<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.310> right

without further ado let's just get right
to<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.119> gameplay<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.130> split

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
