inside with everything unboxed let's
give<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> rundown<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
give you a rundown of what there is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.380 
give you a rundown of what there is
there's<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.020> bag<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.860> detail<00:01:50.280> parts<00:01:51.210> which

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
there's this bag of detail parts which

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.039 
there's this bag of detail parts which
is<00:01:51.570> pipes<00:01:52.399> couplers<00:01:53.399> both<00:01:54.090> chain<00:01:54.630> link<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is pipes couplers both chain link and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.639 
is pipes couplers both chain link and
nem<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:58.009> coupler<00:01:59.009> covers<00:01:59.520> which<00:01:59.700> gone<00:01:59.969> from

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
nem and coupler covers which gone from

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.130 
nem and coupler covers which gone from
so<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:03.060> too<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.390> detail<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so that's that not too much detail it's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100 
so that's that not too much detail it's
just<00:02:04.380> enough<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.899> some

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
just enough there and I think some

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.900 
just enough there and I think some
companies<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.649> provide<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
companies just provide that much that it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.680 
companies just provide that much that it
makes<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> front<00:02:09.479> buffer<00:02:10.080> being<00:02:10.500> crowded

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
makes the front buffer being crowded

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.900 
makes the front buffer being crowded
and<00:02:12.960> we've<00:02:13.140> obviously<00:02:13.260> got<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.710> 56<00:02:14.340> running

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and we've obviously got the 56 running

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.160 
and we've obviously got the 56 running
instructions<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:15.660> I've<00:02:15.840> never<00:02:15.930> seen

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
instructions which I've never seen

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.560 
instructions which I've never seen
before<00:02:16.520> because<00:02:17.520> I've<00:02:17.790> never<00:02:17.820> seen<00:02:18.270> one<00:02:18.330> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
these types of 56 is before obviously

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.850 
these types of 56 is before obviously
I've<00:02:22.080> seen<00:02:22.560> 56<00:02:23.340> before<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.350> yeah<00:02:25.530> it's

just where to fit the parts body removal

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.310 
just where to fit the parts body removal
and<00:02:29.630> decoder<00:02:30.630> installation<00:02:31.320> lubrication<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320

wealth of fine detail it's it's a very

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
balanced way actually it's not there's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.760 
balanced way actually it's not there's
not<00:04:40.670> a<00:04:40.700> lot<00:04:40.970> but<00:04:41.270> there's<00:04:41.480> enough<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.260> keep<00:04:42.590> it

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
not a lot but there's enough to keep it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.450 
not a lot but there's enough to keep it
going<00:04:43.070> I'd<00:04:43.370> say<00:04:43.640> it's<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.880> bit<00:04:44.090> heavier<00:04:44.540> or

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
going I'd say it's a bit heavier or

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.880 
going I'd say it's a bit heavier or
about<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.670> same<00:04:46.700> as<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.330> 60<00:04:47.840> which<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:48.470> as<00:04:48.650> you

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
about the same as the 60 which is as you

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.470 
about the same as the 60 which is as you
can<00:04:49.010> tell<00:04:49.190> it's<00:04:49.370> what<00:04:49.700> I'm<00:04:49.820> basing<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.300> on

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
can tell it's what I'm basing this on

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.940 
can tell it's what I'm basing this on
because<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.830> same<00:04:52.070> sort<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.490> error<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.950> do

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950

bogey<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.810> each<00:05:17.810> axle<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.590> really<00:05:19.460> long

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
bogey on each axle and the really long

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.960 
bogey on each axle and the really long
and<00:05:20.150> it'd<00:05:20.270> take<00:05:20.450> forever<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.890> unscrew<00:05:22.730> and

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
and it'd take forever to unscrew and

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.760 
and it'd take forever to unscrew and
here's<00:05:23.540> another<00:05:23.660> bit<00:05:23.990> which<00:05:24.200> has<00:05:24.380> just<00:05:24.410> become

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
here's another bit which has just become

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.340 
here's another bit which has just become
apparent<00:05:25.220> right<00:05:25.760> now<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.030> underbody<00:05:29.900> the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
apparent right now the the underbody the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.300 
apparent right now the the underbody the
underbody<00:05:30.770> detail<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:31.730> fine<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.510> delicate

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
underbody detail is so fine and delicate

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.930 
underbody detail is so fine and delicate
that<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.820> would<00:05:35.270> really<00:05:35.840> not<00:05:35.960> be<00:05:36.110> hard<00:05:36.290> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
that is it would really not be hard to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.570 
that is it would really not be hard to
snap<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:37.970> off<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.860> bogies<00:05:40.310> look<00:05:40.520> a

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
snap that off and the the bogies look a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.260 
snap that off and the the bogies look a
bit<00:05:40.760> plasticky<00:05:41.690> as<00:05:42.200> well<00:05:42.820> in<00:05:43.820> terms<00:05:43.880> of

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
bit plasticky as well in terms of

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.770 
bit plasticky as well in terms of
performance<00:05:44.450> is<00:05:45.050> absolutely<00:05:45.830> phenomenal

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
performance is absolutely phenomenal

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.030 
performance is absolutely phenomenal
doesn't<00:05:47.780> even<00:05:47.870> make<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.110> noise<00:05:48.410> that's<00:05:48.919> how

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
doesn't even make a noise that's how

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.610 
doesn't even make a noise that's how
good<00:05:49.190> this<00:05:49.340> thing<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:51.910> as<00:05:52.910> this<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.870> 50<00:05:54.260> 60

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
good this thing is and as this is 50 60

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.440 
good this thing is and as this is 50 60
59<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.780> we<00:05:57.169> have<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.880> refurbished<00:05:58.880> cam<00:05:59.180> from

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
59 and we have the refurbished cam from

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.080 
59 and we have the refurbished cam from
which<00:05:59.780> means<00:06:00.080> that<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.760> headlights<00:06:01.760> are<00:06:01.970> not

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
which means that the headlights are not

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.640 
which means that the headlights are not
recessed<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:04.040> the<00:06:04.990> it's<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.080> different<00:06:06.200> layout

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
recessed and the it's a different layout

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.040 
recessed and the it's a different layout
to<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.010> grills<00:06:07.280> oh<00:06:07.930> there's<00:06:08.930> another

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
to the grills oh there's another

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.010 
to the grills oh there's another
criticism<00:06:09.590> as<00:06:09.919> well<00:06:10.100> I'm<00:06:10.250> afraid<00:06:10.660> these<00:06:11.660> are

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
criticism as well I'm afraid these are

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.890 
criticism as well I'm afraid these are
plastic<00:06:12.919> handrails<00:06:14.590> more<00:06:15.590> easily<00:06:16.130> bent<00:06:16.430> stuff

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
plastic handrails more easily bent stuff

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.040 
plastic handrails more easily bent stuff
so<00:06:18.490> now<00:06:19.490> what<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:19.730> did<00:06:20.060> say<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.300> does<00:06:20.600> beat<00:06:20.870> the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
so now what I did say it does beat the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.909 
so now what I did say it does beat the
60<00:06:21.640> that<00:06:22.640> was<00:06:22.760> in<00:06:22.910> my<00:06:23.090> opinion<00:06:23.500> it's<00:06:24.500> got<00:06:24.800> the

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
60 that was in my opinion it's got the

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.830 
60 that was in my opinion it's got the
looks<00:06:25.190> of<00:06:25.610> what<00:06:26.360> a<00:06:26.570> 56<00:06:27.230> really<00:06:27.560> should<00:06:27.770> be<00:06:27.979> and

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
looks of what a 56 really should be and

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.060 
looks of what a 56 really should be and
if<00:06:29.840> this<00:06:30.110> is<00:06:30.169> anything<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.800> go<00:06:30.830> by

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
if this is anything to go by

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.740 
if this is anything to go by
and<00:06:32.190> I'm<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:32.850> looking<00:06:33.180> forward<00:06:33.390> to

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
and I'm really looking forward to
