lab in the blue mountains in Australia

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.709 
lab in the blue mountains in Australia
just<00:00:08.610> wanted<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> talk<00:00:09.240> quickly<00:00:09.510> about

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
just wanted to talk quickly about

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.510 
just wanted to talk quickly about
calling<00:00:10.380> ropes<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.920> know<00:00:10.980> there's<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> lot<00:00:11.400> of

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
calling ropes I know there's a lot of

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.799 
calling ropes I know there's a lot of
different<00:00:11.789> ways<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> doing<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:12.600> here's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
different ways of doing it but here's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.379 
different ways of doing it but here's
just<00:00:13.020> one<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.379> I<00:00:13.440> find<00:00:13.619> really<00:00:13.889> useful

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
just one that I find really useful

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.520 
just one that I find really useful
thanks<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.510> quicker<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.869> easier<00:00:15.959> too<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
thanks it quicker and easier too if I

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.040 
thanks it quicker and easier too if I
start<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.190> ends<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.730> rope<00:00:18.050> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
start with the two ends of my rope the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.020 
start with the two ends of my rope the
first<00:00:19.350> thing<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.640> make

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
first thing I'm going to do is make

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.010 
first thing I'm going to do is make
those<00:00:21.300> two<00:00:21.600> ends<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.200> good<00:00:23.040> arm<00:00:23.490> span<00:00:23.910> long<00:00:24.270> and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
those two ends a good arm span long and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.930 
those two ends a good arm span long and
that<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.560> while<00:00:25.800> I'm<00:00:25.920> taking<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.490> rest<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.820> my

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
that way while I'm taking the rest of my

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.570 
that way while I'm taking the rest of my
butterfly<00:00:27.570> coil<00:00:28.020> alternating<00:00:28.860> from<00:00:29.040> one<00:00:29.220> side

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
butterfly coil alternating from one side

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
butterfly coil alternating from one side
to<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.940> you<00:00:30.930> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.350> those<00:00:31.530> two

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to the other you can see that those two

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.760 
to the other you can see that those two
ends<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.430> stayed<00:00:32.730> free<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.539> loops<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
ends have stayed free of these loops so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.899 
ends have stayed free of these loops so
there's<00:00:34.950> no<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.250> they're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> pass

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
there's no way they're going to pass

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.250 
there's no way they're going to pass
through<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.359> of<00:00:36.420> those<00:00:36.659> loops<00:00:36.929> which<00:00:37.109> will

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
through one of those loops which will

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
through one of those loops which will
give<00:00:37.379> me<00:00:37.499> a<00:00:37.530> tangle<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.179> then<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
give me a tangle when I'm then and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
give me a tangle when I'm then and
calling<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.260> rope<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> continue<00:00:41.249> with<00:00:41.339> my

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
calling my rope so continue with my

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.720 
calling my rope so continue with my
butterfly<00:00:41.940> coil<00:00:42.769> taking<00:00:43.769> nice<00:00:44.069> full<00:00:44.429> arm

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
butterfly coil taking nice full arm

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.479 
butterfly coil taking nice full arm
lengths<00:00:45.179> each<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.920> alternating<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.280> left

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
lengths each time alternating my left

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.919 
lengths each time alternating my left
and<00:00:47.699> right<00:00:47.850> sides<00:00:48.239> you'll<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.809> I'm

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
and right sides you'll see that I'm

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.819 
and right sides you'll see that I'm
effectively<00:00:49.409> folding<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.149> rope<00:00:51.359> here<00:00:51.829> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
effectively folding up the rope here so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.219 
effectively folding up the rope here so
nice<00:00:53.219> clear<00:00:53.729> loops<00:00:56.210> working<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.479> way<00:00:57.510> towards

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
nice clear loops working my way towards

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
nice clear loops working my way towards
the<00:00:58.319> middle<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.889> rope<00:00:59.069> and<00:01:04.489> then<00:01:05.489> I've<00:01:05.729> got

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the middle of the rope and then I've got

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
the middle of the rope and then I've got
the<00:01:06.000> middle<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.479> rope<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.310> probably

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the middle of my rope here now probably

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
the middle of my rope here now probably
just<00:01:08.550> want<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.730> take<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.600> than

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
just want to take a little bit more than

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
just want to take a little bit more than
that<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:09.960> I'll<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.290> pull<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.980> last

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that so I'll just pull some of this last

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.530 
that so I'll just pull some of this last
tape<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.740> keeping<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.860> firm<00:01:14.160> hold<00:01:14.550> I'm

tape out and keeping a firm hold I'm
then<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> put<00:01:16.260> some<00:01:16.530> wrapping<00:01:17.250> turns

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
then going to put some wrapping turns

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.780 
then going to put some wrapping turns
around<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.960> middle<00:01:19.230> of<00:01:19.260> this<00:01:19.440> coil<00:01:19.800> working

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
around the middle of this coil working

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.430 
around the middle of this coil working
my<00:01:20.940> way<00:01:20.970> back<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.630> towards<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.080> when

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
my way back up towards the top and when

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.660 
my way back up towards the top and when
I've<00:01:25.560> got<00:01:26.540> about<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:28.140> left<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:28.830> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I've got about this much left in the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
I've got about this much left in the
middle<00:01:29.940> I'm<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> pull<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
middle I'm going to pull that all the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.750 
middle I'm going to pull that all the
way<00:01:31.110> through<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.770> top<00:01:32.070> Bight<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.520> last

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
way through this top Bight and the last

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.910 
way through this top Bight and the last
bit<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.120> take<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.450> middle<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.470> pass<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bit is take that middle and pass it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.060 
bit is take that middle and pass it
through<00:01:38.190> there<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:39.480> I've<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> nice<00:01:40.110> secure

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
through there now I've got a nice secure

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
through there now I've got a nice secure
coil<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> rope<00:01:42.290> ready<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.500> deploying<00:01:45.170> now

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
coil of rope ready for deploying now

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.430 
coil of rope ready for deploying now
when<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.410> comes<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> uncoiling<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.870> nice<00:01:48.870> coil

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
when it comes to uncoiling a nice coil

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.060 
when it comes to uncoiling a nice coil
of<00:01:49.650> rope<00:01:50.090> always<00:01:51.090> keep<00:01:51.300> track<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.950> way

of rope always keep track of the way

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460 
of rope always keep track of the way
it's<00:01:53.280> been<00:01:53.520> coiled<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.720> I'll<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.990> my<00:01:55.140> hand

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it's been coiled so I'll put my hand

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.960 
it's been coiled so I'll put my hand
through<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:55.920> before<00:01:56.370> I've<00:01:56.520> started<00:01:56.760> to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
through there before I've started to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.280 
through there before I've started to
unlock<00:01:57.360> these<00:01:57.570> frapping<00:01:58.170> turns<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.330> now<00:02:01.140> I've

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
unlock these frapping turns and now I've

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
unlock these frapping turns and now I've
got<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.650> middle<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.010> my<00:02:02.159> rope<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:03.090> where

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
got the middle of my rope I know where

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.980 
got the middle of my rope I know where
that<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.900> I've<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.470> my<00:02:04.650> two<00:02:04.710> ends<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.640> well

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that is and I've got my two ends as well

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.509 
that is and I've got my two ends as well
now<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.230> want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.470> use<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.830> rope<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.039> one

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
now if I want to use the rope from one

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.330 
now if I want to use the rope from one
end<00:02:09.259> rather<00:02:10.259> than<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.739> throwing<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
end rather than just throwing it on the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.510 
end rather than just throwing it on the
ground<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> big<00:02:11.970> mess<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.950> look<00:02:13.950> at<00:02:14.100> these<00:02:14.460> two

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
ground in a big mess I look at these two

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280 
ground in a big mess I look at these two
ends<00:02:14.910> coming<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.480> side<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:15.990> set<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
ends coming at this side of this set of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.480 
ends coming at this side of this set of
coil<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
coil so I'm going to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.450 
coil so I'm going to
and<00:02:17.580> fold<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:19.530> lie<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.860> neatly<00:02:20.190> on

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
and fold that and then lie it neatly on

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.860 
and fold that and then lie it neatly on
the<00:02:20.580> ground<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.030> I've<00:02:24.150> got<00:02:24.300> my<00:02:24.330> two<00:02:24.510> ends

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the ground so then I've got my two ends

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.300 
the ground so then I've got my two ends
free<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.410> should<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.130> able<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
free and I should then just be able to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
free and I should then just be able to
palm<00:02:26.610> straight<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:28.580> pit<00:02:29.580> fold<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.090> rope

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
palm straight off that pit fold of rope

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.210 
palm straight off that pit fold of rope
and<00:02:30.960> I'll<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.260> no<00:02:31.410> tangles<00:02:31.890> anywhere

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and I'll have no tangles anywhere

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.490 
and I'll have no tangles anywhere
through
