00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
we know it can be tempting to swap and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.770 
we know it can be tempting to swap and
dried<00:00:08.490> herbs<00:00:08.910> when<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> recipe<00:00:09.300> calls<00:00:09.690> for

bunches of fresh herbs from the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400 
bunches of fresh herbs from the
supermarket<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.660> decided<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> look<00:00:16.199> into

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
supermarket so we decided to look into

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.990 
supermarket so we decided to look into
the<00:00:16.500> matter<00:00:16.650> more<00:00:16.920> thoroughly<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.580> wanted<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the matter more thoroughly I wanted to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.460 
the matter more thoroughly I wanted to
find<00:00:18.150> out<00:00:18.300> when<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> swap<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.320> be

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
find out when the swap would really be

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.269 
find out when the swap would really be
acceptable

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
acceptable

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.160

so<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.910> purchased<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> lot<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.660> different<00:00:22.080> herbs

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so we purchased a lot of different herbs

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
so we purchased a lot of different herbs
both<00:00:22.500> fresh<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.830> dried<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.119> basil

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
both fresh and dried we got basil

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.220
