on<00:00:00.269> most<00:00:01.260> icky<00:00:01.500> craft<00:00:01.829> locos<00:00:02.220> there<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.610> plenty

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
on most icky craft locos there is plenty

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.200 
on most icky craft locos there is plenty
of<00:00:03.179> room<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.470> chimney<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.730> nice<00:00:05.970> big

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
of room in the chimney it's a nice big

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.730 
of room in the chimney it's a nice big
chimney<00:00:06.600> there<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.820> so<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.170> fx-control

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
chimney there and so here the fx-control

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.150 
chimney there and so here the fx-control
has<00:00:11.340> been<00:00:11.580> fitted<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.980> question

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
has been fitted and it's just a question

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.859 
has been fitted and it's just a question
of<00:00:15.680> lining<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> big<00:00:18.300> hole<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:20.869> get

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
of lining up the big hole like that get

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
of lining up the big hole like that get
a<00:00:21.900> piece<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> wire<00:00:22.500> simple<00:00:23.130> bit<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> wire<00:00:23.490> can

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a piece of wire simple bit of wire can

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.470 
a piece of wire simple bit of wire can
be<00:00:23.789> anything<00:00:24.380> drop<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> chimney<00:00:26.480> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
be anything drop it down the chimney so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800 
be anything drop it down the chimney so
that<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:28.250> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.429> use<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> wire<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.240> aim<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
that it you can use the wire to aim it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.010 
that it you can use the wire to aim it
at<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.949> hole<00:00:32.750> there<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.870> are

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
at the the hole there we are

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.100 
at the the hole there we are
and<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.850> wire<00:00:36.030> does<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and now what that the wire does is it

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.150 
and now what that the wire does is it
allows<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.770> use<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> screwdriver<00:00:39.450> slot

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
allows you to use the screwdriver slot

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
allows you to use the screwdriver slot
in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.879> top<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.649> chuffer<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.980> gently

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
in the top of the chuffer to just gently

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
in the top of the chuffer to just gently
screw<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> Omega<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.239> careful<00:00:48.660> with

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
screw it Omega be really careful with

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.029 
screw it Omega be really careful with
these<00:00:48.960> things<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.320> gently<00:00:52.620> screw

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
these things that you just gently screw

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
these things that you just gently screw
it<00:00:53.100> home<00:00:54.199> like<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> I'll<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.859> pull

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it home like that so that I'll now pull

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
it home like that so that I'll now pull
the<00:00:59.250> wire<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.649> now<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:03.290> adjust<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the wire out and now you can adjust the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
the wire out and now you can adjust the
chuffa<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> note<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> exactly<00:01:06.869> where<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
chuffa make a note of exactly where the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.170 
chuffa make a note of exactly where the
hole<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.530> obviously<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:09.140> here<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.470> see

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
hole is obviously and here we can see

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
hole is obviously and here we can see
you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.580> hope<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.530> adjust<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you can see I hope that I can adjust it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.289 
you can see I hope that I can adjust it
again<00:01:18.920> always<00:01:19.920> turn<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> clockwise<00:01:20.369> obviously

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
again always turn it clockwise obviously

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
again always turn it clockwise obviously
because<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> screwing<00:01:22.439> device<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
because this is a screwing device so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
because this is a screwing device so
there's<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.930> slightest<00:01:25.409> chance<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's just the slightest chance that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's just the slightest chance that
if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> turn<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> anti-clockwise<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.570> might

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
if you turn it anti-clockwise you might

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.010 
if you turn it anti-clockwise you might
unscrew<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.740> one's<00:01:28.950> quite<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.250> stiff

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
unscrew it but this one's quite a stiff

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310 
unscrew it but this one's quite a stiff
thread<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.950> fits<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.320> now

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
thread so it fits in like that and now

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.999 
thread so it fits in like that and now
we<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:35.150> adjustable<00:01:36.290> chuffa<00:01:37.320> with

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
we have an adjustable chuffa with

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.140 
we have an adjustable chuffa with
fx-control<00:01:38.960> okay<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> rageth<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
fx-control okay so here is rageth with a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.469 
fx-control okay so here is rageth with a
switch<00:01:43.079> 16<00:01:43.560> aligned<00:01:43.979> body<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.390> I've

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
switch 16 aligned body on it and I've

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
switch 16 aligned body on it and I've
just<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.170> 40<00:01:46.649> pounds<00:01:46.920> per

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
just got it up to about 40 pounds per

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
just got it up to about 40 pounds per
square<00:01:47.040> inch<00:01:47.310> I've<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.820> both<00:01:48.390> holes<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
square inch I've got both holes on the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.120 
square inch I've got both holes on the
fx-control<00:01:49.439> closed

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
fx-control closed

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
fx-control closed
and<00:01:51.430> I'm<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:52.299> going<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.830> these<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.280> know

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and I'm just going to these out you know

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.700 
and I'm just going to these out you know
to<00:01:56.470> clear<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.979> condensation<00:01:57.790> as<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.210> see

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to clear the condensation as you can see

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.390 
to clear the condensation as you can see
quite<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> lot<00:01:59.950> coming<00:02:00.190> out<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.950> goes<00:02:03.130> forward

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
quite a lot coming out that goes forward

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.680 
quite a lot coming out that goes forward
again

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.570 

this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.590> normal<00:02:07.890> thing<00:02:08.130> but<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.430> means

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this is the normal thing but it means

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.720 
this is the normal thing but it means
that<00:02:08.760> all<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.570> isn't<00:02:09.990> sperate<00:02:10.650> everywhere

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:29.670 

so<00:02:17.730> that's<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.090> normal<00:02:18.270> sound

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280 

you<00:02:30.099> can<00:02:30.280> see<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:30.610> Plata<00:02:31.090> step<00:02:31.989> between<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
you can see this Plata step between the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.479 
you can see this Plata step between the
two<00:02:32.530> again

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.180 

that's<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.269> small<00:02:39.540> hole

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
that's the small hole

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:53.580 
that's the small hole
more<00:02:41.820> spirits<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.750> consume

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.949 

use<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> burner<00:02:54.520> back<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.850> bit<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.780> can

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
use the burner back a bit see you can

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.800 
use the burner back a bit see you can
see<00:02:59.520> did<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.550> get<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> nice<00:03:00.970> steam<00:03:01.240> effect<00:03:01.569> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
see did you get a nice steam effect and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
see did you get a nice steam effect and
not<00:03:02.650> too<00:03:02.890> much<00:03:03.100> sound<00:03:05.459> okay<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:06.520> that's<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
not too much sound okay so that's the
