another<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:26.109> piece<00:00:26.410> theory<00:00:27.220> review<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.059> this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
another one piece theory review and this

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.580 
another one piece theory review and this
time<00:00:28.359> around<00:00:28.509> we<00:00:28.689> have<00:00:28.809> a<00:00:28.869> really<00:00:29.140> good<00:00:29.380> one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
time around we have a really good one

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.080 
time around we have a really good one
but<00:00:29.980> for<00:00:30.160> anybody<00:00:30.340> doesn't<00:00:30.730> know<00:00:30.849> what<00:00:31.000> this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
but for anybody doesn't know what this

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.210 
but for anybody doesn't know what this
segment<00:00:31.509> is<00:00:31.689> essentially<00:00:32.559> I<00:00:32.590> take<00:00:32.829> one<00:00:33.040> piece

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
segment is essentially I take one piece

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.399 
segment is essentially I take one piece
theories<00:00:33.699> I<00:00:33.879> discuss<00:00:34.540> them<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.900> break<00:00:35.199> them

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
theories I discuss them I break them

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:36.750 
theories I discuss them I break them
down<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.829> at<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:35.980> end<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.159> the<00:00:36.250> video<00:00:36.519> I<00:00:36.579> give

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
down and at the end of the video I give

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.640 
down and at the end of the video I give
a<00:00:36.820> numeric<00:00:37.210> value<00:00:37.329> from<00:00:37.690> one<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.199> ten

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
a numeric value from one to ten

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.380 
a numeric value from one to ten
based<00:00:39.010> on<00:00:39.190> how<00:00:39.400> legitimate<00:00:39.790> I<00:00:40.030> think<00:00:40.239> that

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
based on how legitimate I think that

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.630 
based on how legitimate I think that
these<00:00:40.510> theories<00:00:40.839> are<00:00:41.230> so<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.370> theory<00:00:42.610> that

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
these theories are so the theory that

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.829 
these theories are so the theory that
I'm<00:00:42.760> really<00:00:42.850> breaking<00:00:43.210> down<00:00:43.360> today<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.750> a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
I'm really breaking down today is a

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.139 
I'm really breaking down today is a
theory<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.320> I've<00:00:44.440> actually<00:00:44.680> been<00:00:45.149> promoting

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
theory that I've actually been promoting

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.240 
theory that I've actually been promoting
recently<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.780> just<00:00:47.440> posted<00:00:47.710> about<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:47.949> in<00:00:48.159> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
recently I just posted about it in the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.770 
recently I just posted about it in the
Jay<00:00:48.430> room<00:00:48.610> Facebook<00:00:49.030> group<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.390> it's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
Jay room Facebook group and it's

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.350 
Jay room Facebook group and it's
something<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:51.640> not<00:00:51.790> gonna<00:00:51.939> say<00:00:52.150> I<00:00:52.180> was

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
something that I'm not gonna say I was

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.390 
something that I'm not gonna say I was
the<00:00:52.510> creator<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.049> this<00:00:53.260> idea<00:00:53.650> or<00:00:53.799> this<00:00:53.920> theory

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
the creator of this idea or this theory

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.670 
the creator of this idea or this theory
but<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:55.510> my<00:00:55.629> knowledge<00:00:55.659> nobody<00:00:56.140> else<00:00:56.470> that<00:00:56.650> I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
but to my knowledge nobody else that I

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.950 
but to my knowledge nobody else that I
know<00:00:56.799> or<00:00:57.280> as<00:00:57.580> you'll<00:00:58.030> talk<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.390> me<00:00:58.479> about<00:00:58.570> one

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
know or as you'll talk to me about one

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.469 
know or as you'll talk to me about one
piece<00:00:59.170> has<00:00:59.409> brought<00:00:59.860> this<00:00:59.979> idea<00:01:00.339> up<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:01.119> until

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
piece has brought this idea up so until

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.910 
piece has brought this idea up so until
somebody<00:01:01.750> else<00:01:01.900> claims<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.409> for<00:01:02.559> now

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
somebody else claims it for now

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.219 
somebody else claims it for now
I'll<00:01:03.430> spearhead<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:04.210> theory<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
I'll spearhead this theory and the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.100 
I'll spearhead this theory and the
theory<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.939> xaro's<00:01:06.939> master<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.570> actually

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
theory is that xaro's master is actually

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.469 
theory is that xaro's master is actually
a<00:01:08.189> revolutionary<00:01:09.189> now<00:01:09.670> before<00:01:10.119> we<00:01:10.180> click<00:01:10.329> away

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
a revolutionary now before we click away

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.520 
a revolutionary now before we click away
on<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.750> video<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.140> say<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.409> absolutely

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
on the video and say it's absolutely

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.350 
on the video and say it's absolutely
stupid<00:01:12.100> impossible<00:01:12.640> no<00:01:12.790> way<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.090> how<00:01:13.150> that's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
stupid impossible no way and how that's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.929 
stupid impossible no way and how that's
happening<00:01:13.720> that's<00:01:13.840> stupid<00:01:14.140> let's<00:01:14.829> relax<00:01:15.759> a

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
happening that's stupid let's relax a

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.670 
happening that's stupid let's relax a
little<00:01:16.060> bit<00:01:16.270> take<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.900> look<00:01:17.140> at<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.290> panel

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
little bit take a look at this panel

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.499 
little bit take a look at this panel
because<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.950> panel<00:01:18.310> kind<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.670> started

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
because this panel kind of started

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.300 
because this panel kind of started
getting<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:20.079> ball<00:01:20.259> rolling<00:01:20.290> rolling<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.220> me

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
getting the ball rolling rolling for me

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.099 
getting the ball rolling rolling for me
when<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.549> came<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.240> just<00:01:22.720> look<00:01:23.020> at

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
when it came to this and just look at

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.569 
when it came to this and just look at
the<00:01:23.229> dialogue<00:01:23.649> at<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.890> bottom<00:01:24.219> of<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.369> page

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
the dialogue at the bottom of the page

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:32.140 
the dialogue at the bottom of the page
just<00:01:25.060> take<00:01:25.179> a<00:01:25.210> look

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.720 

now<00:01:32.900> I<00:01:32.930> know<00:01:33.170> what<00:01:33.740> some<00:01:33.770> people<00:01:34.130> are<00:01:34.370> thinking

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
now I know what some people are thinking

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.490 
now I know what some people are thinking
out<00:01:34.910> there<00:01:35.090> I'm<00:01:35.270> gonna<00:01:35.420> say<00:01:35.630> holes<00:01:35.840> are<00:01:36.110> just

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
out there I'm gonna say holes are just

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.260 
out there I'm gonna say holes are just
one<00:01:36.770> speech<00:01:37.100> bubble<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.610> can't<00:01:37.880> base<00:01:38.090> an

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
one speech bubble you can't base an

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.210 
one speech bubble you can't base an
entire<00:01:38.390> theory<00:01:39.020> off<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.290> one<00:01:39.500> speech<00:01:39.800> bubble

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
entire theory off of one speech bubble

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.980 
entire theory off of one speech bubble
and<00:01:40.400> that's<00:01:40.730> not<00:01:40.910> what<00:01:41.120> I'm<00:01:41.240> doing<00:01:41.600> okay<00:01:41.720> there

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
and that's not what I'm doing okay there

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.210 
and that's not what I'm doing okay there
are<00:01:42.080> other<00:01:42.230> things<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.680> want<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.980> talk<00:01:43.070> I'm

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
are other things that I want to talk I'm

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.440 
are other things that I want to talk I'm
gonna<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.460> talking<00:01:43.760> about<00:01:43.880> later<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.300> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
gonna be talking about later on the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.240 
gonna be talking about later on the
video<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.990> kind<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.590> helps<00:01:45.800> support<00:01:46.130> this

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
video that kind of helps support this

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.400 
video that kind of helps support this
idea<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.240> do<00:01:47.450> want<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.840> say<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.290> is

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
idea but I do want to say that it is

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.920 
idea but I do want to say that it is
very<00:01:48.560> interesting<00:01:48.680> though<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.750> dragon<00:01:50.750> for

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
very interesting though that dragon for

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.600 
very interesting though that dragon for
some<00:01:51.110> particular<00:01:51.530> reason<00:01:51.560> decides<00:01:52.310> to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
this important connection as he does to
Zorro<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:32.600> just<00:03:32.810> doesn't<00:03:33.140> add<00:03:33.230> up<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.590> me<00:03:33.739> I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
Zorro it just doesn't add up to me I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.500 
Zorro it just doesn't add up to me I
think<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.459> he<00:03:34.610> would<00:03:34.730> really<00:03:35.000> be<00:03:35.209> someone

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
think that he would really be someone

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.479 
think that he would really be someone
that's<00:03:35.780> truly<00:03:36.110> someone<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.040> feared<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that's truly someone to be feared in the

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.120 
that's truly someone to be feared in the
future<00:03:37.880> not<00:03:38.600> as<00:03:38.750> an<00:03:38.870> enemy<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.230> course<00:03:39.470> but<00:03:40.040> he

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
future not as an enemy of course but he

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.740 
future not as an enemy of course but he
could<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.790> powerful<00:03:41.329> ally<00:03:41.690> if

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
could really be a powerful ally if

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.050 
could really be a powerful ally if
obviously<00:03:42.500> luffy<00:03:42.859> eventually<00:03:43.370> does<00:03:43.609> team<00:03:43.880> up

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
obviously luffy eventually does team up

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.610 
obviously luffy eventually does team up
with<00:03:44.450> his<00:03:44.660> father<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.230> there

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
with his father and there

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.649 
with his father and there
evolutionary's<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:47.239> happens<00:03:47.599> that

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
evolutionary's and it so happens that

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.350 
evolutionary's and it so happens that
Koshiro<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> revolutionary<00:03:49.340> himself<00:03:49.909> how

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
Koshiro is a revolutionary himself how

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.750 
Koshiro is a revolutionary himself how
great<00:03:50.659> a<00:03:50.690> plot<00:03:50.930> twist<00:03:51.110> would<00:03:51.349> that<00:03:51.500> be<00:03:51.709> if<00:03:52.069> it's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
great a plot twist would that be if it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.479 
great a plot twist would that be if it's
Luffy<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.540> his<00:03:53.989> father<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.620> Zorro<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:55.220> his

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
Luffy and his father and Zorro and his

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.789 
Luffy and his father and Zorro and his
master<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:56.420> fighting<00:03:56.840> some<00:03:57.049> people<00:03:57.379> that

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
master like fighting some people that

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.740 
master like fighting some people that
would<00:03:58.040> be<00:03:58.190> excellent<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.120> really<00:03:59.450> as<00:03:59.569> far

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
would be excellent and it really as far

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.600 
would be excellent and it really as far
as<00:03:59.810> I'm<00:03:59.989> concerned<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.860> makes<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.159> lot<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.310> sense

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
as I'm concerned it makes a lot of sense

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.759 
as I'm concerned it makes a lot of sense
now<00:04:02.269> before<00:04:02.659> I<00:04:02.690> go<00:04:02.900> ahead<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.170> actually<00:04:03.620> give

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
now before I go ahead and actually give

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.710 
now before I go ahead and actually give
a<00:04:03.799> rating<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.730> theory<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.150> do<00:04:05.299> want<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.599> go

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
a rating to this theory I do want to go

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.390 
a rating to this theory I do want to go
ahead<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.140> tell<00:04:06.290> all<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> queena<00:04:06.829> fans<00:04:07.159> out

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
ahead and tell all the queena fans out

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.559 
ahead and tell all the queena fans out
there<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.819> all<00:04:07.879> the<00:04:07.940> people<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
there and all the people that have the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.539 
there and all the people that have the
theory<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.959> she's<00:04:09.140> still<00:04:09.319> alive<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:10.159> keep<00:04:10.370> it

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
theory that she's still alive to keep it

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.280 
theory that she's still alive to keep it
to<00:04:10.700> yourself<00:04:11.120> number<00:04:11.360> one<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:11.840> don't<00:04:12.079> think

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
to yourself number one I don't think

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.110 
to yourself number one I don't think
she's<00:04:12.530> alive<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.040> manga<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:13.760> saw<00:04:13.970> her

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
she's alive and the manga we saw her

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.360 
she's alive and the manga we saw her
corpse<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.900> had<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.590> know<00:04:15.680> her<00:04:15.739> face<00:04:15.920> covered

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
corpse it had you know her face covered

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.949 
corpse it had you know her face covered
but<00:04:16.729> we<00:04:16.820> still<00:04:17.030> saw<00:04:17.239> her<00:04:17.359> corpse<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:17.840> I'm

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
but we still saw her corpse so I'm

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.259 
but we still saw her corpse so I'm
really<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.769> mean<00:04:19.250> at<00:04:19.400> first<00:04:19.609> when<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.209> first

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
really I mean at first when I first

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.090 
really I mean at first when I first
thought<00:04:20.690> about<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.199> said<00:04:21.260> maybe<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:21.919> now

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
thought about it I said maybe but now

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.490 
thought about it I said maybe but now
I'm<00:04:22.400> I'm<00:04:23.120> pretty<00:04:23.570> much<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.020> camp<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.470> I

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
I'm I'm pretty much on the camp that I

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.010 
I'm I'm pretty much on the camp that I
think<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:24.949> she's<00:04:25.100> pretty<00:04:25.310> much<00:04:25.510> 100%<00:04:26.510> dead

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
think that she's pretty much 100% dead

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.990 
think that she's pretty much 100% dead
so<00:04:27.889> I'm<00:04:28.010> not<00:04:28.160> gonna<00:04:28.340> go<00:04:28.520> ahead<00:04:28.699> and<00:04:28.850> tackle

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
so I'm not gonna go ahead and tackle

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.879 
so I'm not gonna go ahead and tackle
that<00:04:29.150> theory<00:04:29.630> if<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.810> do<00:04:29.870> that's<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.590> video<00:04:30.740> for

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
that theory if I do that's a video for

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.279 
that theory if I do that's a video for
another<00:04:31.100> day<00:04:31.340> but<00:04:32.000> until<00:04:32.150> then<00:04:32.600> keep<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
another day but until then keep the

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.170 
another day but until then keep the
comments<00:04:33.620> about<00:04:33.919> queena<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.580> yourself<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.060> know

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
comments about queena to yourself I know

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.480 
comments about queena to yourself I know
it's<00:04:35.300> related<00:04:35.720> but<00:04:35.930> hold<00:04:36.830> off<00:04:36.979> on<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.310> guys

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
it's related but hold off on that guys

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.550 
it's related but hold off on that guys
but<00:04:38.060> when<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.300> comes<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.720> actual<00:04:39.110> theory

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
but when it comes to this actual theory

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.920 
but when it comes to this actual theory
and<00:04:39.710> whether<00:04:40.160> or<00:04:40.340> not<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.729> Soros<00:04:41.210> master<00:04:41.780> is

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
and whether or not that Soros master is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.360 
and whether or not that Soros master is
actually<00:04:42.380> revolutionary

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
actually revolutionary

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.159 
actually revolutionary
I<00:04:43.490> know<00:04:43.760> I'm<00:04:44.030> biased<00:04:44.240> when<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:44.690> comes<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.050> this

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
I know I'm biased when it comes to this

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.960 
I know I'm biased when it comes to this
obviously<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.800> is<00:04:45.949> something<00:04:46.789> that<00:04:46.820> I'm

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
obviously this is something that I'm

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.400 
obviously this is something that I'm
spearheading<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.720> one<00:04:47.930> that<00:04:48.050> I'm<00:04:48.199> pushing

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
spearheading it's one that I'm pushing

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.170 
spearheading it's one that I'm pushing
it's<00:04:48.770> it's<00:04:49.070> one<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.520> like<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:49.849> think<00:04:50.060> that

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
it's it's one that I like to think that

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.260 
it's it's one that I like to think that
I<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.840> know<00:04:50.960> had<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.200> hand<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.530> creating<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:52.610> for

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
I you know had a hand in creating so for

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.210 
I you know had a hand in creating so for
me<00:04:53.389> I'm<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.599> bit<00:04:53.870> biased<00:04:54.050> but<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.590> do<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:55.160> that

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
me I'm a bit biased but I do think that

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.740 
me I'm a bit biased but I do think that
this<00:04:55.430> is<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.639> good<00:04:55.849> theory<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:56.389> I'm<00:04:56.450> gonna<00:04:56.539> give

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
this is a good theory so I'm gonna give

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.440 
this is a good theory so I'm gonna give
this<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:57.349> theory<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.860> seven<00:04:58.340> out<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.490> ten<00:04:58.610> good

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
this a theory a seven out of ten good

I<00:05:07.970> know<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.900> give<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.200> rating<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.680> high<00:05:10.010> off

I know to give it a rating that high off

one panel and a lot of speculation

one panel and a lot of speculation
that's<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:13.010> big<00:05:13.190> that's<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.610> big<00:05:13.789> score<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.120> know

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
that's a big that's a big score I know

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.710 
that's a big that's a big score I know
but<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:16.130> just<00:05:16.190> seems<00:05:16.760> like<00:05:16.910> he<00:05:17.090> was<00:05:17.210> he<00:05:17.479> he

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
but it just seems like he was he he

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.300 
but it just seems like he was he he
seems<00:05:17.900> like<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.169> very<00:05:18.260> important<00:05:18.889> character

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
seems like a very important character

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.670 
seems like a very important character
and<00:05:20.180> for<00:05:20.479> him<00:05:20.599> not<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.840> be<00:05:21.080> useful<00:05:21.289> in<00:05:21.560> any

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
and for him not to be useful in any

and for him not to be useful in any

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
respect in the series other than to just

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.360 
respect in the series other than to just
be<00:05:23.389> someone<00:05:24.199> that<00:05:24.229> that's<00:05:24.590> related<00:05:24.919> that<00:05:25.010> is

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
be someone that that's related that is

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.520 
be someone that that's related that is
you<00:05:25.760> know<00:05:25.820> known<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.330> Zorro<00:05:26.599> it<00:05:26.990> just<00:05:27.260> seems

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
you know known to Zorro it just seems

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.260 
you know known to Zorro it just seems
like<00:05:27.650> it's<00:05:27.860> not<00:05:28.070> worthy<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.580> was<00:05:28.789> someone<00:05:29.120> like

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
like it's not worthy of was someone like

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.270 
like it's not worthy of was someone like
that<00:05:29.300> especially<00:05:30.289> considering<00:05:30.740> we<00:05:30.830> know<00:05:31.099> that

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
that especially considering we know that

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.939 
that especially considering we know that
he's<00:05:31.430> strong<00:05:31.789> based<00:05:32.599> on<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:33.139> mr1<00:05:33.590> fighting

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
he's strong based on the mr1 fighting

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.290 
he's strong based on the mr1 fighting
the<00:05:34.010> fact<00:05:34.220> that<00:05:34.340> he<00:05:34.430> knew<00:05:34.550> how<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.669> cut<00:05:35.000> steel

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
the fact that he knew how to cut steel

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.089 
the fact that he knew how to cut steel
so<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> feel<00:05:36.349> like<00:05:36.380> this<00:05:36.590> character<00:05:36.830> is

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
so I feel like this character is

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.680 
so I feel like this character is
obviously<00:05:37.490> connected<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.000> manga<00:05:38.300> panel

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
obviously connected the manga panel

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.230 
obviously connected the manga panel
where<00:05:38.840> they<00:05:38.960> resupplied<00:05:39.560> at<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:40.520> dojo<00:05:40.729> just

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
where they resupplied at the dojo just

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.310 
where they resupplied at the dojo just
makes<00:05:41.479> too<00:05:41.570> much<00:05:41.750> sense<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:42.199> they're

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
makes too much sense that they're

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.570 
makes too much sense that they're
obviously<00:05:42.470> connected<00:05:43.190> in<00:05:43.280> one<00:05:43.400> way<00:05:43.460> or

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
obviously connected in one way or

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.580 
obviously connected in one way or
another<00:05:43.699> some<00:05:44.479> people<00:05:44.780> might<00:05:44.900> say<00:05:45.139> oh<00:05:45.169> they're

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
another some people might say oh they're

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.870 
another some people might say oh they're
just<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:46.039> know<00:05:46.130> connected<00:05:46.580> maybe<00:05:46.699> they're

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
just you know connected maybe they're

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.219 
just you know connected maybe they're
just<00:05:46.910> friends<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.630> he<00:05:47.750> doesn't<00:05:48.050> mean<00:05:48.139> in

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
just friends that he doesn't mean in

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.110 
just friends that he doesn't mean in
this<00:05:48.410> revolutionary<00:05:49.220> but<00:05:49.699> that<00:05:49.910> would<00:05:50.090> be

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
this revolutionary but that would be

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.450 
this revolutionary but that would be
kind<00:05:50.479> of<00:05:50.599> a<00:05:50.720> waste<00:05:50.900> while<00:05:51.590> we<00:05:51.740> already<00:05:52.220> even

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
kind of a waste while we already even

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.060 
kind of a waste while we already even
draw<00:05:52.820> that<00:05:52.970> panel<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.419> begin<00:05:53.750> with<00:05:53.960> if<00:05:54.830> they

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
draw that panel to begin with if they

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.860 
draw that panel to begin with if they
weren't<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:56.000> some<00:05:56.240> kind<00:05:56.419> of<00:05:56.450> important

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
weren't have some kind of important

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.390 
weren't have some kind of important
connection<00:05:57.320> together<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.830> know

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
connection together you know

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.800 
connection together you know
it<00:05:58.820> would<00:05:58.970> be<00:05:59.090> kind<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.389> waste<00:05:59.479> they<00:05:59.720> were

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
it would be kind of a waste they were

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.879 
it would be kind of a waste they were
just<00:05:59.990> friends<00:06:00.380> that<00:06:00.500> would<00:06:00.590> just<00:06:00.740> be

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
just friends that would just be

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.340 
just friends that would just be
pointless<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:01.699> draw<00:06:01.880> that<00:06:02.060> then<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.690> just<00:06:03.169> feel

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
pointless to draw that then I just feel

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.600 
pointless to draw that then I just feel
like<00:06:03.440> there's<00:06:03.650> obviously<00:06:04.100> something<00:06:04.400> there

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
like there's obviously something there

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.570 
like there's obviously something there
and<00:06:05.060> it's<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.350> really<00:06:06.680> opens<00:06:07.190> up<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.400> lot<00:06:07.520> of

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
and it's I really opens up a lot of

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.730 
and it's I really opens up a lot of
opportunities<00:06:08.300> for<00:06:08.330> Zoro's<00:06:08.930> character<00:06:09.530> and

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
opportunities for Zoro's character and

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.370 
opportunities for Zoro's character and
and<00:06:10.010> and<00:06:10.430> him<00:06:10.639> in<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.910> future<00:06:11.300> so<00:06:11.540> I<00:06:11.750> think<00:06:12.290> is

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
and and him in the future so I think is

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.840 
and and him in the future so I think is
this<00:06:12.650> makes<00:06:12.889> a<00:06:12.979> lot<00:06:13.130> of<00:06:13.160> sense<00:06:13.460> but<00:06:13.639> I<00:06:13.699> would

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
this makes a lot of sense but I would

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.430 
this makes a lot of sense but I would
like<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.030> know<00:06:14.120> your<00:06:14.300> guys<00:06:14.449> opinions<00:06:14.660> what<00:06:15.380> do

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
like to know your guys opinions what do

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.750 
like to know your guys opinions what do
you<00:06:15.530> think<00:06:15.740> about<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.010> possibility<00:06:16.729> of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
you think about the possibility of

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.240 
you think about the possibility of
xaro's<00:06:17.030> master<00:06:17.479> being<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.750> revolutionary

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
xaro's master being a revolutionary

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.100 
xaro's master being a revolutionary
having<00:06:19.250> ties<00:06:19.460> with<00:06:19.729> Dragon<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:20.540> on<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:20.900> so

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
having ties with Dragon and so on and so

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.830 
having ties with Dragon and so on and so
forth<00:06:21.410> like<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.400> said<00:06:22.610> before<00:06:23.210> you<00:06:23.510> can<00:06:23.660> rate

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
forth like I said before you can rate

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.200 
forth like I said before you can rate
your<00:06:24.020> own<00:06:24.169> 1<00:06:24.740> out<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:24.919> 10<00:06:25.100> scale<00:06:25.430> as<00:06:25.639> to<00:06:26.030> what

your own 1 out of 10 scale as to what

your own 1 out of 10 scale as to what
how<00:06:26.750> plausible<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.350> think<00:06:27.590> that<00:06:27.710> this<00:06:27.830> theory

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
how plausible you think that this theory
