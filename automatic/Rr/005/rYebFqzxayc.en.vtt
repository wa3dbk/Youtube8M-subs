 put an observation round in all 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.110
 case of 40 between the vanguard of the pack 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.520

 the return of bryan coquard in the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.800
 first places may make it 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.440
 Something 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.990
 bryan coquard who will follow you north doc 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.980
 who will follow maxim iglinskiy who in 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.750
 second advance 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.460
 iglinskiy who are you doggie to see 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.700
 heckled when doc who does not follow anyone 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.950
 cocker who follows glynn ski attention 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.100
 because from has come out cold and 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.630
 outings is what bryan coquard is going 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.230
 we'll have to sprint is here to 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.940
 for vdb for north dog and for queen 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.090
 tana pay attention to who is going to him 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.800
 take the wheel of one will say david 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.140
 millar it's the one on the right he goes 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.140
 must go froome christopher froome 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.400
 who can throw his sprint 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.190
 now watch out for vicenzo nibali and 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.620
 moreno dani moreno on the right side 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.880
 attention forward who knows iacob was that 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.500
 that sense that should win 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.480
 this step unless the rocket 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.160
 that coquettish accor come back cocker who 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.380
 going to do two just behind figure 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.350
 bloody seems to me that in the quarter that was 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.040
 still there he passed the base damage he 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.230
 is maybe 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.610
 he may have started his sprint badly 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.020
 did not have a lot of multiplying 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.450
 worked a lot for van den 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.670
 broeck and grinta have in any case 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.620
 bad guys who does 3 who's going to have to 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.419
 increase notice in advance at the 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.080
 green jersey in any case we will accelerate 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.990
 in 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.780
 will go straight to the podiums of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.150
 this after this third step and 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.349
 mathias frank was dropped too but 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.289
 no problem 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.150
 see the catwalks now with this 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.159
 ja victory like google to 5 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.500
 bryan coquard and thomas voeckler 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.539
 vdb did a good tenth place when 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.289
 even it should be noted it is very close 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.819
 bryan coquard who should still 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.159
 kept his yellow jersey 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.659
 yellow easily keep pu finally 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.259
 easily with difficulty because he has 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.180
 had to hold 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.039
 bryan coquard which therefore increases 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.870
 largely these advanced points on mark 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.490
 cavendish and marcel kittel at the 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.020
 bravo green jersey for bryan bryan and 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.530
 Roman bardet who keeps his 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.289
 beautiful polka dot jersey we know it 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.819
 a and bryan coquettish always with the 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.529
 white jersey that will be worn by google 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.270
 the rising single who tried to 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.069
 leave in the final but it did not 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.830
 not smiled in any case up the stairs 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.080
 always the best team at the level 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.360
 of the three best riders of each 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.270
 team is the stopover as he has 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.759
 that it matters function that wins so 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.710
 this third step and so we do not 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.020
 we will meet again in the next 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.240
 days to see who will win 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.250
 the 4th stage against the clock between 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.449
 nice and nice it will be time for us to 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.180
 to lose as little time as possible 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.060
 while still with the first case 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.500
 cards and vdb which is 10th while a 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.180
 hero queen tannins and 8th for now 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.419
 all our runners are very well placed 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.729
 we always have a stage win 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.020
 with meego the bone me I tell you to the 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.020
