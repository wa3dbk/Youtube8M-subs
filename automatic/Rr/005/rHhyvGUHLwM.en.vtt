00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 try to train correctly 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 initial body position for this their 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.380
 social back against the wall 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.950
 five heeled dots lower back 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.460
 shoulder blades and nape chin is located 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 under 90 degrees relative to the body example 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.190
 the spirit of the direction where the ceiling 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 true 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.320
 belly pulls up top 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 remembered this position away from the wall 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 tried looked like looked at themselves 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 in the mirror, draw the next step in front of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 a straight line 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 heels should follow this straight line 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 socks barely unfolded step should 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 be equal 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.670
 your foot length first go feet in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.380
 in no case is the body the body goes after 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.829
 for on 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.820
 don't go announced you have to go on 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.530
 purpose as if someone pulls you 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 often while walking girls commit 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 various errors are the most common 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.340
 one of them is to walk on bent knees 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.409
 in order to avoid it 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.819
 always remember that the supporting leg 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.880
 always direct the next mistake is when 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.490
 a woman is considered very beautiful 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.099
 flex your back and push your pelvis back 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.750
 from the outside it looks very funny 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.799
 maybe that moment you feel 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.860

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.830
 meets bouncing and gait for 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.500
 In order for this not to be like 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.939
 some time with a book the head should 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.810

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.510
 you need not exaggerate 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.799
 hip slightly pumped to the side 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 does the united states carry the body chief go by 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.350
 heels on one line at the skete a little apart 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.600

 wherever possible but very rarely 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.070
 heel wrapping still occurs 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.560
 after we made a move we 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.610
