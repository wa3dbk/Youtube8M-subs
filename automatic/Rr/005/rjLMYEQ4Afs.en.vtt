00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
giant squirrel I thought that the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.380 
giant squirrel I thought that the
squirrelanoids<00:00:35.520> were<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> again

squirrelanoids were gonna come up again
I<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:37.200> thought<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.800> squirrel

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I really thought that the squirrel

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.950

annoyed<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> made<00:00:39.000> another<00:00:39.270> appearance

this<00:00:44.480> what<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:46.110> thought<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this what I first thought was a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.410 
this what I first thought was a
pheromone<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:49.260> toxin<00:00:50.239> April<00:00:51.239> gets
