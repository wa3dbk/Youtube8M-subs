00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.270 
say there's no students a lack here no
actually<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.820> not<00:02:52.850> um<00:02:53.420> yeah<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:56.260> this

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
actually it's not um yeah it's here this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.470 
actually it's not um yeah it's here this
two<00:02:58.280> buttons<00:02:58.880> here<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.840> can<00:03:00.110> see<00:03:00.350> it's<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:01.480> like

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
two buttons here you can see it's a like

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.010 
two buttons here you can see it's a like
and<00:03:02.690> start<00:03:03.230> well<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:04.480> they<00:03:05.480> put<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.840> there

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
and start well it's they put it there

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.160 
and start well it's they put it there
because<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.560> think<00:03:06.950> withdraw<00:03:07.730> gaming<00:03:08.180> mostly

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
because I think withdraw gaming mostly

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.870 
because I think withdraw gaming mostly
they<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.440> press<00:03:09.860> start<00:03:10.220> at<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.670> first

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
they just press start at the first

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640 
they just press start at the first
screen<00:03:11.240> when<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.720> enter<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.170> game<00:03:12.410> or

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
screen when you enter the game or

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.130 
screen when you enter the game or
something<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.480> probably<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.600> excess<00:03:14.990> of

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
something and probably the excess of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.199 
something and probably the excess of
menu<00:03:15.560> extra<00:03:16.070> manual<00:03:16.520> settings<00:03:16.880> all<00:03:17.090> those

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
menu extra manual settings all those

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.710 
menu extra manual settings all those
stuff<00:03:17.769> nobody<00:03:18.769> uses<00:03:19.250> start<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.000> select<00:03:20.300> for

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
stuff nobody uses start and select for

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.280 
stuff nobody uses start and select for
gaming<00:03:21.470> do<00:03:21.980> they<00:03:22.160> except<00:03:22.970> for<00:03:23.110> important<00:03:24.110> man

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
gaming do they except for important man

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.430 
gaming do they except for important man
use<00:03:24.500> under<00:03:24.890> stuff<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.400> guess<00:03:25.640> or<00:03:25.910> house<00:03:26.570> that's

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
use under stuff I guess or house that's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.490 
use under stuff I guess or house that's
all<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.820> why<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.239> think<00:03:29.720> they<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.260> at

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
all that is why I think they put it at

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.729 
all that is why I think they put it at
so<00:03:31.360> side<00:03:32.709> all<00:03:33.709> right<00:03:35.980> hello<00:03:36.980> again<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:38.180> guess<00:03:38.750> ok

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
so side all right hello again I guess ok

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.759 
so side all right hello again I guess ok
now<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:41.780> want<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.140> talk<00:03:42.320> about<00:03:42.440> some

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
now that we want to talk about some

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.020 
now that we want to talk about some
problems<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.730> game<00:03:44.620> possibly<00:03:45.620> didn't<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
problems in the game possibly didn't the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.970 
problems in the game possibly didn't the
harder<00:03:47.510> probably<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.019> worst<00:03:48.260> problem<00:03:48.800> ever

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
harder probably the worst problem ever

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.600 
harder probably the worst problem ever
but<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.750> not<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.769> significant<00:03:52.459> I

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
but it is not really that significant I

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.050 
but it is not really that significant I
mean<00:03:52.760> yeah<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.590> possible<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.610> be

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
mean yeah you can it is possible to be

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.900 
mean yeah you can it is possible to be
fixed<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> future<00:03:57.230> or<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.489> game's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
fixed in the future or it's the game's

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.360 
fixed in the future or it's the game's
problem<00:03:59.570> i<00:03:59.660> guess<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.739> it's<00:04:00.980> something<00:04:01.340> like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
working well go to map this just very

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.850 
working well go to map this just very
simply<00:05:00.460> because<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.300> one<00:05:01.570> of<00:05:01.600> our<00:05:01.870> game

so minor problem but I just found out

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.720 
so minor problem but I just found out
that<00:06:05.639> actually<00:06:06.380> probably<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.680> game<00:06:08.010> depending

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
that actually probably is game depending

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.230 
that actually probably is game depending
as<00:06:09.300> you<00:06:09.660> see<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:11.040> why<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.880> is<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.030> reason

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
as you see the why this is the reason

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.090 
as you see the why this is the reason
they're<00:06:12.570> saying<00:06:12.840> that<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.230> problem<00:06:13.950> is<00:06:14.070> not

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
they're saying that the problem is not

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.680 
they're saying that the problem is not
really<00:06:14.460> that<00:06:14.490> significant<00:06:15.150> is<00:06:15.240> because<00:06:15.270> I

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
really that significant is because I

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.040 
really that significant is because I

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
I guess there's actually nothing wrong

I guess there's actually nothing wrong
here<00:07:13.350> but<00:07:13.580> yeah<00:07:14.580> this<00:07:14.820> really<00:07:15.060> nothing<00:07:15.780> is
