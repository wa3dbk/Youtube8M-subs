department at University College London
I<00:00:20.670> am<00:00:21.599> researching<00:00:22.349> about<00:00:22.619> cells<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
I am researching about cells and how to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.989 
I am researching about cells and how to
adhere<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.419> surfaces<00:00:24.650> I'm<00:00:25.650> basically<00:00:26.339> at<00:00:26.759> then

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
adhere to surfaces I'm basically at then

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.140 
adhere to surfaces I'm basically at then
the<00:00:27.330> base<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> PDMS<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.490> need<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:29.880> mix<00:00:29.999> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the base for the PDMS I need to mix it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
the base for the PDMS I need to mix it
together<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.539> form<00:00:30.869> air<00:00:31.050> bubbles<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:32.009> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
together to form air bubbles this is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.550 
together to form air bubbles this is
because<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.270> put<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.960> degassing

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
because when we put in the degassing

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.380 
because when we put in the degassing
machine<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.220> air<00:00:35.460> bubbles<00:00:35.760> will<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
machine the air bubbles will go down and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.479 
machine the air bubbles will go down and
make<00:00:36.539> it<00:00:36.750> homogeneous<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.770> flat

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
make it homogeneous and flat

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.189 
make it homogeneous and flat
yeah<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:40.809> even<00:00:41.320> our<00:00:41.920> classy<00:00:42.579> with<00:00:42.730> Alex<00:00:43.199> he

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
yeah but even our classy with Alex he

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.380 
yeah but even our classy with Alex he
has<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.739> he<00:00:45.040> does<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.430> big-picture<00:00:45.610> stuff<00:00:45.969> but

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
has to he does the big-picture stuff but

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.630 
has to he does the big-picture stuff but
I<00:00:46.420> just<00:00:46.480> I'm<00:00:47.199> just<00:00:47.500> doing<00:00:48.100> one<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.430> little

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
I just I'm just doing one of the little

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.670 
I just I'm just doing one of the little
things<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.910> he<00:00:49.149> doesn't<00:00:49.329> have<00:00:49.540> time<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:50.170> in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
things that he doesn't have time to in

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.799 
things that he doesn't have time to in
less<00:00:50.890> than<00:00:51.040> this<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.910> degausser<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.510> his<00:00:52.600> face

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
less than this the degausser in his face

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.750 
less than this the degausser in his face
that<00:00:52.960> he<00:00:53.140> he<00:00:53.590> got<00:00:53.739> some<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> PDMS<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.670> I'm

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
that he he got some the PDMS and I'm

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.439 
that he he got some the PDMS and I'm
just<00:00:55.050> everytime<00:00:56.050> bubbles<00:00:56.500> come<00:00:56.680> up<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:56.949> have<00:00:57.129> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
just everytime bubbles come up I have to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.600 
just everytime bubbles come up I have to
open<00:00:58.449> this<00:00:58.809> valve<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.260> little<00:00:59.290> bit<00:00:59.620> so<00:01:00.010> air<00:01:00.370> can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
open this valve a little bit so air can

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.000 
open this valve a little bit so air can
come<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.210> bubbles<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.720> go<00:01:02.229> down<00:01:02.440> but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
come in and the bubbles can go down but

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.910 
come in and the bubbles can go down but
when<00:01:03.159> I<00:01:03.430> came<00:01:03.909> for<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> induction<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.989> did

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
when I came for the induction I did

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.040 
when I came for the induction I did
think<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.369> maybe<00:01:06.850> stuff<00:01:07.570> they'll<00:01:07.750> be<00:01:07.899> doing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
think that maybe stuff they'll be doing

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.830 
think that maybe stuff they'll be doing
in<00:01:08.259> uni<00:01:08.619> is<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.740> bit<00:01:09.130> too<00:01:09.550> advanced<00:01:10.210> for<00:01:10.360> me<00:01:10.630> or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
in uni is a bit too advanced for me or

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.900 
in uni is a bit too advanced for me or
for<00:01:10.869> my<00:01:11.140> level<00:01:11.350> but<00:01:11.890> when<00:01:12.039> you<00:01:12.220> actually<00:01:12.490> get

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
for my level but when you actually get

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.389 
for my level but when you actually get
here<00:01:12.940> they<00:01:13.840> make<00:01:14.140> sure<00:01:14.320> you're<00:01:14.860> capable<00:01:15.009> of

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
here they make sure you're capable of

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.620 
here they make sure you're capable of
actually<00:01:15.520> carrying<00:01:15.880> out<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.210> project<00:01:16.360> cuz

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
actually carrying out the project cuz

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.910 
actually carrying out the project cuz
they<00:01:16.780> won't<00:01:16.929> give<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.200> something<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.649> can't

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
they won't give you something you can't

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.320 
they won't give you something you can't
do<00:01:18.899> my<00:01:19.899> name<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.289> Ian<00:01:20.530> lund<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.950> I'm<00:01:21.280> from<00:01:21.940> Kew

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
do my name is Ian lund and I'm from Kew

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.200 
do my name is Ian lund and I'm from Kew
boys<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:23.110> what<00:01:23.679> I've<00:01:23.800> been<00:01:23.979> doing<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.490> UCL<00:01:24.940> is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
boys and what I've been doing in UCL is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.320 
boys and what I've been doing in UCL is
working<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.050> how<00:01:26.800> bacteria<00:01:27.670> would<00:01:27.880> adhere<00:01:28.090> to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
working on how bacteria would adhere to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.990 
working on how bacteria would adhere to
the<00:01:28.539> surface<00:01:28.869> of<00:01:29.289> polycarbonate<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.610> it's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
the surface of polycarbonate and it's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.330 
the surface of polycarbonate and it's
very<00:01:31.179> similar<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.929> phase<00:01:32.170> project<00:01:32.860> but

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
very similar to a phase project but

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.249 
very similar to a phase project but
instead<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.759> using<00:01:34.000> bacteria<00:01:34.659> she's<00:01:35.050> using

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
instead of using bacteria she's using

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.090 
instead of using bacteria she's using
cells<00:01:35.679> so<00:01:36.100> at<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.610> moment<00:01:37.060> I'm<00:01:37.330> trying<00:01:37.390> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
cells so at the moment I'm trying to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.410 
cells so at the moment I'm trying to
plasma<00:01:39.100> treat<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> polycarbonate

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
plasma treat the polycarbonate

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.600 
plasma treat the polycarbonate
and<00:01:40.569> what<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:41.440> need<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.710> do<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.429> need<00:01:42.550> to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
and what you need to do is you need to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.640 
and what you need to do is you need to
get<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.119> conditions<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.869> perfect<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.409> it

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
get the conditions just perfect for it

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.410 
get the conditions just perfect for it
hey<00:01:46.190> this<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.820> piece<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.090> polycarbonate

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
hey this is a piece of polycarbonate

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.470 
hey this is a piece of polycarbonate
which<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.200> have<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.530> plasma<00:01:49.280> treated<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:50.240> is

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
which I have just plasma treated this is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.550 
which I have just plasma treated this is
quite<00:01:50.690> hard<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> understand<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
quite hard to understand at the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.130 
quite hard to understand at the
beginning<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.280> as<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:53.030> read<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:53.630> journals

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
beginning but as you read for journals

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.320 
beginning but as you read for journals
and<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.530> understand<00:01:55.460> more<00:01:55.790> about<00:01:55.850> what's

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
and and understand more about what's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.170 
and and understand more about what's
happening<00:01:56.420> is<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.770> get<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.130> learn<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.970> lot<00:01:59.120> of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
happening is you get to learn a lot of

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.010 
happening is you get to learn a lot of
stuff<00:01:59.570> I<00:02:00.080> am<00:02:01.040> considering<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.850> do<00:02:02.020> engineering

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
stuff I am considering to do engineering

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.320 
stuff I am considering to do engineering
not<00:02:03.650> biochemical<00:02:04.370> but<00:02:04.490> Chemical<00:02:04.910> Engineering

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
not biochemical but Chemical Engineering

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.950 
not biochemical but Chemical Engineering
I<00:02:05.720> thought<00:02:06.410> before<00:02:06.680> my<00:02:07.780> idea<00:02:08.780> about

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
I thought before my idea about

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.600 
I thought before my idea about
engineering<00:02:09.380> was<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.830> know<00:02:09.979> tools

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
engineering was you know tools

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.670 
engineering was you know tools
everywhere<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.360> didn't<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:11.900> what<00:02:12.050> made<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
everywhere and didn't know what made the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.700 
everywhere and didn't know what made the
tools<00:02:12.950> were<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.310> all<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:15.380> has

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
tools were and all of that this has

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.370 
tools were and all of that this has
really<00:02:16.070> allowed<00:02:16.640> me<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.060> experience<00:02:17.930> what

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
really allowed me to experience what

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.970 
really allowed me to experience what
engineering<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.430> really<00:02:19.670> about
