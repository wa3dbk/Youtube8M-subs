00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.780
 A little try because it is here now very strong key light is hitting 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.840
 It's like you're simulating 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.580
 And now this one is in a state of being inserted into the outlet 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.989
 Now here's a 500 watt light too bright How to darken this and what to do 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.480
 There are many things to say but there are about three ways at this time 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.220
 Proposal 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.420
 It makes first diffuse as a technique of ways, such as a conventional photo 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.260
 It reduces the amount by diffusing light in various ways. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.690
 There is such a diffusion filter 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.620
 This one is made of heat resistance so it's very resistant to heat, so it seems like something hot near you 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.129
 not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.609
 So please use something like this If you use paper this will burn out 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.989
 Be sure to use heat resistance as it will be a bit dangerous 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:58.890
 It's this very tight guy now , what will happen if you spread it 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 Let's take a look at Ugh 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.890
 It feels like this , and at the same time it becomes soft 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 The brightness has fallen a little 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.260
 But even if it is too bright , there are also two or three steps . 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.409
 It's better to earn distance as an easy-to-understand method 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.409
 Naturally the brightness will be dark if you talk 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.020
 Now when the aperture of the camera doesn't change, the lightness of the diver fell when it was this 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.890
 I think it is not 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.340
 So when the distance can take talking about taking the distance at the time of light in this way too bright 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.409
 Give 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:45.700
 This is a fairly straightforward solution, and also this kind of big spread 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.700
 twitter There is something 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.310
 It is such a guy 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.340
 There may be people who have seen it at film shooting sites , but it looks like this 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.509
 Ne 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.509
 It spreads in a good feeling even if it is getting very close by this 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.410
 It is such a state 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.160
 If this is too strong, it will be more likely to hold the filter 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.640
 In the way 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.780
 Way there is that going to weaken a two-stage three-stage 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.780
 Please give to feel like better just it is in this kind of Fu because 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:41.280
 By the way, this is n't the case with spotlights just like now , but with outdoor locations 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 There is also will be used this thought in so that from above it when the sun light stars are severe 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.430
 Also way that anything after is to be reflected once said that fuse when it is in addition to the diffusion 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.569
 Though there is 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.569
 I would like to try it a bit at another time
