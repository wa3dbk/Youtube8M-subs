one<00:00:55.410> does<00:00:55.800> better<00:00:56.160> sculpture<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.840> better

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
one does better sculpture in better

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
one does better sculpture in better
shape<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> head<00:00:59.420> but<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> also

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shape of the head but this one is also

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
shape of the head but this one is also
pretty<00:01:03.180> decent<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:08.520> got

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
