00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
whether this could be released as a

whether this could be released as a
mobile<00:02:43.230> app<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> mobile<00:02:43.920> game<00:02:44.220> then<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
mobile app and a mobile game then I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120 
mobile app and a mobile game then I
would<00:02:45.510> say<00:02:45.780> yes<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.950> very

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
would say yes I think this is very

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.010 
would say yes I think this is very
likely<00:02:47.400> chance<00:02:47.760> Rockstar<00:02:48.270> Games<00:02:48.420> would<00:02:48.780> want

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
likely chance Rockstar Games would want

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.630 
likely chance Rockstar Games would want
to<00:02:49.170> take<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.590> even<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.100> they<00:02:50.190> decided<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
to take and even if they decided to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.520 
to take and even if they decided to
shrink<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.060> map<00:02:51.239> up<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> fit<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> mobile

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
shrink the map up so it fit on a mobile

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.290 
shrink the map up so it fit on a mobile
phone<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.519> could<00:02:53.640> easily<00:02:53.820> add<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.660 
phone I think they could easily add the
city<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.720> Los<00:02:54.930> Santos<00:02:55.110> into<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> mobile<00:02:56.190> version
