00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.150
 here we are 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.149
 many have asked me for details 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.720
 regarding this dynamic theme the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 so now I will show you the circuit briefly and also the fact that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 dumps produced this type jeep pearl obinna can be touched 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.100
 even if they hurt they are not mortal because 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.019
 they have a higher frequency 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.140
 internapoli and large 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.479
 so let's say lol comments are more bearable 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.550
 now let's briefly deal with electric scooters 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.170
 we have from india to 220 volts because it enters 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.450
 with phase and neutral of our hope it you remember me ex-smoker 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.480
 which heywire used to light ignite the diesel in the old ones 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.290
 oil-fired boilers 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.890
 we have 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.380
 - tricks come into the targets succeed at high voltage via e 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.560
 mass a piece of land 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 and the contractor connection 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.520
 from here c6000 generated times enter 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.030
 the group with paid in this case. small because it is a small one 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.320
 home 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.479
 the capacitors once charged enough amnesia to catch the trap 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.760
 the split in this case 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.710
 it's improvised 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.410
 I understood interrupted 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.760
 when the energy stored in the capacitors will be sufficient 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 ana jump this cat across the square 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.370
 energy transmits Rome to us 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.740
 on my primary turning which are these coils of red thread 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.230
 this happens 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.410
 the primary transmitting energy a frequency that depends 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610
 hi capacity in the group connected to turin 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 from the number of turns of the primary then from its inductance 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.680
 these two values 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.940
 coupled with group command of the five generate the frequency with which it is 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.780
 also tuned our non secondary hot boby 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 remember that this depends on the number of turns 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.749
 this case on many 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.889
 it is from a possible incapacity on the head of the reel 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.889
 you can put as no the important thing is that 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:26.219
 in any case, the frequency of the primary is a 4 second quote comparison 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:26.829
 dress 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.949
 once i posted you energy experiment 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.459
 we will have our high voltage discharges such as wet outgoing this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.899
 case you see little 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.359
 We immediately try the system as I said if I am a woman feeding you will see it 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.569
 arrester activates 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.569
 and the shocks succeeded 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.389
 but 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.359
 they hurt 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.059
 sky 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.919
 so nicole simply that the most important thing is air 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.579
 kalibra the capacitor group 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.619
 according 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.409
 to the output current of the high voltage generator in this case 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.579
 ventimiglia for 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.060
 and consequently 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 to test how many turns are needed to tune the whole system 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.810
 with possible secondary if you have already prepared it otherwise you can build 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.969
 directly to second hand according to the parameters 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.439
 dr1 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.449
 and c1 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.499
 simply 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.639
 thank you very much for all the writers who follow me on my site 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.939
 and for your comments 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.489
 the next
