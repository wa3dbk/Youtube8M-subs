00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
to make my eyebrows look a little bit

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.090 
to make my eyebrows look a little bit
straighter<00:03:33.959> because<00:03:34.290> that's<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:34.620> hers<00:03:34.830> look

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.199 
with my ring finger and my pinky and
this<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> great<00:03:41.010> step<00:03:41.340> especially<00:03:41.670> because

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
this is a great step especially because

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.479 
this is a great step especially because
it's<00:03:42.420> also<00:03:42.630> going<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.290> give<00:03:43.920> your<00:03:44.040> brows<00:03:44.280> a

you<00:05:13.710> could<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:14.039> that<00:05:14.280> because<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.610> do<00:05:14.669> self-tan

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
you could see that because I do self-tan

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.260

but I don't self tan my face so we're

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.490 
but I don't self tan my face so we're
going<00:05:18.419> in<00:05:18.659> with<00:05:18.840> Mac's<00:05:18.990> prolongwear

concealer<00:05:19.620> but<00:05:20.370> what<00:05:20.550> has<00:05:20.819> changed<00:05:20.849> is<00:05:21.479> I'm

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
concealer but what has changed is I'm

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.379 
concealer but what has changed is I'm
using<00:05:21.870> nw15<00:05:22.860> because<00:05:23.550> in<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.819> picture<00:05:24.180> her

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
using nw15 because in the picture her

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.899 
using nw15 because in the picture her
highlight<00:05:24.780> was<00:05:25.020> very<00:05:25.560> intense<00:05:26.159> it<00:05:26.430> was<00:05:26.520> very

highlight was very intense it was very

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.390 
highlight was very intense it was very
light<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:27.960> why<00:05:28.199> I'm<00:05:28.379> using<00:05:28.409> a<00:05:28.800> lighter

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
that as best as possible and now I'm

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.360 
that as best as possible and now I'm
taking<00:06:30.960> one<00:06:31.289> of<00:06:31.319> my<00:06:31.409> favorite<00:06:31.830> brushes<00:06:32.039> this

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
taking one of my favorite brushes this

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.219 
taking one of my favorite brushes this
is<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.699> large<00:06:32.909> powder<00:06:33.210> brush<00:06:33.330> by<00:06:33.690> Sigma<00:06:34.199> and

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
is the large powder brush by Sigma and

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.200 
is the large powder brush by Sigma and
I'm<00:06:34.590> blending<00:06:34.860> out<00:06:35.190> that<00:06:35.430> contour<00:06:35.909> so<00:06:36.029> that<00:06:36.120> we

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
I'm blending out that contour so that we

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.320 
I'm blending out that contour so that we
have<00:06:36.300> no<00:06:36.509> harsh<00:06:36.870> lines<00:06:37.699> okay<00:06:38.699> so<00:06:38.759> now<00:06:39.089> we're

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
have no harsh lines okay so now we're

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.970 
have no harsh lines okay so now we're
kind<00:06:39.599> of<00:06:39.719> going<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.930> be<00:06:39.960> bronzer<00:06:40.620> deep

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
kind of going to be bronzer deep

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.650 
kind of going to be bronzer deep
and<00:06:41.280> used<00:06:41.460> two<00:06:41.700> different<00:06:41.730> bronzers<00:06:42.390> today

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
and used two different bronzers today

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.720 
and used two different bronzers today
and<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:43.020> reason<00:06:43.410> is<00:06:43.710> because<00:06:43.980> the<00:06:44.430> hoola

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
and the reason is because the hoola

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.970 
and the reason is because the hoola
bronzer<00:06:44.820> that<00:06:45.180> we<00:06:45.300> just<00:06:45.480> used<00:06:45.810> wasn't<00:06:46.620> her

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
bronzer that we just used wasn't her

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.580 
bronzer that we just used wasn't her
skin<00:06:47.400> color<00:06:47.640> exactly<00:06:48.210> so<00:06:48.900> now<00:06:48.930> we're<00:06:49.140> going<00:06:49.290> in

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
skin color exactly so now we're going in

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.710 
skin color exactly so now we're going in
with<00:06:49.830> a<00:06:49.980> Mac<00:06:50.370> bronzer<00:06:51.030> well<00:06:51.420> this<00:06:51.600> is

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
with a Mac bronzer well this is

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.150 
with a Mac bronzer well this is
technically<00:06:52.080> a<00:06:52.170> powder<00:06:52.470> but<00:06:52.650> I<00:06:52.740> use<00:06:52.890> it<00:06:52.920> as<00:06:53.130> a

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
technically a powder but I use it as a

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.760 
technically a powder but I use it as a
bronzer<00:06:53.640> and<00:06:53.790> it's<00:06:54.360> more<00:06:54.750> closely<00:06:55.260> related<00:06:55.590> to

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
bronzer and it's more closely related to
