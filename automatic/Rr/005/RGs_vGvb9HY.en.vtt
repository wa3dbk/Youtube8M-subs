00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.630
Far away, the beginning is far away,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.580
I’m sending an inaudible song but,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.100
Far away, the ending is far away,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.540
A dazzling darkness is swayed.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.360
And so,,,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.810
I am only the one that controls

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.650
Determined fate carved in like a scar from nails scratching,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.040
Guiding all to a land of interrupted dreams.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.330
Still stagnant, the heart passes on;

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.400
On night split by that sin,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.420
A peace far uglier than war sleeps,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.410
While love is kept apart.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.500
Far away, endlessly far away,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.340
Because the world is locked away in a miniature garden,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.940
Far away, without destination far away,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.340
I chase after the answer I’ve lost sight of.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.330
And so,,,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.620
You are the one who protects

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.550
Decided fate throbbing like a scar.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.860
With the tips of these fingers trifling, all on whim.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.180
Though sparkling, the heart darkens;

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.260
On nights which divide that time,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:55.170
You will know an eternity shorter than an instant

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.180
If you look down from that sky.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.480
Still stagnant, the heart passes on;

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
On nights split by that sin,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.530
A peace far uglier than war sleeps,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.540
While love is kept apart.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.320
Though sparkling, the heart darkens;

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.410
On nights which divide that time,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.400
You will know an eternity shorter than an instant

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.980
If you look down from that sky.
