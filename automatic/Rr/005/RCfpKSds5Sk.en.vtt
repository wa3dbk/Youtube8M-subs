00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.290 
seemed responsive you got your turbo
start<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.750> RB<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:49.080> your<00:02:49.770> left<00:02:50.010> trigger<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
start your RB or your left trigger is a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.000 
start your RB or your left trigger is a
lot<00:02:51.570> smaller<00:02:51.840> than<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> left<00:02:52.440> trigger<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
lot smaller than the left trigger on the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.050 
lot smaller than the left trigger on the
old<00:02:53.190> version<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.820> would<00:02:54.209> say<00:02:55.940> yeah<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> lot

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
old version I would say yeah it's a lot

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.770 
old version I would say yeah it's a lot
more<00:03:00.120> responsive<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.380> tell<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.769> you

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
more responsive I could tell that you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
more responsive I could tell that you
hear<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.760> no<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.660> yeah<00:03:10.430> maybe<00:03:11.430> that's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
hear that no this so yeah maybe that's

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
hear that no this so yeah maybe that's
just<00:03:11.820> because<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.239> new<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.390> yeah<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.200> bonds

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
just because it's new but yeah the bonds

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
just because it's new but yeah the bonds
are<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.340> trigger<00:03:14.910> buttons<00:03:15.269> are<00:03:15.600> small

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
are a lot the trigger buttons are small

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.350 
are a lot the trigger buttons are small
on<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> top<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.579> buttons<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.060> think

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
on at the top the buttons I think

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.350 
on at the top the buttons I think
overall<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.170> same<00:03:19.380> size<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.700> d-pad<00:03:21.120> is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
overall the same size the d-pad is

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.199 
overall the same size the d-pad is
smaller<00:03:25.370> it's<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.549> bit<00:03:26.700> smaller<00:03:26.910> not

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
smaller it's a little bit smaller not

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.880 
smaller it's a little bit smaller not
too<00:03:27.390> much<00:03:27.570> but<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.959> mean<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.410> got<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.650> extra

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
too much but I mean you got that extra

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.720 
too much but I mean you got that extra
space<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.250> move<00:03:30.090> around<00:03:30.269> um<00:03:31.430> for<00:03:32.430> some<00:03:32.610> weird

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
space to move around um for some weird

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.210 
space to move around um for some weird
reason<00:03:32.850> i<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> grips<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> sides<00:03:34.739> of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
reason i like the grips on the sides of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.330 
reason i like the grips on the sides of
this<00:03:35.430> control<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.480> old<00:03:36.600> d-pad<00:03:37.340> compared

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
this control of the old d-pad compared

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.330 
this control of the old d-pad compared
to<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.269> grips<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.900> here

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
to this you don't have no grips on here

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.259 
to this you don't have no grips on here
it's<00:03:41.340> nothing<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.420> seems<00:03:43.820> cheaper<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.030> sense

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
it's nothing it seems cheaper in a sense

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.949 
it's nothing it seems cheaper in a sense
but<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.510> mean<00:03:46.250> it's<00:03:47.250> smaller<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.970> maybe<00:03:48.690> that's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
but I mean it's smaller and maybe that's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.420 
but I mean it's smaller and maybe that's
why<00:03:49.140> they<00:03:49.200> didn't<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.890> grips<00:03:50.130> but<00:03:50.400> I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
why they didn't have the grips but I

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.330 
why they didn't have the grips but I
mean<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> grips<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.269> really<00:03:51.720> like<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.340> grips

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
mean the grips I really like the grips

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.979 
mean the grips I really like the grips
but<00:03:53.579> they<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.269> anymore<00:03:54.329> on<00:03:54.750> these

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
but they don't have it anymore on these

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.310 
but they don't have it anymore on these
as<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.709> see<00:03:56.480> no<00:03:57.480> gloss<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.079> back

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
as you can see no gloss on the back

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.000 
as you can see no gloss on the back
either<00:04:00.110> seems<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.440> type<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.829> like

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
either seems like just type of like

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.420 
either seems like just type of like
carbon<00:04:02.970> fiber<00:04:03.870> or<00:04:04.110> something<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:04.799> but

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
carbon fiber or something on now but

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.750 
carbon fiber or something on now but
yeah<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.989> front<00:04:07.260> too<00:04:07.470> doesn't<00:04:08.190> seem<00:04:08.310> as<00:04:08.579> lousy

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
yeah the front too doesn't seem as lousy

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.810 
yeah the front too doesn't seem as lousy
as<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.180> used<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.600> but<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.810> mean<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:11.370> just<00:04:11.430> seems

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
as it used to but I mean it just seems

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.300 
as it used to but I mean it just seems
like<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.600> overall<00:04:12.959> great<00:04:13.109> control<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
like an overall great control so on and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.819 
like an overall great control so on and
it<00:04:14.760> seems<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> longer<00:04:15.540> cord<00:04:15.750> too<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.590> hope

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
it seems like a longer cord too so hope

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.880 
it seems like a longer cord too so hope
