Scotch red and Austrian pine it's a very

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
symptomatic basically the infection will

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.860 
symptomatic basically the infection will
take<00:00:57.440> place<00:00:57.590> at<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:58.100> tip<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.480> newly

emerging soft tissues of the pine tree

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
emerging soft tissues of the pine tree
and<00:01:03.019> they<00:01:03.890> will<00:01:04.100> curl<00:01:05.110> usually<00:01:06.110> upward<00:01:06.590> or

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
and they will curl usually upward or

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.830 
and they will curl usually upward or
downward<00:01:06.830> slightly<00:01:07.760> as<00:01:07.940> they<00:01:08.509> become

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
downward slightly as they become

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.149 
downward slightly as they become
infected<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:11.049> fruiting<00:01:12.049> bodies<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
infected the fruiting bodies of the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.580 
infected the fruiting bodies of the
fungus<00:01:13.580> are<00:01:13.790> can<00:01:14.509> be<00:01:14.540> found<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.229> needles

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
fungus are can be found on the needles

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.330 
fungus are can be found on the needles
quite<00:01:16.460> frequently<00:01:17.380> they're<00:01:18.380> kind<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.070> hidden

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
quite frequently they're kind of hidden

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.890 
quite frequently they're kind of hidden
and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.000> go<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.390> base<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and you have to go to the base of the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.490 
and you have to go to the base of the
needle<00:01:21.200> or<00:01:21.729> more<00:01:22.729> often<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.930> found<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.409> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
needle or more often it's found in the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.120 
needle or more often it's found in the
pine<00:01:24.710> cones<00:01:25.119> so<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.600> lot<00:01:26.930> of<00:01:27.079> times<00:01:27.290> people<00:01:27.590> on

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
pine cones so a lot of times people on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.910 
pine cones so a lot of times people on
growers<00:01:28.610> don't<00:01:28.850> recognize<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.509> fact<00:01:29.689> that

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
growers don't recognize the fact that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.499 
growers don't recognize the fact that
picking<00:01:30.920> up<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.250> pine<00:01:31.490> cones<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.270> pine

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
picking up the pine cones in a pine

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.510 
picking up the pine cones in a pine
forest<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:33.290> actually<00:01:33.710> beneficial<00:01:33.860> because

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
forest is actually beneficial because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.780 
forest is actually beneficial because
you're<00:01:34.939> reducing<00:01:35.479> inoculum<00:01:36.140> with<00:01:36.290> deploy<00:01:36.560> dia

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
you're reducing inoculum with deploy dia

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.719 
you're reducing inoculum with deploy dia
most<00:01:37.790> inoculum<00:01:38.450> comes<00:01:39.110> from<00:01:39.530> pine<00:01:40.100> windrows

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
most inoculum comes from pine windrows

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.389 
most inoculum comes from pine windrows
so<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:41.750> you're<00:01:41.930> growing<00:01:42.290> young<00:01:42.530> pines<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
so if you're growing young pines the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.280 
so if you're growing young pines the
spores<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> deploy<00:01:44.240> do<00:01:44.420> will<00:01:44.750> come<00:01:45.049> from

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
spores of the deploy do will come from

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.429 
spores of the deploy do will come from
these<00:01:45.530> older<00:01:45.680> trees<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.700> pine<00:01:46.969> cones<00:01:47.270> on<00:01:48.020> them

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
these older trees the pine cones on them

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.670 
these older trees the pine cones on them
or<00:01:48.680> under<00:01:49.280> them<00:01:49.490> will<00:01:50.060> be<00:01:50.299> supplying<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.469> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
or under them will be supplying the the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.440 
or under them will be supplying the the
fruiting<00:01:52.040> bodies<00:01:52.369> that<00:01:52.549> produce<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.060> spores

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
fruiting bodies that produce the spores

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.260 
fruiting bodies that produce the spores
so<00:01:54.409> it's<00:01:54.619> important<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.219> get<00:01:55.399> sprays<00:01:55.820> on<00:01:56.090> at

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
so it's important to get sprays on at

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.660 
so it's important to get sprays on at
the<00:01:56.390> right<00:01:56.540> time<00:01:56.840> again<00:01:57.409> usually<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.490> about

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the right time again usually at about

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.690 
the right time again usually at about
the<00:01:59.000> time<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.200> tissue<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.860> breaking<00:02:01.490> bud

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
the time that the tissue is breaking bud

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.749 
the time that the tissue is breaking bud
and<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.659> soft<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.380> can<00:02:03.560> also<00:02:03.740> cause<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.159> canker

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
and it's soft it can also cause a canker

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.399 
and it's soft it can also cause a canker
disease<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.570> it

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
disease and it

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.139 
disease and it
and<00:02:06.499> actually<00:02:06.799> start<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.460> move<00:02:07.729> into<00:02:07.969> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and actually start to move into the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.300 
and actually start to move into the
branches<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:08.840> kill<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.349> higher<00:02:09.619> branches

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
branches and kill and higher branches

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.699 
branches and kill and higher branches
once<00:02:10.940> those<00:02:11.150> entire<00:02:11.480> branches<00:02:12.019> die<00:02:12.230> then

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
once those entire branches die then

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.100 
once those entire branches die then
borers<00:02:13.220> will<00:02:13.459> come<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.510> tree<00:02:14.750> will<00:02:14.959> go

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
borers will come in and the tree will go

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.130 
borers will come in and the tree will go
into<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.560> rapid<00:02:16.190> decline<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.940> basically<00:02:17.599> it

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
into a rapid decline and basically it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.330 
into a rapid decline and basically it
started<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.220> deploy<00:02:19.549> dia<00:02:19.730> infections
