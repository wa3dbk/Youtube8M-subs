thing I did say in that video was that
even<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.869> Goku<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> number<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.100> his<00:01:38.820> drive<00:01:39.240> is

previous videos one thing I must say

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.430 
previous videos one thing I must say
though<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.150> Vegeta<00:02:22.660> does<00:02:23.050> seem<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.350> little

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
though is that Vegeta does seem a little

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.170 
though is that Vegeta does seem a little
bit<00:02:23.800> more<00:02:23.980> wild<00:02:24.340> than<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.910> would<00:02:25.150> have

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
bit more wild than I would have

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
bit more wild than I would have
anticipated<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.560> thought<00:02:26.710> that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
anticipated I would have thought that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.430 
anticipated I would have thought that
ever<00:02:27.490> since<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> aftermath<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.230> Buu

ever since the aftermath of the Buu

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.250 
ever since the aftermath of the Buu
fight<00:02:29.740> Vegeta<00:02:30.280> might<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.330> been<00:02:31.540> more<00:02:31.780> tamed

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
fight Vegeta might have been more tamed

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.050 
fight Vegeta might have been more tamed
than<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:34.570> least<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.960> would<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.800> thought

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
than we or at least I would have thought

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390 
than we or at least I would have thought
however<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.870> episode<00:02:38.290> clearly<00:02:38.650> shows<00:02:38.920> that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
however this episode clearly shows that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.430 
however this episode clearly shows that
Vegeta's<00:02:39.970> killer<00:02:40.600> instinct<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.290> his

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
Vegeta's killer instinct and his

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.670 
Vegeta's killer instinct and his
fighting<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.130> still<00:02:43.030> very<00:02:43.300> much<00:02:43.480> intact<00:02:44.080> which

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
fighting is still very much intact which

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.590 
fighting is still very much intact which
is<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> quite<00:02:45.370> honestly<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.880> good<00:02:46.180> thing<00:02:46.420> because

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
is a quite honestly a good thing because

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.650 
is a quite honestly a good thing because
the<00:02:47.290> rivalry<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.190> Vegeta<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:48.970> Goku<00:02:49.090> had

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the rivalry that Vegeta and Goku had

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
the rivalry that Vegeta and Goku had
created<00:02:50.200> some<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.500> best<00:02:50.530> drama<00:02:51.070> that

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
created some of the best drama that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.640 
created some of the best drama that
Dragonball<00:02:51.880> ever<00:02:52.180> had<00:02:52.390> however<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.200> must<00:02:53.410> say

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
Dragonball ever had however I must say

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.770 
Dragonball ever had however I must say
the<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.100> interesting<00:02:54.820> part<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> episode

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the more interesting part of the episode

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.990 
the more interesting part of the episode
was<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.140> stuff<00:02:56.560> with<00:02:56.770> piercing<00:02:57.370> wheeze<00:02:57.610> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
was the stuff with piercing wheeze and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720 
was the stuff with piercing wheeze and
although<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.290> can't<00:02:59.650> really<00:02:59.890> talk<00:03:00.220> too<00:03:00.550> much

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
although I can't really talk too much

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.570 
although I can't really talk too much
about<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.930> portion<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> episode

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
about this portion of the episode

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.310 
about this portion of the episode
because<00:03:03.790> quite<00:03:04.210> honestly<00:03:04.600> I'm<00:03:04.750> already<00:03:04.990> going

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
because quite honestly I'm already going

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.650 
because quite honestly I'm already going
to<00:03:05.350> be<00:03:05.560> making<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:06.010> video<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.730> however<00:03:07.420> I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
to be making a video on this however I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.090 
to be making a video on this however I
did<00:03:07.840> want<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.080> comment<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.740> couple<00:03:08.770> things

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
did want to comment on a couple things

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.780 
did want to comment on a couple things
like<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:10.000> instance<00:03:10.350> Bierce<00:03:11.350> being<00:03:11.770> awake<00:03:12.310> now

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
like for instance Bierce being awake now

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.240 
like for instance Bierce being awake now
we<00:03:12.850> did<00:03:13.150> see<00:03:13.390> Bierce<00:03:13.720> awake<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.410> episode<00:03:14.920> 1

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
we did see Bierce awake in episode 1

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.330 
we did see Bierce awake in episode 1
however<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:16.360> didn't<00:03:16.720> know<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.320> time<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:18.100> this

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
however we didn't know what time it this

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.270 
however we didn't know what time it this
took<00:03:18.640> place<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:19.590> episode<00:03:20.590> 2<00:03:20.770> it's<00:03:20.950> pretty

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
took place in episode 2 it's pretty

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280 
took place in episode 2 it's pretty
heavily<00:03:21.820> implied<00:03:22.210> that<00:03:22.510> what<00:03:22.870> we're<00:03:23.050> seeing

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
heavily implied that what we're seeing

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500 
heavily implied that what we're seeing
is<00:03:23.530> taking<00:03:23.890> place<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.550> current<00:03:24.940> time<00:03:25.210> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
is taking place in the current time and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.690 
is taking place in the current time and
the<00:03:25.860> reason<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:26.950> find<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.370> very<00:03:27.460> interesting

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the reason I find this very interesting

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.570 
the reason I find this very interesting
is<00:03:28.330> because<00:03:28.750> if<00:03:29.200> anyone<00:03:29.590> remembers<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.250> battle

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
is because if anyone remembers in battle

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.090 
is because if anyone remembers in battle
of<00:03:30.670> gods<00:03:31.260> Bierce<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.470> supposed<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.920> be

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
of gods Bierce is supposed to be

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.970 
of gods Bierce is supposed to be
sleeping<00:03:33.520> at<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.180> time<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:35.020> like<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.740> said

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
sleeping at this time now like I said

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.740 
sleeping at this time now like I said
before<00:03:36.160> I'm<00:03:36.580> going<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.970> cover<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
before I'm going to cover this in a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.570 
before I'm going to cover this in a
future<00:03:38.110> video<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.800> it's<00:03:39.040> quite<00:03:39.280> irrelevant

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
future video and it's quite irrelevant

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.760 
future video and it's quite irrelevant
to<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.360> review<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:40.960> episode<00:03:41.470> but<00:03:41.709> I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
to just the review of this episode but I

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.949 
to just the review of this episode but I
did<00:03:42.070> find<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.730> lot<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.390> things<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.840> were

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
did find a lot of the things that were

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.680 
did find a lot of the things that were
said<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.590> we<00:03:45.130> did<00:03:45.370> see<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.970> hat<00:03:46.180> second

half<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.260> episode<00:03:47.740> very<00:03:47.950> interesting

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
half of this episode very interesting

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.550 
half of this episode very interesting
all<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.240> all<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.510> really<00:03:49.810> feel<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.110> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
all in all I really feel that the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.380 
all in all I really feel that the
impression<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.190> got<00:03:51.370> from<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.730> episode<00:03:52.240> is

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
impression I got from this episode is

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.570 
impression I got from this episode is
that<00:03:52.620> even<00:03:53.620> though<00:03:53.830> it's<00:03:54.040> going<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.459> be

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
that even though it's going to be

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.180 
that even though it's going to be
retelling<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.180> story<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.470> battle<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.920> gods

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
retelling the story of battle of gods

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.420 
retelling the story of battle of gods
and<00:03:57.670> although<00:03:58.360> I<00:03:58.570> wasn't<00:03:59.290> too<00:03:59.470> fond<00:03:59.890> of<00:04:00.190> that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and although I wasn't too fond of that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.030 
and although I wasn't too fond of that
idea<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.330> think<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.080> can<00:04:02.230> definitely<00:04:02.830> work

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
idea I think that it can definitely work

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.949 
idea I think that it can definitely work
it<00:04:03.340> actually<00:04:03.520> got<00:04:03.910> me<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> little<00:04:04.330> pumped<00:04:04.810> up

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
it actually got me a little pumped up

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.100 
it actually got me a little pumped up
for<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> beer<00:04:05.530> PSA's<00:04:05.830> introduction<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.790> earth

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
for a beer PSA's introduction to earth

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.570 
for a beer PSA's introduction to earth
because<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.140> see<00:04:08.560> what<00:04:08.740> they're<00:04:08.890> doing<00:04:09.250> they're

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
because I see what they're doing they're

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.640 
because I see what they're doing they're
setting<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.120> Bierce<00:04:10.420> as<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.660> credible<00:04:11.230> villain

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
setting up Bierce as a credible villain

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.590 
setting up Bierce as a credible villain
and<00:04:11.800> threat<00:04:12.130> that's<00:04:12.400> why<00:04:12.610> we<00:04:12.760> see<00:04:12.970> him<00:04:13.120> blowing

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
and threat that's why we see him blowing

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.900 
and threat that's why we see him blowing
up<00:04:13.780> these<00:04:13.959> planets<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.740> that<00:04:14.800> builds<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
up these planets and that builds the

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.880 
up these planets and that builds the
tension<00:04:16.390> up<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.750> it<00:04:16.840> kind<00:04:17.080> of<00:04:17.200> worked<00:04:17.440> on<00:04:17.680> me

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
tension up and it kind of worked on me

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.770 
tension up and it kind of worked on me
at<00:04:18.040> least<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.549> do<00:04:18.670> feel<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.239> really<00:04:19.570> does

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
at least I do feel that really does

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.360 
at least I do feel that really does
create<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.350> tension<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.919> drama<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
create the tension on the drama that

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.400 
create the tension on the drama that
we're<00:04:21.580> gonna<00:04:21.669> be<00:04:21.880> seeing<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.690> mean<00:04:23.320> I'm

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
we're gonna be seeing and I mean I'm

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.920 
we're gonna be seeing and I mean I'm
gonna<00:04:23.530> say<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.160> think<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.669> if<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.510> cards

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
gonna say it I think that if the cards

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.650 
gonna say it I think that if the cards
are<00:04:26.050> played

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
are played

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.360 
are played
right<00:04:26.780> from<00:04:27.290> what<00:04:27.500> I'm<00:04:27.620> seeing<00:04:27.650> from<00:04:28.190> this

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
right from what I'm seeing from this

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.960 
right from what I'm seeing from this
episode<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.690> Dragon<00:04:30.230> Ball<00:04:30.440> super<00:04:30.950> version<00:04:31.520> of

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
episode the Dragon Ball super version of

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.040 
episode the Dragon Ball super version of
the<00:04:32.510> beer<00:04:32.990> story<00:04:33.530> could<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:35.030> lot<00:04:35.780> more

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the beer story could be a lot more

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.610 
the beer story could be a lot more
dramatic<00:04:37.240> climactic<00:04:38.240> than<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.170> battle<00:04:39.530> of

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
dramatic climactic than the battle of

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.950 
dramatic climactic than the battle of
gods<00:04:39.860> version<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.730> I<00:04:40.880> know<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.480> huge

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
gods version and I know that's a huge

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840 
gods version and I know that's a huge
thing<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.380> say<00:04:42.590> because<00:04:42.800> battle<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.370> gods<00:04:43.520> came

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
thing to say because battle of gods came

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.150 
thing to say because battle of gods came
first<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.540> there<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> lot<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.740> mixed

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
first and there is a lot of mixed

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.970 
first and there is a lot of mixed
feelings<00:04:46.400> out<00:04:46.850> there<00:04:46.990> for<00:04:47.990> super<00:04:48.620> being

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
feelings out there for super being

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.250 
feelings out there for super being
retelling<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.820> events<00:04:50.540> of<00:04:50.660> battle<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.080> God

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
retelling the events of battle of God

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.880 
retelling the events of battle of God
but<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.890> actually<00:04:52.430> think<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.360> super<00:04:54.320> just<00:04:54.740> the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
but I actually think that super just the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.250 
but I actually think that super just the
way<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.310> building<00:04:56.140> everything<00:04:57.140> up

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
way it's building everything up

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.040 
way it's building everything up
especially<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.950> way<00:04:58.070> it's<00:04:58.250> building<00:04:58.670> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
especially the way it's building the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.480 
especially the way it's building the
premonitions<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.200> Super<00:05:00.560> Saiyan<00:05:00.800> God<00:05:01.070> and

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
premonitions of Super Saiyan God and
