00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.960
 this is the second quick view video 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 of the knives that I have pending 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.480
 to review and how they can realize 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 of all this big pile of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.599
 cutting tools I have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.849
 mainly machetes my goal is 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.760
 prepare the great comparative test of 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.650
 machetes like the great test of 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.600
 cv create the machete that I have my hands 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.699
 is the s &amp; p 8 of Ontario that I have already 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.790
 revised therefore I'm not going to 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.879
 take care of the second one that I already reviewed is the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.070
 machete q believes of caster that I believe that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.449
 it's going to be one of the tools 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.519
 important in this comparison but that 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.549
 I have also reviewed it on occasion 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.330
 previous and the third is the cookie 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:53.100
 cache of the extreme action that is 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.780
 significantly different to all 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.510
 that we have here and that soon 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.869
 I will review mainly for the quality 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 of its materials and finishes now of 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.270
 this big pack of machetes that I have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.630
 Here I have already reviewed the pacora machete 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.630
 long-handled tramontine which had 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.600
 a supremely poor performance which 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.670
 You can see it in the posted video 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 and include in the bottom of the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 description of this video but that now 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.740
 for the new comparison I have brought the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 second version of the pac now of the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.229
 same brand tramontina the performance 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.409
 promises to be different especially because 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.440
 is pac now that having a mango more 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.710
 short and a longer leaf has 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.840
 rather more force in the cut is a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.750
 little harder to maneuver but at 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.789
 have it is the leaf a little thicker and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.420
 slightly changed dimensions 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.060
 I think it's going to be a result 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 significantly different from the previous 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.640
 the next container is the pac hour 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.549
 of a high as you may realize 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.520
 this pac now has a handle in two 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.039
 substantially longer pieces is 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.440
 between the two previous ones has a hook 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.290
 much more pronounced for handling 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 of the vegetation and the way in which 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.060
 the handle is carved allows to make another 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.569
 type of movements with this pac now 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.319
 I also assume that the steel in this one is 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.690
 a higher carbon level than that of 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.330
 tramontina and I anticipate having a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.819
 performance possibly better than 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.519
 previous unfortunately this version 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.430
 it comes without a sharp edge therefore I will have to 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.280
 do a machetes preparation 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.709
 pre-test or all designs 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.709
 important that I think it's going to have a 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.470
 very good performance is this that is a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.470
 variation of the Latin machete design 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.470
 where the tip is significantly 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.030
 more enlarged and it's called the potbellied 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.920
 these two are Colombians this has a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.380
 t 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.810
 anti-corrosive nickel plating while 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.820
 this is crude I chose them simply in 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.130
 both finished to see the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.280
 consequences it is possible to achieve it has 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.280
 alternating this in raw and this in 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.360
 nickel-plated and what I have here is a 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.750
 18 inch version that is this and a 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.090
 version in 21 that is this the next 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.840
 machete is this cornet eagle of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 Colombian manufacture of 24 inches in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.250
 the moment is the biggest machete 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.560
 length that I have in the collection and that 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.660
 I'm about to try the big test 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.830
 that I am preparing just like the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.020
 other unsharpened goods and the design is 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.970
 equivalent with which other manufacturers 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.640
 they call it bold the reference with which 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.950
 it is known in Colombia is null 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.960
 last I have three machetes that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.630
 stand out for their characteristics 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.690
 the first one is the machete 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.140
 katana rib is called Cutlass 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.030
 two hands and has a handle 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.290
 exceptionally long has also 24 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.110
 inches 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.290
 long sheet and feature 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.500
 particular of this is that by having this 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.870
 handle in such a thick polymer makes 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.680
 becomes an element of a 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.169
 neutral balance in theory to facilitate 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.460
 brandish what the last two are 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.699
 clearly my favorites of the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 collection is the smart set of col steel 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.830
 which is a modern version of the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.250
 Trench knife cutter with 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.180
 same name only that is adapted to the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.000
 modern technology with a sheet of 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.930
 machete of 2 and a half millimeters and a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.050
 Large polymer handle with handguard 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.139
 to preserve the original design as 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.690
 you can imagine the center of mass of 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.750
 the leaf is very close to this area by 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.400
 so it is supremely fast in the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.849
 movement can be used 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.370
 easily to cut in this distance 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.669
 Pretty short on the hand like a sole 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.550
 and the length of the sheet is also proper 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.500
 mount a machete by 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.830
 the design of the second world war 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.770
 It was used not only with a knife 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.330
 trench but like a knife 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.310
 utility is one of the designs of the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:31.380
 which have higher expectations 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:35.110
 and finally I have a scratch in my hands 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.530
 Thai these machetes are made to 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.810
 are forged as they can be 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.270
 account for the finished and this in 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.810
 particular has hollow handle to be 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.760
 forged from a sheet usually of 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.920
 5160 recycled steel suspension 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.190
 a truck for example is possible 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.780
 achieve that the sheet has a thickness 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.440
 differential as you may realize 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.590
 I estimate that it has about 7 millimeters in the 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.700
 base and it descends about 4 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.980
 at the tip 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.860
 obviously the sharpening is also by hand 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.830
 which throws a very uneven edge but 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.630
 a surprisingly good balance 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.990
 those are some of the machetes that 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:26.270
 I plan to take on the big test and it's the 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.270
 which I hope your opinion
