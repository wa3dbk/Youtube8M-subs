00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
make sure the computer is turned off and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
make sure the computer is turned off and
there's<00:00:13.860> no<00:00:13.920> power<00:00:14.309> sources<00:00:14.670> hooked<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.150> to

there's no power sources hooked up to
the<00:00:15.360> computer<00:00:16.699> lay<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:17.940> its<00:00:17.970> side<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:19.080> on

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the computer lay it on its side first on

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
the computer lay it on its side first on
the<00:00:19.380> top<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> pulled<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.340> pops<00:00:20.880> off

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the top here if you pulled it pops off

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.570 
the top here if you pulled it pops off
this<00:00:21.210> side<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.189> DVD

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580

they are very small so be careful not to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
they are very small so be careful not to
lose<00:00:57.240> them

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539

cable just pulls right out first a DVD
ROM<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:34.799> cd-rom<00:01:35.630> now<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> new<00:01:37.289> one

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
ROM or cd-rom now to put the new one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.789 
ROM or cd-rom now to put the new one
back<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:38.869> let's<00:01:39.869> grab<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.500> replacement<00:01:42.799> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
back in let's grab your replacement it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.919 
back in let's grab your replacement it
is<00:01:43.950> easier<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> plug<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> cable<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> first<00:01:45.479> due

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
is easier to plug the cable in first due

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.710 
is easier to plug the cable in first due
to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> casing<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> hook<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> cable<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to the casing so hook that cable in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.499 
to the casing so hook that cable in
first<00:01:48.990> nice<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> tight<00:01:53.899> yeah<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.240> force

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
first nice and tight yeah so don't force

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.730 
first nice and tight yeah so don't force
if<00:01:57.750> you're<00:01:57.869> forcing<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.440> pull<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
if you're forcing it you pull you have

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.359 
if you're forcing it you pull you have
it<00:01:58.830> upside<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.750> yes<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.860> should<00:02:05.100> slide

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it upside down yes so it should slide

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.680 
it upside down yes so it should slide
right<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> without<00:02:06.390> any<00:02:06.679> forcing<00:02:08.299> now<00:02:09.299> on<00:02:09.479> one

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
right in without any forcing now on one

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
right in without any forcing now on one
side<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> sheet<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.370> some<00:02:11.640> small

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
side of the sheet there are some small

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.720 
side of the sheet there are some small
little<00:02:12.480> notches<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.620> those<00:02:13.980> two<00:02:14.489> small

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
little notches and those two small

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.820 
little notches and those two small
notches<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> opposite<00:02:16.200> side<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> where

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
notches on the opposite side of where

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.170 
notches on the opposite side of where
the<00:02:16.860> screws<00:02:17.130> were<00:02:17.549> will<00:02:18.450> fit<00:02:18.870> into<00:02:19.970> screw<00:02:20.970> like

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the screws were will fit into screw like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.849 
the screws were will fit into screw like
holes<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:21.840> side<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.440> got<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.709> line

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
holes on one side so we got to line

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:30.990 
holes on one side so we got to line
those<00:02:23.100> up

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090 

once<00:02:31.600> those<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.110> I'll<00:02:32.350> slide<00:02:32.650> right<00:02:32.890> in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
once those are in I'll slide right in

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.070 
once those are in I'll slide right in
and<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.640> your<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.330> screw<00:02:34.600> holes<00:02:34.630> should

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
and then your two screw holes should

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.690 
and then your two screw holes should
match<00:02:35.320> up<00:02:35.560> with<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.860> threading<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.430> again

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
match up with the threading and again

00:02:39.700 --> 00:03:20.610 
match up with the threading and again
these<00:02:39.880> are<00:02:40.060> small

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.589 

hey<00:03:21.130> once<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.610> bullet<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.300> screws

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
hey once you have bullet the screws

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.920 
hey once you have bullet the screws
tightened<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.290> there<00:03:24.420> just<00:03:25.420> make<00:03:25.599> sure<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
tightened in there just make sure the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.520 
tightened in there just make sure the
cd-rom<00:03:26.349> is<00:03:26.830> facing<00:03:27.459> upright<00:03:27.819> correctly<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
cd-rom is facing upright correctly and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.229 
cd-rom is facing upright correctly and
place<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.860> might<00:03:33.250> help<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.670> pull<00:03:33.910> up<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> lever

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
place it might help to pull up the lever

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.960 
place it might help to pull up the lever
here<00:03:34.630> don't<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.739> set<00:03:36.340> there<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.819> just

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
here don't you have a set there you just

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.490 
here don't you have a set there you just
push<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.390> forward<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.780> I'll<00:03:37.900> snap<00:03:38.140> right<00:03:38.349> into

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
push it forward and I'll snap right into
