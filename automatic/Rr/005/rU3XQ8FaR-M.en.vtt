00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.310
 this is now ten years and we 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.090
 He met through the family ever more 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 unusual and he 's an agent he likes me 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.369
 at a party that we went to and I opened a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.649
 our and we believe they gave of cupid 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 so do not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.840
 and that's when I took the initiative and was a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.030
 I hardly lived in Teresópolis 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 I already lived in Niterói 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 and there it would rise and fall from all 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 week after practically doing 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.270
 college on the river and then I had to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.969
 opportunity to travel and stay away from 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.789
 year with scholarship studying and when 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.649
 returned she moved in with me when 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.579
 people moved here I started to 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.070
 buy a lot of people at heart and I started 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 to see this beautiful house in the magazine 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 and I saw that I had the magazine's 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.689
 Playboy does not hurt to try so 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.729
 They said I need a little hand was mine. 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.659
 God, nobody, nothing now almost deceives 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.659
 lotteries 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.140
 is the one that the space passes the greater part 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.410
 of time and what I like most here in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.970
 space is my little corner of memory that 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.010
 I'm graduated in tourism work 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 culture on my computer that the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.600
 build a son for me because he passes 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.630
 hours of the day with me that I do not like is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.760
 Very low Chinese table height 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.680
 for me height of this shelf too 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.440
 that she came with an apartment and that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.290
 I do not like the track I have here . 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.990
 expose in a style and I think she does not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.870
 It has a lot to do with space and I 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.680
 I wish it was a little corner but 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.410
 female a little more like this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.170
 colored but Sunday receives many 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.330
 visits, mainly from my parents and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.000
 of my in-laws and need a couch 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.760
 bed for people to use that space 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.090
 transform into an office room bar 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.090
 of oil 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.600
 I am vivianne bridges I am a designer 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.400
 of interiors and blog 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.960
 I 'm here to be able to help Paula. 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.850
 turn this setting in environments 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.020
 more cool to be able to pass the time 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.700
 to work 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.500
 decorating the environment is to make 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.750
 more pleasant space for those who live there 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.650
 for those who enjoy that environment 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.650
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:09.120
 The cool side is now 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.560
 In this way, we did in the studio and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.970
 ahead of it is cork and you can 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.430
 put photos scrap tickets then 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.439
 the pins of the photos I chose one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.689
 conflict that has to do with travel 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.609
 tourism that is what you work now 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.099
 second two modules to place 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.890
 how many books you need we made 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.750
 the two modules with mdf and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.829
 painted with spray paint 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.379
 I'm going to close the door to my surprise 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.840
 people made a graphic on the door that 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.849
 also leaves the modern environment 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.190
 more cool and also feminine is a 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.019
 interesting and creative cheap detail 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.420
 that we made the insulation 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.459
 we bought three more furniture 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.849
 important the environment at the desk 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.909
 is a piece of furniture from my 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.129
 pretty pretty wooden furniture two basic 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.930
 Large drawer space for you 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.750
 working the chain is also quite 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.639
 comfortable and beautiful is something that 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.629
 You wanted a chair that would decorate the 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.909
 environment 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.060
 the sofa as you create a sofabed more 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.609
 pretty basic with two pillows beautiful 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.590
 which they composed very well and could 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.750
 nezinho is an object that we bought 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.270
 an antique fair and renovated there 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.400
 in the studio is a little girl who 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.560
 you can use both support 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.110
 to your desk as like a 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.860
 side table for expansion and easy to 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.780
 job 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.580
 we put a lamp on top of 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.770
 your computer to work with your 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.169
 more light is something that we have done with 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.180
 much affection is a yarn coated with 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.740
 danny's vision is on the giant to 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.590
 power to bring this light was 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.930
 missing the environment hook 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.539
 bags was already a hook you had 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.820
 You painted the flasher too. 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.550
 brings a feminine thing at the same time 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.169
 which illuminates and brings 11 is an object 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.080
 decorative is another decorative element 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.389
 for the environment and to complete 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.870
 power is to meet your other needs 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.450
 we used a lot of creativity 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.850
 and cheapest element I made up butt 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.880
 all of them inspirational and I think 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.280
 brings that joy more colors than I 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.530
 I used neutral colors and scored with 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.580
 more feminine and modern colors at the same time 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.790
 time 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.680
 It was beautiful home by the personality with 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.480
 Certainty is not a boss so I like it more 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.480
 what I'm looking very thing it here
