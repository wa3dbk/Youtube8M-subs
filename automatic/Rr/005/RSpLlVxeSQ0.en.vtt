00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
this is the highest number that Houston

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.410 
this is the highest number that Houston
has<00:03:26.299> ever<00:03:26.480> had<00:03:26.720> delay<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.910> history<00:03:29.390> of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
their franchise that's that's one of the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.590 
their franchise that's that's one of the
reasons<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:33.470> tough<00:03:33.970> because<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.360> don't

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
reasons that it's tough because I don't

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.970 
reasons that it's tough because I don't
think<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.930> need<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.110> teasers<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.769> think

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
think you need the teasers I think

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.500 
think you need the teasers I think
they're<00:03:37.100> going<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> cover<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:37.700> or<00:03:38.360> they're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
they're going to cover this or they're

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.910 
they're going to cover this or they're
not<00:03:38.660> going<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.840> cover<00:03:39.019> anything<00:03:39.350> they<00:03:39.650> win<00:03:39.799> it

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
not going to cover anything they win it

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.979 
not going to cover anything they win it
by<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> field<00:03:40.400> goal<00:03:40.489> right<00:03:40.910> right<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.420> may<00:03:41.930> be

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
by a field goal right right I may be

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.150 
by a field goal right right I may be
counter<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:43.250> may<00:03:43.910> be<00:03:43.970> contradicting<00:03:44.930> myself

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
counter I may be contradicting myself

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.620 
counter I may be contradicting myself
but<00:03:46.160> that's<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.609> way<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.730> kind<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.150> see<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.420> it's

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
but that's the way I kind of see it it's

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.270 
but that's the way I kind of see it it's
either<00:03:47.780> Houston<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.709> going<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.859> win<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:49.100> game

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
either Houston is going to win this game

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.860 
either Houston is going to win this game
by<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> field<00:03:49.820> goal<00:03:49.910> or<00:03:50.390> they're<00:03:50.720> going<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
by a field goal or they're going to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.390 
by a field goal or they're going to
comfortably<00:03:51.350> beat<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.799> spread<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.220> my

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
comfortably beat the spread in my

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.460 
comfortably beat the spread in my
opinion<00:03:52.790> right<00:03:53.269> now<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.480> think<00:03:53.630> they're<00:03:54.109> more

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
opinion right now I think they're more

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.229 
opinion right now I think they're more
motivated<00:03:55.070> on<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.280> end<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.609> beat<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.970> spread

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
motivated on the end to beat the spread

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.360 
motivated on the end to beat the spread
but<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.470> start<00:03:57.739> dancing<00:03:58.160> around<00:03:58.220> with

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
but you start dancing around with

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.250 
but you start dancing around with
teasers<00:03:58.820> like<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.239> never<00:03:59.570> quite<00:03:59.810> users

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
teasers like that I never quite users

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.199 
teasers like that I never quite users
I'm<00:04:00.530> not<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:01.040> best<00:04:01.280> person<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.820> give<00:04:01.910> any

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
I'm not the best person to give any

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.449 
I'm not the best person to give any
advice<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.950> but<00:04:03.950> they<00:04:04.250> held

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
advice on that but they held

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.020 
advice on that but they held
Jacksonville<00:04:06.100> 217<00:04:07.100> yards<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.609> total<00:04:07.760> offense

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
Jacksonville 217 yards of total offense

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.050 
Jacksonville 217 yards of total offense
in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> first<00:04:08.780> meeting<00:04:09.079> and<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:10.190> defense<00:04:10.820> is

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
in the first meeting and this defense is

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.229 
in the first meeting and this defense is
really<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> reason<00:04:12.109> that<00:04:12.320> Houston<00:04:12.920> is

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
really the reason that Houston is

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.520 
really the reason that Houston is
probably<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.359> best<00:04:14.540> team<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:14.870> football<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.500> my

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
probably the best team in football in my

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.090 
probably the best team in football in my
opinion<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.729> offense<00:04:17.390> has<00:04:17.600> been<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:18.289> little

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
opinion the offense has been a little

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.909 
opinion the offense has been a little
shaky<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.479> their<00:04:20.690> opportunity<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:21.769> get

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
shaky this is their opportunity to get

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.670 
shaky this is their opportunity to get
right<00:04:22.250> they<00:04:23.210> blew<00:04:23.539> out<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.720> Ravens<00:04:24.320> at<00:04:24.470> home

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
right they blew out the Ravens at home

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.260 
right they blew out the Ravens at home
they've<00:04:24.919> had<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.099> couple<00:04:25.400> other<00:04:25.610> impressive

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
they've had a couple other impressive

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.150 
they've had a couple other impressive
offensive<00:04:26.539> performance<00:04:27.169> at<00:04:27.319> home<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.979> before

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
offensive performance at home so before

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.490 
offensive performance at home so before
you<00:04:28.460> go<00:04:28.699> out<00:04:28.819> on<00:04:28.849> the<00:04:29.060> road<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.509> think<00:04:30.349> that's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
you go out on the road I think that's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.990 
you go out on the road I think that's
why<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.710> Texans<00:04:31.220> cover<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.580> number<00:04:31.849> but

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
why the Texans cover this number but

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.499 
why the Texans cover this number but
