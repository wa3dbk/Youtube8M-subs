not good I think too much of the

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.270 
not good I think too much of the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so from a fan perspective I do think

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.410 
so from a fan perspective I do think
that<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.770> become<00:02:10.979> less<00:02:11.130> interesting<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.970> do

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that it's become less interesting I do

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.540 
that it's become less interesting I do
think<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:12.959> always<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.860> chime<00:02:14.370> to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
think that people always like chime to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.679 
think that people always like chime to
those<00:02:14.670> days<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> high-stakes<00:02:15.540> poker

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
those days like the high-stakes poker

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.270 
those days like the high-stakes poker
days<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.349> stuff<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.620> look<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.040> as

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
days and stuff and they look to that as

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
days and stuff and they look to that as
when<00:02:17.430> poker<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.849> its<00:02:17.969> peak<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
when poker is at its peak and for that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.560 
when poker is at its peak and for that
to<00:02:19.110> change<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.800> think<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.580> wrong<00:02:20.790> approach<00:02:21.240> and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
to change I think the wrong approach and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.420 
to change I think the wrong approach and
I've<00:02:21.960> mentioned<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.320> before<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.250> one

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
I've mentioned this before is the one

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.330 
I've mentioned this before is the one
that<00:02:24.140> certain<00:02:25.140> people<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.710> know<00:02:25.800> some

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
that certain people like you know some

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.500 
that certain people like you know some
of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> members<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> TDA<00:02:27.120> or<00:02:27.270> whatever

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
of the members of the TDA or whatever

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.910 
of the members of the TDA or whatever
which<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.990> serious<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.650> need<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.830> take

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
which is this serious we need to take

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.490 
which is this serious we need to take
the<00:02:29.070> game<00:02:29.190> more<00:02:29.340> seriously<00:02:29.700> ah<00:02:29.820> ah<00:02:30.090> no<00:02:30.930> serious

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the game more seriously ah ah no serious

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.260 
the game more seriously ah ah no serious
serious<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> exactly<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> wrong<00:02:32.910> approach

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
serious is exactly the wrong approach

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.180 
serious is exactly the wrong approach
because<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:33.930> serious<00:02:34.380> does<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.800> bringing<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
because all serious does is bringing the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
you know he made it pretty clear this he

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.320 
you know he made it pretty clear this he
