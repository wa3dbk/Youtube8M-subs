 cutting-edge application and designs 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.199
 we will start with the correct preparation 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.199
 of the natural nail 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.660
 we are going to need antiseptic solution and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.350
 why pink solution 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.260
 zebra file 180 over 180 to file the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.690
 natural nail cuticle pusher and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 scissors 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.350
 we will also need our power and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.350
 our 1st 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 crystal tips and brush resin 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.350
 ladybug 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.590
 we will start disinfecting our hands 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.030
 and the hands of our client with 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.030
 antiseptic solution 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.650
 we will push cuticle very gently to 45 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.090
 degrees to avoid damaging the bed 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.130
 the nail of our client 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.830
 we will remove the dead cell around 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.900
 of our nail perfectly fine for 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.410
 avoid lifting our 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.410
 acrylic 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.180
 we will use our zebra lime 180 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.460
 over 180 to animate our muÃ±a 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.770
 I advise you to retire 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.369
 perfectly well the edges of our 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.640
 file to avoid cutting or hurting the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.580
 skin of our client we will remove the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.920
 natural shine of our nails 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.320
 gently on the sides and around 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
 the cuticle because that's another 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.170
 cause more of lifting the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 acrylic 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.690

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.180
 our manicure brush towards 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.040
 down to prevent dust from getting in 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.010
 our cuticles 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.640
 we will apply our nail dehydrator 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.640
 where 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.200
 we will apply it in a homogeneous way or 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.320
 couple to balance the ph of the nail 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.320
 natural 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.709

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.580
 measuring our tips from side to side 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:15.549
 without pressing and thus not cause a bad 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.549
 decision and application of the tips 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.990

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.950
 ladybug remembering to apply the resin 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.050

 we will cut and we will give an oval shape to 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.330
 our tips to reduce the time of 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.330
 filed 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.400
