see anything I really didn't think this
would<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.049> hard<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.410> like<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.799> them<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.250> my

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
would be so hard I like have them in my

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.789 
would be so hard I like have them in my
head<00:03:36.730> what<00:03:37.030> our<00:03:37.359> American<00:03:38.200> equivalent<00:03:38.470> of

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
head what our American equivalent of
