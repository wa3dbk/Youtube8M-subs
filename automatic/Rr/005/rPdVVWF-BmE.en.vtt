00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
taking on the male's as a general rule

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.920

I think it's just asking too much of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.830 
I think it's just asking too much of
them<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:23.159> being<00:01:23.460> said<00:01:23.700> though<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.450> feel

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
them that being said though I do feel

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.100 
them that being said though I do feel
there<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.110> an<00:01:25.259> exception<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.009> every<00:01:26.040> rule

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110

the boys pacer or Trotter well you know
I<00:03:20.729> think<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:21.629> actually<00:03:21.870> think<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.260> trotters

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
I think I actually think the trotters

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.719 
I think I actually think the trotters
probably<00:03:22.859> have<00:03:22.949> a<00:03:22.979> little<00:03:23.129> bit<00:03:23.250> easier<00:03:23.549> time

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.849 
did yeah I think it all depends on where
you<00:03:57.689> do<00:03:57.870> with<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.379> know<00:03:58.500> if<00:03:58.620> you're<00:03:58.739> in

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
a number of fillies that could beat

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.330 
a number of fillies that could beat
Colts<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.580> major<00:04:42.849> races<00:04:43.620> not<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.800> not<00:04:45.310> that

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
Colts and major races not that not that

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.510 
Colts and major races not that not that
we<00:04:45.550> actually<00:04:45.819> do<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.240> very<00:04:46.449> often<00:04:46.659> but<00:04:47.520> you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
we actually do it very often but you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.100 
we actually do it very often but you
know<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.759> kind<00:04:48.939> of<00:04:49.120> tend<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.389> protect<00:04:49.659> them

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
know you kind of tend to protect them

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.559 
know you kind of tend to protect them
you<00:04:51.069> know<00:04:51.159> it's<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> main<00:04:51.639> thing<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.939> suppose

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
you know it's the main thing I suppose

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.529 
you know it's the main thing I suppose
but<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.469> you<00:04:54.460> know<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.610> think<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.300> could<00:04:55.419> happen

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
but it you know I think it could happen

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.659 
but it you know I think it could happen
more<00:04:55.840> often<00:04:56.050> than<00:04:56.409> what<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.650> has<00:04:56.800> maybe<00:04:57.069> if<00:04:57.520> I

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
more often than what it has maybe if I

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.179 
more often than what it has maybe if I
went<00:04:57.819> to<00:04:58.060> New<00:04:58.240> Zealand<00:04:58.270> Australia<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.889> next

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
went to New Zealand Australia the next

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.649 
went to New Zealand Australia the next
five<00:05:00.400> months<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.909> watch<00:05:01.029> races<00:05:01.419> there<00:05:01.539> where
