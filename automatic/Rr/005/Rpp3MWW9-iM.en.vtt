their view I bought this the smooth

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
their view I bought this the smooth
internet<00:00:43.079> version<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:43.950> mostly

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
internet version because it's mostly

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.500 
internet version because it's mostly
targeted<00:00:45.030> towards<00:00:45.660> troubled<00:00:46.620> prone<00:00:47.010> skin<00:00:48.000> and

targeted towards troubled prone skin and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.080 
targeted towards troubled prone skin and
I'm<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.140> assume<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.920> troubled<00:00:50.700> pearl

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I'm gonna assume that troubled pearl

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
I'm gonna assume that troubled pearl
nice-lookin<00:00:51.960> means<00:00:52.140> acne<00:00:52.530> prone<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.370> yes<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
nice-lookin means acne prone so yes I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
nice-lookin means acne prone so yes I
got<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.079> suited<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:55.890> skin<00:00:56.399> type

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
got this because it suited my skin type

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.330 
got this because it suited my skin type
which<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.870> combination<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> acne<00:00:59.100> prone

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
which is by combination and acne prone

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
which is by combination and acne prone
skin<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> claims<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.920> claims<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
skin and what it claims it claims to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.460 
skin and what it claims it claims to
brighten<00:01:03.949> exfoliate<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.900> moisturize<00:01:06.900> and

brighten exfoliate and moisturize and
also<00:01:07.860> does<00:01:08.040> pore<00:01:08.340> cleansing<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
also does pore cleansing and I got this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.730

off of ebay for sixteen dollars and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
off of ebay for sixteen dollars and
that's<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.430> quite<00:01:14.610> pricey

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that's actually quite pricey

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
that's actually quite pricey
considering<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> fact<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.799> only<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.700> at

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

compared with the wonder pore I would

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.920 
compared with the wonder pore I would
rather<00:03:30.669> picked<00:03:31.060> up<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.329> your<00:03:31.479> pore<00:03:31.689> rather

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
than this toner so I only think this

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.129 
than this toner so I only think this
toner<00:03:36.159> is<00:03:36.310> okay<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:36.909> don't<00:03:37.629> think<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:37.989> would

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
toner is okay I don't think I would

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.500 
toner is okay I don't think I would
repurchase<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.919> I<00:03:38.949> think<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:39.549> only<00:03:39.729> more<00:03:40.239> of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
repurchase it I think it's only more of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.330 
repurchase it I think it's only more of
the<00:03:40.659> one<00:03:40.870> time<00:03:41.109> thing<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.530> try<00:03:41.739> since<00:03:41.979> I<00:03:42.099> heard

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340
