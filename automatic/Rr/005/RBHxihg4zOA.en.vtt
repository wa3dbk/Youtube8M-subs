 regains this important function again 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 this time idroid global process 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.640
 stage of the rarest opportunity in history 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 of humanity 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 because it will be a quelle of words 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.359
 you are the greatest distribution of wealth in 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 history and tests throughout

 the history of society handed out cash 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.180
 systems starting with the release of money 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 made of gold or silver for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 which then changed money only 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 substitute gold or silver 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 paper banknotes or copper coins 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.289
 after that the money supply is always 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 and constantly new 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.109
 but this ashes lay peacefully in the vaults in 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090

 silver, why should the able redeem 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.499
 gold and silver people provoke growth 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 their metal value will rise until 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.490
 thousands of your freedom and cost the whole 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 land volume 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.540
 Volyn money supply in this and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.579
 lies your opportunity this is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.070
 the greatest before dividing is rich in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.659
 human history if the government 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.250
 can't manage the money system 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 gas killed will do it for him 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.209
 how do you think the founding fathers of the united states 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.519
 said thomas jefferson 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.410
 Andrew Jackson himself if 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.599
 would they live today if they saw 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.730
 all that happened to their country 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.400
 the system they put down 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.310
 constitution so they think about our 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.610
 society what will happen to him how would they 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 us 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.470
 described can socialists called 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.150
 afraid of being taught by the communists on like that they 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.640
 we could even be arrested and imprisoned 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.230
 behind bars probably the communists you 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.120
 probably you know how things were with 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 finances voluntary act of 1792 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 first after the constitution he came out he 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.170
 said that for participating in currency forgery 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.930
 relies on the death penalty 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.819
 well, today we fake a lot of currency 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 prints dollars which they think 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.910
 cost nothing they knew what 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.859
 federal reserve banknotes when 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.190
 continental dollar flew into the tube 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.730
 they knew how dangerous inflation was sure that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.290
 jefferson and others said guys you 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.720
 you don't understand that once before 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.530
 happened that's why they led 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.299
 death penalty 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.700
 of moral quite so to speak 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.500
 Considerations Well, we legalized 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.540
 crafts of currency you and I fake currency 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.010
 cannot of course it is punishable by law 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.959
 so why can the government 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.959
 do and disobey the same law
