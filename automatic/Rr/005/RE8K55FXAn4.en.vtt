 so now I have one in some 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.210
 so the viage at the motives what 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.620
 I'm going to make this perrin a triangle and 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.000
 then bands that will follow the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.120
 triangle who have go around the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 square 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:07.300
 we start by sorting 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:10.060
 I put myself in my angle and there I 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:22.390
 will take it to make the slope of the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:23.830
 threesome here is the first band 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.060
 I put about the same length of 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.060
 blank of mass monteil 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.790
 There you go 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.909
 once you have finished putting the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.950
 marzipan think of well leaning on the 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.959
 edges with your nails to be sure 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.530
 that he adhered well to happening now 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.590
 we go through the triangle there I chose 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.159
 to use my pure painting with a 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.159
 little brush I just filled 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.220
 so I leave it blank because I 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.220
 love me and i'm going to do that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.689
 waiting for the first color 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.230

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.409
 first rose and with white in a 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.120
 small container to have led so 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:18.109
 more or less according to a temple intensity 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:21.959
 wanted so we mix one that stays 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.740
 having to reach no 11 mix 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.740
 former 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:47.410
 that's it and we dried it once 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.650
 to do is to have the Scotch tape removed 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:56.830
 so in l1 all gently banda presents 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.830
 ravaged the roof 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.559
 so if it's a little drooling you want 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.659
