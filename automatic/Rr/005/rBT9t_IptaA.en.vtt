a<00:00:45.539> very<00:00:45.899> simple<00:00:46.350> tweak<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> said<00:00:47.100> any

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a very simple tweak and like I said any

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
a very simple tweak and like I said any
folder<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
folder that you make you can have this

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.170 
folder that you make you can have this
functionality<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:50.910> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
functionality and so here we go make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
functionality and so here we go make
another<00:00:51.210> folder<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.100> see

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
another folder here and as you can see

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
another folder here and as you can see
we<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.430> reminders<00:00:54.120> set<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> first

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we have reminders set in the first

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.080 
we have reminders set in the first
position<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> open<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.520> folder<00:00:56.789> up

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
position well if I open that folder up

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
position well if I open that folder up
and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.480> move<00:00:57.690> Instagram<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> first

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and then I move Instagram to the first

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
and then I move Instagram to the first
position<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.489> see<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.910> changes<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
position you can see that it changes and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
position you can see that it changes and
indeed<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> same

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
indeed it will have the same

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
indeed it will have the same
functionality<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.750> utilities<00:01:04.229> folder

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
functionality as the utilities folder

now there are some options for tap tap

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
now there are some options for tap tap
folder<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> settings<00:01:08.369> app

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
have tap tap folder right here we do

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
have tap tap folder right here we do
have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> couple<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> different<00:01:15.180> options<00:01:15.479> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

have a couple of different options we
can<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.350> reversed<00:01:16.860> behavior<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
can have reversed behavior so if you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
can have reversed behavior so if you
want<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> switch<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.500> to

right here we have this single app
taking<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> entire<00:01:35.250> space<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> folder

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
taking up the entire space of the folder

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.929 
taking up the entire space of the folder
well<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.170> turn<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.740> keep<00:01:38.100> folder<00:01:38.460> preview

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
well if we turn on keep folder preview

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
well if we turn on keep folder preview
you'll<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> normal<00:01:41.130> folder

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you'll see it just like a normal folder

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
you'll see it just like a normal folder
and<00:01:41.909> obviously<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.509> didn't<00:01:42.930> work<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.320> now

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and obviously that didn't work right now

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.670 
and obviously that didn't work right now
Oh<00:01:44.540> respring<00:01:45.540> required<00:01:45.930> okay<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.350> i'm<00:01:46.590> not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
Oh respring required okay so i'm not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.960 
Oh respring required okay so i'm not
going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> demonstrate<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
going to demonstrate that one for you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.310 
going to demonstrate that one for you
guys<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> guys<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
guys right now but you guys get the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
guys right now but you guys get the
point<00:01:49.500> it'll<00:01:49.710> keep<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> standard<00:01:50.579> preview

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
point it'll keep the standard preview

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
point it'll keep the standard preview
folder<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.770> we

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
folder if you have that on and then we

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
folder if you have that on and then we
also<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.340> double<00:01:53.729> tap<00:01:53.970> timeout<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.110> that's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
also have a double tap timeout so that's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
also have a double tap timeout so that's
basically<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.219> amount<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.299> between

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
basically the amount of time in between

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
basically the amount of time in between
your<00:01:58.170> taps<00:01:58.469> before<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.610> times<00:01:59.969> out

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
your taps before it actually times out

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.420 
your taps before it actually times out
and<00:02:00.299> registers<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.200> single<00:02:01.500> tap<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.219> keep

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and registers it as a single tap so keep

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
and registers it as a single tap so keep
that<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.640> mind<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.840> few<00:02:03.869> options<00:02:04.409> in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that in mind but just a few options in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
that in mind but just a few options in
here<00:02:04.560> nothing<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> special<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.030> but

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
here nothing really special going on but

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
here nothing really special going on but
this<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.110> simple<00:02:07.469> tweak<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> could

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
this is a very simple tweak and it could

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.279 
this is a very simple tweak and it could
come<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.459> handy<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.479> there's<00:02:10.020> just

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
come in handy for you if there's just

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.589 
come in handy for you if there's just
one<00:02:10.560> app<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.310> single<00:02:11.730> folder<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.209> use

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
one app in a single folder that you use

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.820 
one app in a single folder that you use
a<00:02:12.629> lot<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.530> just

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a lot and you just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560

want<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.280> hide<00:02:14.520> away<00:02:14.730> any<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
want to kind of hide away any of the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.390 
want to kind of hide away any of the
other<00:02:15.720> ones<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> just

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
launched like the calculator app maybe I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.720 
launched like the calculator app maybe I
don't<00:02:19.350> use<00:02:19.560> all<00:02:19.800> these<00:02:19.980> other<00:02:20.190> apps<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.580> here

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

and I just use calculator app well it's
a<00:02:22.650> good<00:02:22.770> way<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> hide<00:02:23.160> them<00:02:23.370> away<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.850> then

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
a good way to hide them away and then

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.300 
a good way to hide them away and then
still<00:02:24.510> keep<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.170> tap<00:02:25.470> functionality
