00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi guys today will support a big one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 challenge already a couple of days ago 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.099
 asked on facebook 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 if I could recreate the marion tutorial 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.769
 cotillard 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.230
 but maybe my pronunciation is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.570
 completely wrong 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 so correct me without problems 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.289
 practically the batman actress the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 dark knight and also of inception 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 for others there is very French America 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.040
 very famous currently i have to say that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 looking at some photos they go by the thousand 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 make up are quite simple and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 elegant usually has eyes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.590
 very intense dark but rarely uses i 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.760
 brown tones prefer rather 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 sari removes bronze and matt brown 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.079
 but sometimes we can also see it 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.020
 with light lips from the lips 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 rosÃ© a little on plum 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.070
 I didn't see black smokey in her 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.549
 particularly intense but all 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.799
 quite natural or at least even if a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.650
 slightly more accentuated, however, on brown not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.600
 he absolutely used black 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.580
 I saw some of his photos and say the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 look that inspired me that you will see 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 scroll up here in the video only 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 quite natural and wearable by everyone 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.400
 not just age not just jade me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 he proposed this tutorial but also 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 from many other people of course 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.049
 keep in mind that I don't have his 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 face but mostly I don't have his 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.979
 form with eyes because she is a form of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 very particular eyes a little more 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 roundish of the love you see is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.420
 strange because my aunt bastard 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 quite roundish therefore it tends to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.229
 to stretch a lot and therefore to contrast 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.270
 this roundness of your eyes 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.329
 I have stretched 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.490
 i'm more enough maybe not like her 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.920
 this trick could be recreated 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.380
 also with a slightly bronze bull 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.390
 the clearer I chose this darker 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.769
 because I find it much better with mine 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.140
 colors 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.610
 keep in mind that I am not you I do not have 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 its shape with eyes I don't have its own 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 eye color but I tried anyway 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.450
 recreate his group 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.819
 I hope this video can be there 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.680
 useful and that reproduces this trick 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.840
 because a very elegant make-up 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.269
 quite evening is very simple 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.090
 I think I already hope for this 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.579
 makeup can help you and send you a 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.260
 pregnant kiss I leave you at the tutorial e 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.560
 not bronzed pencils on the eyelid 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.560
 mobile 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.500
 and faded it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.370
 with an intensive black pencil 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.800
 the hairline because she has 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 a very very dark look and the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.370
 crime 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.680
 just a black pencil is enough below 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.810
 smoke the arches with a hazel color 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.140
 and now they slowly soften over the whole 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.750
 movable eyelid a very shimmer brown 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.750
 with bronzed reflections and copper 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.400
 fades brown under mat 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.260
 away along the natural line of mine 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 eye blur the same brown too 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.740
 over it 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.020
 with the same black pencil used before 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.930
 intensify attachment of the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.409
 cd and he said it also in the internal rhyme 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.409
 eye 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.410
 finally mascara and the eyes are finished 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.880
 also on the cheeks usually uses tones 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.740
 very neutral as you can see from 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.580
 this photo is simply a blush 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.920
 caught and then some contouring then 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.820
 I will also use a caught blush and will use it 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.620
 this one from the ginger bar I wear anyway 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.340
 below in the information box all the 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.340
 products and I'm using 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.260
 I take the butter for a moment and they put it there 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.180
 previously from the lips then 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.040
 usually in your photos you use 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.410
 always something very natural 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.560
 simply a big transparent a 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.610
 little pink or even just a butter 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.890
 lips will be fine I put this 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.370
 Lipstick nic has a tone a bit 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.500
 lighter than my lips it gives me 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.980
 however that very rosy effect 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.750
 cute is also natural and so 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.210
 I distribute better with my fingertips 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.720
 to make it much more natural too 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.720
 less share 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.210
 and we can say that luca is over thanks 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.210
 for watching the video and the next one
