00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
out intentionally it's just they just

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
out intentionally it's just they just
grow<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.950> fast<00:01:20.090> for<00:01:21.090> example<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> cut<00:01:21.930> them

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
today no later than a week they would
still<00:01:25.110> probably<00:01:25.320> look<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.070> again

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
still probably look like this again

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.330 
still probably look like this again
that's<00:01:27.360> how<00:01:27.450> fast<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.990> grow<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.860> sometimes<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that's how fast they grow so sometimes I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.300 
cracked a little bit you can't see that
it<00:04:02.269> cracked<00:04:02.659> a<00:04:02.780> little<00:04:03.019> bit<00:04:03.230> on<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:03.980> middle

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
it cracked a little bit on in the middle

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.289 
it cracked a little bit on in the middle
so<00:04:05.120> I'm<00:04:05.329> probably<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:06.109> uh<00:04:06.579> yeah<00:04:07.579> it<00:04:08.090> didn't

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
so I'm probably just uh yeah it didn't

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.970 
so I'm probably just uh yeah it didn't
crack<00:04:08.480> down<00:04:08.689> that<00:04:08.930> low<00:04:09.169> it's<00:04:09.439> just<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:09.799> up

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
crack down that low it's just like up

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.360 
crack down that low it's just like up
here<00:04:10.010> somewhere<00:04:10.609> I'm<00:04:11.389> gonna<00:04:11.569> cut<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.930> off<00:04:12.370> okay

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
here somewhere I'm gonna cut it off okay

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.210 
here somewhere I'm gonna cut it off okay
and<00:04:13.579> just<00:04:13.609> start<00:04:14.090> from<00:04:14.359> fresh<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:15.039> mean<00:04:16.039> it's

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and just start from fresh I mean it's

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.039 
and just start from fresh I mean it's
gonna<00:04:16.430> it's<00:04:16.759> gonna<00:04:16.970> grow<00:04:17.239> back<00:04:17.269> fast<00:04:17.750> anyway

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
gonna it's gonna grow back fast anyway

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.629 
gonna it's gonna grow back fast anyway
so<00:04:18.199> it<00:04:18.500> doesn't<00:04:18.530> even<00:04:18.829> really<00:04:18.949> matter<00:04:19.099> I<00:04:19.370> can

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639
