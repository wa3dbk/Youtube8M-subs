00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 the lions club here is the taste of new year 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.679
 Today I'm going to talk about dry shot and 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 basketball use do not know there one 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.840
 Portuguese but these are these hoods 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.740
 which has a fuse place a base 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.320
 plastic silicone and absorbs the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.310
 impact of the teacher is in the practice of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.730
 shot 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.820
 one of the most important things is how 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:45.649
 You're the trigger man. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 you have several situations have to 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 divert the gun a bit when you are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 taking out there are people in that in europe 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.270
 and it will be very common that right- 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.460
 team is going out for a while 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.149
 left down your problem on your 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.369
 finger is not usually in the south of the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.930
 country has also been targeted 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.380
 usually not your finger 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 Okay, this is very important for you to practice. 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 to dry until you notice that the sight does not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 It is moving when you talk if you 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:42.150
 if you when you usually talk 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 people have compensated is doing this 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.880
 move here doing this several times 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 because if you do not even do this 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.079
 move here to be you 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.060
 have to make ten times more spacious 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.460
 job than shooting at the shooting club 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.939
 in my opinion until you get the hang of it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.860
 of your trigger that the gun will not 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.259
 move when you are shooting and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.420
 this has to be exactly the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.509
 same cross procedure is with ammunition 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.509
 real 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.120
 but every guns with gas crisis uncle 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.000
 different then you have to get used to it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.340
 if the water is not in itself it is not enough 6 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.370
 promised land ten shots ago and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.520
 Ailments has taken control of the light to do 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.820
 This is what you're doing until you're here. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:38.400
 proficient in the trigger and do not 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:43.680
 I am calm being supported here had no 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:50.430
 backed when when you should 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 use these 9mm within 40 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.610
 but when you should use I your 11 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.770
 Central firearms are not as 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.620
 this is necessary unless the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.410
 manufacturer recommends whether or not 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.430
 I recommend doing the dry shot you 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:14.510
 uses fpf will have the same property as 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.510
 ammunition on the island under the impact of 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:29.610
 south on 22 mainly is not 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 recommended to make a 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.070
 22 because it prompts the edge in 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.710
 center when you have a firearm 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:43.320
 central ooo percursor will reach 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.470
 a false means of nothing has nothing then 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 it can break a spring but it points 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.530
 it will not be modified at 22 is not 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.380
 the case points number 2 when hitting the edge 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.430
 the camera that may damage the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.460
 then the firing pin 22 you have to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.060
 have some profession there to absorb the 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:13.310
 The impact person I use teaches us that 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.310
 the use of bushing of wall drills 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.239
 has a size larger than the number four 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.970
 that in the united states that fits 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.040
 exactly within the chamber 92 of the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.139
 156 dispatch anxiety intends to play 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.569
 strong to be totally destroyed 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:33.449
 and you have to keep turning it is annoying 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.150
 but it's trouble on the roads way you 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.840
 You can buy a cigar box. 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.960
 and throws all day to dry 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.849
 if you always want their rules 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.159
 to see if security is not it the 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.349
 should be concerned about ammunition 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.860
 real and everything else 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.199
 I will make a video about security 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.210
 water bridge always a fun that does not 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.919
 There's nobody to keep you from training. 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.319
 is to play with me already in the middle of your 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.080
 home because you can have someone else's 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:08.750
 side of a wall but anyway 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.659
 and you can train with a must train 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.500
 for the ride that's it folks 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.500
 a hug thank you
