00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.279
 friends let's see how the vs works 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.950
 that as you all know the 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.470
 electronic device to maintain the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.320
 energy in our computer when it 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.090
 cut the normal supply we have it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.360
 lit as you can see 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.260
 we do not have 220 fed by 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.360
 this cable 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.310
 as you can obviously appreciate 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 get feed power of the bs 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.250
 and here we go 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.520
 to the computer that we want to protect from 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.560
 some possible power cut 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.010
 then we will proceed to turn on the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.829
 computer for you to see how 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.449
 this works 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.449
 there we have on 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.040
 ah 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.070
 As you can see, this is starting 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.440
 all this is happening in this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.280
 moment fueled by the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280
 you see 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.910
 take we have the service 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.810
 if we go to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.649
 and navigate a bit so we can see it in 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.649
 functioning 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830
 Y 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.780
 and now we are going to what we live 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.000
 or can we produce the cost 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.620
 electric power at the moment of 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.170
 celebrating our already operational 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.990
 celebrating our discs to what 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.950
 many surely to leave so 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.730
 let's disconnect the cable 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.730
 feeding 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.670
 we took 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.830
 how can they listen to lopez and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.200
 stabilizing the one that there is a cut of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.670
 electric power beeps 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.670
 every 10 seconds or so 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.210
 let's stop this to create a method 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.280
 instructs there yes 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.140
 here again he will listen to you 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.950
 that the bs warns us that a cut 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.950
 electric power 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.460
 therefore what do we do 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.540
 we close our our windows in 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.540
 the work we are doing 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.650
 and turn off the equipment 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.770
 if we did not have any data loss 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.500
 No damage to our hard drive 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.600
 no harm to the computer 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.840
 that's all friends I hope you have them 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.840
 liked
