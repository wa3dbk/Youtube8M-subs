00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
going to make the sauce itself by

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.340 
going to make the sauce itself by
chopping<00:00:33.670> up<00:00:33.729> an<00:00:33.879> onion<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:34.449> garlic<00:00:34.929> and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
chopping up an onion and garlic and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.689 
chopping up an onion and garlic and
Swiss<00:00:35.589> on<00:00:35.679> that<00:00:35.829> off<00:00:36.010> in<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.159> pan<00:00:36.339> with<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.519> shot

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290 

so<00:00:42.770> our<00:00:42.920> onions<00:00:43.220> start<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.580> sweat<00:00:43.790> off<00:00:43.940> we<00:00:44.150> can

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
so our onions start to sweat off we can

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.579 
so our onions start to sweat off we can
slice<00:00:44.660> our<00:00:44.960> potatoes<00:00:45.350> nice<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:45.740> thick

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
between your land mixture is you either

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.630 
between your land mixture is you either
need<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.769> cook<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.039> for<00:00:55.100> an<00:00:55.190> awful<00:00:55.489> long<00:00:55.609> time

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
need to cook it for an awful long time

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.220 
need to cook it for an awful long time
to<00:00:55.879> make<00:00:56.149> sure<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.329> potato<00:00:56.600> cooks<00:00:56.839> through<00:00:57.079> or

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230

strip off all the leaves from that and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.850 
strip off all the leaves from that and

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
course classically and we'll stack our

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:33.520 
course classically and we'll stack our
needs<00:01:32.690> aubergine<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.200> we're<00:01:33.289> not<00:01:33.380> going<00:01:33.500> to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
needs aubergine so we're not going to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.410 
needs aubergine so we're not going to
slice<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.369> layer<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.729> I'm<00:01:35.060> just<00:01:35.270> going<00:01:35.390> to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
slice it and layer it I'm just going to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.289 
slice it and layer it I'm just going to
dice<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.840> up<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:35.960> we'll<00:01:36.319> fry<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.619> off

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.610 

the<00:01:41.810> overeating<00:01:42.080> can<00:01:42.200> all<00:01:42.290> go<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.409> as<00:01:42.590> well

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
the overeating can all go in as well

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.469 
the overeating can all go in as well
attend<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.250> heat<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.640> pan<00:01:43.670> right<00:01:44.150> up

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
attend the heat of the pan right up

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
because we don't want the ocean to stew
