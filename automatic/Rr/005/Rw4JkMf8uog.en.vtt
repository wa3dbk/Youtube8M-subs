 well armed jihadists 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 close to the Turkish border town of boars

 considered the last Kursk bastion on 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 north of Syria

 they say that quickly and military 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.470
 interference is unlikely Kurdish 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.990
 formations mobilized all their forces 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.360
 to protect the boars themselves 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.079

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.450
 residents 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.170
 if the city is in the hands of militants
