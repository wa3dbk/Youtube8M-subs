the<00:00:00.450> big<00:00:01.050> question<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:01.800> today's<00:00:02.280> video<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.909> the

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
the big question of today's video is the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.240 
the big question of today's video is the
sprinting<00:00:04.830> increased<00:00:05.700> height<00:00:06.649> well<00:00:07.649> before

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
sprinting increased height well before

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.400 
sprinting increased height well before
we<00:00:08.370> get<00:00:08.490> started<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.179> should<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.870> not

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
we get started you should know that not

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
we get started you should know that not
everyone<00:00:10.740> understands<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> same<00:00:11.940> thing<00:00:12.269> when

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
everyone understands the same thing when

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.990 
everyone understands the same thing when
we<00:00:12.630> talk<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:12.870> sprinting<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.639> know<00:00:14.790> when<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
we talk about sprinting you know when I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.670 
we talk about sprinting you know when I
would<00:00:15.210> ask<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.630> friend<00:00:15.809> if<00:00:16.109> he<00:00:16.230> wants<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.560> go

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
would ask a friend if he wants to go

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.490 
would ask a friend if he wants to go
sprinting<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.430> me<00:00:17.690> chances<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.869> he

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
sprinting with me chances are he

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.849 
sprinting with me chances are he
imagined<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> different<00:00:20.490> exercise<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.359> did

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
imagined a different exercise and I did

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.620 
imagined a different exercise and I did
so<00:00:22.859> let<00:00:23.010> me<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.250> quickly<00:00:23.609> cover<00:00:23.970> these<00:00:24.240> three

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so let me just quickly cover these three

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.080 
so let me just quickly cover these three
variations<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.380> sprinting<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
variations of sprinting the first one is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
variations of sprinting the first one is
simply<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.960> run<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> short<00:00:28.500> distance<00:00:28.800> really

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
simply you run a short distance really

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.560 
simply you run a short distance really
fast<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.570> run<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> only<00:00:31.109> once<00:00:32.120> the<00:00:33.120> second

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
fast but you run it only once the second

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
fast but you run it only once the second
variation<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.649> run<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> short<00:00:35.160> distance

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
variation is you run a short distance

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
variation is you run a short distance
really<00:00:35.820> fast<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> longer

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
really fast and then you take a longer

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
really fast and then you take a longer
break<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.399> 5<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> 10<00:00:39.090> minutes<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.770> then<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
break of 5 to 10 minutes and then you

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.479 
break of 5 to 10 minutes and then you
sprint<00:00:41.219> again<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> third<00:00:43.649> variation<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
sprint again and the third variation is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.799 
sprint again and the third variation is
interval<00:00:45.149> training<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.270> cover

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
interval training we don't have to cover

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
interval training we don't have to cover
all<00:00:48.960> three<00:00:49.500> variations<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.520> because

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
all three variations here because

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.670 
all three variations here because
actually<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.440> variation<00:00:53.190> number<00:00:53.309> two<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
actually it's variation number two that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080 
actually it's variation number two that
helps<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> most<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.430> increasing<00:00:56.969> your

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
helps you the most in increasing your

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.139 
helps you the most in increasing your
height<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> growing<00:00:57.930> taller<00:00:59.149> sprinting

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
height and growing taller sprinting

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.349 
height and growing taller sprinting
variation<00:01:00.600> number<00:01:00.719> two<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.359> sprint

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
variation number two where you sprint

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
variation number two where you sprint
really<00:01:03.809> fast<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.320> fast<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> short

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
really fast as fast as you can a short

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
really fast as fast as you can a short
distance<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.659> between<00:01:06.990> 50<00:01:07.560> meters<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
distance can be between 50 meters and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.210 
distance can be between 50 meters and
100<00:01:08.250> meters<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.260> then<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> take<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> break<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
100 meters and then you take a break of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.899 
100 meters and then you take a break of
5<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> 10<00:01:11.850> minutes<00:01:12.150> depending<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:13.729> on<00:01:14.729> your

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
5 to 10 minutes depending on on your

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.770 
5 to 10 minutes depending on on your
level<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> fitness

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
level of fitness

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.109 
level of fitness
and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> sprint<00:01:17.009> again<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and then you sprint again and this is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
and then you sprint again and this is
sort<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.259> weight<00:01:19.680> training<00:01:19.950> where<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
sort of like weight training where you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
sort of like weight training where you
perform<00:01:20.700> highly<00:01:21.479> intensive<00:01:22.110> sets<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
perform highly intensive sets and you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
perform highly intensive sets and you
repeat<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.939> over<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.900> again<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
repeat them over and over again to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.330 
repeat them over and over again to
increase<00:01:25.860> performance<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:29.070> perform

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
increase performance if you can perform

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.990 
increase performance if you can perform
at<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.210> exercise<00:01:31.369> several<00:01:32.369> times<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.970> week

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
at this exercise several times a week

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.960 
at this exercise several times a week
then<00:01:33.990> sprinting<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.430> help<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
then sprinting really can help you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
then sprinting really can help you
increase<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.810> height<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.829> help<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
increase your height and can help you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.749 
increase your height and can help you
grow<00:01:38.430> taller<00:01:39.920> another<00:01:40.920> big<00:01:41.340> question<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.240> why

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
grow taller another big question is why

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.160 
grow taller another big question is why
why<00:01:44.759> does<00:01:45.149> sprinting<00:01:45.899> increase<00:01:46.320> height

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
why does sprinting increase height

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.660 
why does sprinting increase height
obviously<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.399> take

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
obviously I don't just want you to take

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.620 
obviously I don't just want you to take
my<00:01:51.119> word<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> say<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> works

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
my word for it when I say this works

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
my word for it when I say this works
instead<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> give<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
instead I just want to give you a really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.749 
instead I just want to give you a really
short<00:01:57.149> explanation<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> science

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
short explanation of kind of the science

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
short explanation of kind of the science
behind<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:01.610> because<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:03.329> order<00:02:03.570> for

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
behind all of this because in order for

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.069 
behind all of this because in order for
you<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> grow<00:02:04.770> taller<00:02:05.070> after<00:02:05.610> puberty<00:02:06.079> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
you to grow taller after puberty you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.400 
you to grow taller after puberty you
need<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> achieve<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> following<00:02:08.160> two<00:02:08.700> things

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
need to achieve the following two things

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.230 
need to achieve the following two things
one<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.670> lengthen

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
one you have to lengthen

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.420 
one you have to lengthen
your<00:02:12.330> limbs<00:02:12.600> either<00:02:13.380> your<00:02:13.650> legs<00:02:13.980> or<00:02:14.310> your

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
your limbs either your legs or your

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.130 
your limbs either your legs or your
spinal<00:02:14.730> column<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.660> best<00:02:16.470> would<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.770> both<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
spinal column and best would be both and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.410 
spinal column and best would be both and
second<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.340> stimulate<00:02:20.640> your<00:02:21.120> body

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
second you have to stimulate your body

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.020 
second you have to stimulate your body
to<00:02:21.810> naturally<00:02:22.530> release<00:02:23.100> more<00:02:23.730> growth

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to naturally release more growth

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.290 
to naturally release more growth
hormones<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:27.090> here<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.810> big<00:02:28.320> takeaway

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
hormones now here is the big takeaway

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.030 
hormones now here is the big takeaway
sprinting<00:02:30.300> helps<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.050> both<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
sprinting helps you with both of the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.330 
sprinting helps you with both of the
just<00:02:32.790> mentioned<00:02:33.050> criteria<00:02:34.160> lengthens<00:02:35.160> your

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
just mentioned criteria lengthens your

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.160 
just mentioned criteria lengthens your
limbs<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.000> also<00:02:36.180> stimulates<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:36.930> body

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
limbs and it also stimulates your body

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.670 
limbs and it also stimulates your body
to<00:02:37.500> release<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.580> growth<00:02:38.760> hormones<00:02:39.680> because

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
to release more growth hormones because

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040 
to release more growth hormones because
when<00:02:41.340> you're<00:02:41.490> sprinting<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> push

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
when you're sprinting you have to push

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.670 
when you're sprinting you have to push
your<00:02:43.230> body<00:02:43.440> off<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.830> ground<00:02:44.210> really<00:02:45.210> hard<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
your body off the ground really hard and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
your body off the ground really hard and
you<00:02:46.680> also<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.220> pull<00:02:47.460> your<00:02:47.640> knees<00:02:47.880> up

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you also have to pull your knees up

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.050 
you also have to pull your knees up
really<00:02:48.570> high<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:50.010> order<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.400> keep<00:02:50.580> up<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
really high in order to keep up with the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.380 
really high in order to keep up with the
speed<00:02:51.770> in<00:02:52.770> other<00:02:52.920> words<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.550> taking<00:02:54.090> long

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
speed in other words you're taking long

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.040 
speed in other words you're taking long
strides<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.320> these<00:02:56.130> long<00:02:56.460> strides<00:02:56.970> or<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> form

strides and these long strides or a form
of<00:02:58.170> stretching<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.800> legs<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:02.700> if<00:03:03.000> you're

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
of stretching your legs now if you're

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.420 
of stretching your legs now if you're
already<00:03:03.390> an<00:03:03.780> adult<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.800> at<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.160> point

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
already an adult then at this point

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.650 
already an adult then at this point
we're<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.290> lengthening<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> actual<00:03:07.920> bones

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
we're not lengthening the actual bones

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660 
we're not lengthening the actual bones
this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> really<00:03:10.380> impossible<00:03:10.980> because<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
this is really impossible because the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.150 
this is really impossible because the
bones<00:03:11.880> are<00:03:12.120> solid<00:03:12.390> once<00:03:12.840> you're<00:03:13.470> done<00:03:13.680> growing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
bones are solid once you're done growing

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.250 
bones are solid once you're done growing
once<00:03:14.520> you're<00:03:14.670> past<00:03:15.030> puberty<00:03:15.360> your<00:03:15.750> bones<00:03:16.050> are

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
once you're past puberty your bones are

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.520 
once you're past puberty your bones are
solid<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.830> they<00:03:16.980> cannot<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:18.530> lengthened

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
solid and they cannot be lengthened

bones we have little spaces and by

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.040 
bones we have little spaces and by
stretching<00:03:26.310> your<00:03:26.550> legs<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.210> can<00:03:27.360> make<00:03:27.570> use<00:03:28.020> of

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
stretching your legs you can make use of

stretching your legs you can make use of
these<00:03:28.500> spaces<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.780> lengthen<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.810> relax<00:03:31.170> a

these spaces and lengthen your relax a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.830 
these spaces and lengthen your relax a
bit<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:35.180> finally<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:37.530> all<00:03:37.770> types<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.840> intense

exercise<00:03:40.730> stimulates<00:03:41.730> your<00:03:42.180> body<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:43.140> release

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
exercise stimulates your body to release

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.090 
exercise stimulates your body to release
or<00:03:43.770> growth<00:03:44.040> hormones<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:45.980> sprinting<00:03:46.980> is

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
or growth hormones and sprinting is

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.350 
or growth hormones and sprinting is
really<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.700> classic

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
really the classic

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.990 
really the classic
exercise<00:03:48.990> you<00:03:49.770> know<00:03:49.920> for<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.460> this<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
exercise you know for for this kind of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.170 
exercise you know for for this kind of
purpose<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:52.190> seriously<00:03:53.190> sprinting

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
purpose and seriously sprinting

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.600 
purpose and seriously sprinting
measurably<00:03:55.170> increases<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> amount<00:03:56.430> of

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
measurably increases the amount of

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.940 
measurably increases the amount of
growth<00:03:56.910> hormones<00:03:57.450> your<00:03:57.900> pitcher<00:03:58.470> or<00:03:58.530> gland

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
growth hormones your pitcher or gland

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.950 
growth hormones your pitcher or gland
releases<00:03:59.220> into<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> system<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.720> last

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
releases into the system and the last

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.810 
releases into the system and the last
question<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.680> when<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:04.950> cover<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.460> this<00:04:05.580> video

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
question of when I cover in this video

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.680 
question of when I cover in this video
is<00:04:06.360> um<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.790> do<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.300> have<00:04:09.540> to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
is um so is that it do you just have to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.970 
is um so is that it do you just have to
go<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.020> sprint<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.590> there<00:04:11.100> something<00:04:11.520> missing

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
go and sprint is there something missing

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.210 
go and sprint is there something missing
well<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.820> most<00:04:15.000> important<00:04:15.570> thing<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.990> that

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
well the most important thing is that

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.380 
well the most important thing is that
sprinting<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.340> just<00:04:17.609> part<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.150> bigger

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
sprinting is just part of a bigger

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.860 
sprinting is just part of a bigger
picture<00:04:18.720> okay<00:04:19.549> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.669> combine<00:04:21.270> regular

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
picture okay if you combine regular

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.740 
picture okay if you combine regular
sprinting<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.060> described<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.690> this

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
sprinting as I have described it in this

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.000 
sprinting as I have described it in this
video<00:04:25.169> without

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
video without

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.300 
video without
stretching<00:04:26.490> exercises<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:29.010> easily

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
stretching exercises then you can easily

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.250 
stretching exercises then you can easily
increase<00:04:30.030> your<00:04:30.210> height<00:04:30.450> by<00:04:30.630> two<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:31.050> four

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
increase your height by two to four

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.610 
increase your height by two to four
inches<00:04:32.000> within<00:04:33.020> within<00:04:34.020> two<00:04:34.350> months<00:04:34.500> really

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
inches within within two months really

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.530 
inches within within two months really
it's<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:38.040> matter<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.540> regularly

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
it's just a matter of regularly

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.610 
it's just a matter of regularly
exercising<00:04:41.450> consistently<00:04:42.450> exercising<00:04:43.380> and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
exercising consistently exercising and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.240 
exercising consistently exercising and
doing<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.700> right<00:04:45.440> exercises<00:04:46.440> sprinting<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
doing the right exercises sprinting is

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.450 
doing the right exercises sprinting is
certainly<00:04:47.610> one<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.910> them<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:49.980> can

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
certainly one of them if that it can

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.380 
certainly one of them if that it can
lengthen<00:04:50.880> your<00:04:50.970> legs<00:04:51.710> but<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:54.120> grow
