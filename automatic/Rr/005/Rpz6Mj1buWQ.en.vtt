00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.430
 loneliness pointed civil protection 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.380
 municipal on Saturday and he already in the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.820
 morning the high swell began to be seen 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.170
 at noon but the most part more 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.289
 complicated was in the early morning of 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.470
 Sunday because it was when they received the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.500
 greater amount of swell and basically 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.480
 in the northern part in our municipality and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.170
 talking about beaches that is caleta de 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.020

 same Sunday as we verify it can be 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 that the community or the tourist beach 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 most affected because it was the loneliness in 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.680
 where the waves then removed the furniture 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.900
 up the street but there is the street 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.330
 principal 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.430
 kitchen utensils were lost 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.130
 refrigerators stoves that also 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.260
 they were dragged and obviously 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.480
 there was no way to cater to tourism that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.420
 from a day before they had there then 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.400
 the tourists to see this situation then 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.530

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.010
 Sunday morning this has affected the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.540
 80% of the towns of the municipality already 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.390
 that the force of the waves has taken 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.490
 from material to damaged part of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.310
 its infrastructure with the route that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 it was done because it was found that in all 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.940
 the beach on the entire municipal coast of 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.090

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 Greater than benevolence 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.420
 then for example time there garden 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.260
 because the lobster got the water 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.120
 is almost to access and got to the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.550
