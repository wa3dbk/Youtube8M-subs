00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.150
 hello today i will tell you how you can 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 revive recover battery 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.360
 car 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.730
 bosch or mouth modern entered into 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 to a mouth that is not serviced like that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.760
 type of cover you removed and from I only 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 that someone already brought him from the street 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.720
 tried to pick failed to open and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 threw away 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 so he found out the problems that one 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 the bank of some horseradish is not filled 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.160
 electrolyte whether this skills sang whether 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 it's a defect 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 factory of such a distinguished brand bosch 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 how am i clean there firstly first you can 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 shine a bright LED flashlight 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 we serve which case or less 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.930
 transparent battery we see inside 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 barely 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 can the light go out i believe here 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 peeking banks 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.590
 here look the battery cant 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.299
 see the liquid there is like this 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.619
 shine on all banks and see there 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:14.159
 not near electrolytes but we have a patient 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 a bank that's because we do not have anything either 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.860
 Fuck no, see 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 nothing happens the second way 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:34.229
 to understand if to go home is just 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 sound take individuals see here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 deaf 2g liquid I remembered osmosis 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 concerns a liter of it and deafly where emptiness 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530
 of how this visa 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.079
 like this you can still define it well 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 Of course with on it is more convenient if the body 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.020
 transparent here we have some fig 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.840
 no liquid black will do next 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.049
 many follow the battery cover but 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 Fu how nasty of course but here we have 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.759
 there is a special maze that is well 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.580
 shorter there are gases and neutralize the market 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.670
 somehow converted back to water 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.000
 ecosystem trees win win open same 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.470
 body can be here with the media flew in 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.209
 first again, we take the lantern and look 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.129
 you see we have emptiness here 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.609
 you can make a hole here 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:40.640
 this place here in the bank where we are 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.459
 you need to pour electrolyte or water there 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.310
 vodka don't even know that defect or 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.739
 evaporation at the cottage density check a 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.260
 then some 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.299
 in the way you can stick it 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 Just stick it on with glue, but I guess 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.340
 I'll just make the horse cut 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.620
 plastic of this size and here 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.290
 glue on top shorter even if he 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.989
 recover part just take a drill 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.400
 screwdriver and drill into the right us 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.400
 the place of response 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 all hole we have feathers you can 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.640
 zoom in and already look even inside 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.860
 Well, you have enough of such a hole 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.650
 density check here nothing more 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.440
 you can not do it because he will come here for 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.910
 the edge will touch this plastic one 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.250
 lids I looked king Kick did not know 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.660
 it seems to be a defect 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.750
 electrolyte plastinate plating itself 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.480
 top and then already immediately void sedov 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.680
 boiling there is not visible on the walls 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.280
 so here's the trouble well, then we take a syringe 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.549
 and add the desired level of electrolyte 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200
 lay exactly water and then shine 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.549
 which is already so we had all 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.090
 Banks equally well and glue here in 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.220
 In general, the whole essence of recovery 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.539
 if such a defect or some kind of fig 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.650
 in some banks happened 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:29.539
 evaporation like this 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.479
 bosch core and forgot to say something over 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.370
 sticking is best for us 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.200
 glue gun 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.070
 silicone glue well or you can 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.710
 use rubber buhnu glue he 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.630
 like not afraid of acid 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.660
 another tried nothing else 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.870
 I cannot recommend all these to everyone 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.870
 until
