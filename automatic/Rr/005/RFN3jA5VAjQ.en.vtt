there are there are quad lock units as

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.810 
there are there are quad lock units as
well<00:00:39.039> so<00:00:39.129> you<00:00:39.219> want<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.399> make<00:00:39.489> sure<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.699> get

well so you want to make sure you get
this<00:00:39.969> one<00:00:40.210> zero<00:00:40.810> zero<00:00:40.870> one<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.590> it's<00:00:42.070> at<00:00:42.250> i/o

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
this one zero zero one and it's at i/o

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.610 
this one zero zero one and it's at i/o
so<00:00:42.489> units<00:00:42.970> here<00:00:43.120> first<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.110> all<00:00:44.230> take<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.470> rage

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
so units here first of all take the rage

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.500 
so units here first of all take the rage
aware<00:00:44.950> then<00:00:45.489> we'll<00:00:45.610> go<00:00:45.700> from<00:00:45.790> there<00:00:45.880> so<00:00:46.030> oh<00:00:46.450> you

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.429 
and then start to unplug all of these
connectors<00:01:28.359> here<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:28.869> there's<00:01:29.139> usually<00:01:29.289> two

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
connectors here so there's usually two

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.340 
connectors here so there's usually two
tabs<00:01:29.859> on<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:29.979> edge<00:01:30.189> on<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.789> end<00:01:31.200> squeeze<00:01:32.200> them

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
tabs on the edge on the end squeeze them

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.230 
tabs on the edge on the end squeeze them
together<00:01:32.529> and<00:01:33.100> pull<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.459> out<00:01:33.520> then<00:01:34.029> you<00:01:34.119> left

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
together and pull it out then you left

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.029 
together and pull it out then you left
two<00:01:34.479> more<00:01:34.659> wires<00:01:34.810> which<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.229> one<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:35.859> one

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
two more wires which is one here one

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.440 
two more wires which is one here one
here<00:01:36.069> this<00:01:36.369> one<00:01:36.549> has<00:01:36.609> actually<00:01:36.729> got<00:01:37.029> a<00:01:37.060> clip<00:01:37.270> on

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
here this one has actually got a clip on

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
here this one has actually got a clip on
the<00:01:37.479> bottom<00:01:37.689> so<00:01:38.020> pull<00:01:38.529> the<00:01:38.649> little<00:01:38.859> clip<00:01:39.189> on

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the bottom so pull the little clip on

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.620 
the bottom so pull the little clip on
the<00:01:39.429> bottom<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.939> then<00:01:40.209> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.329> pull<00:01:40.599> that

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
the bottom and then you can pull that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.359 
the bottom and then you can pull that
out<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.079> this<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.409> aerial<00:01:41.770> exactly<00:01:42.130> pull

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
out and this is the aerial exactly pull

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.649 
out and this is the aerial exactly pull
straight<00:01:42.609> nuts<00:01:42.789> it's<00:01:42.999> all<00:01:43.240> done<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.630> should

with<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.620> wire<00:02:57.829> managed<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.610> connect<00:02:58.910> it

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
with that wire managed to connect it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.180 
with that wire managed to connect it
here<00:02:59.090> because<00:02:59.660> for<00:03:00.140> some<00:03:00.290> reason<00:03:00.319> there<00:03:00.980> are

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
here because for some reason there are

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.339 
here because for some reason there are
some<00:03:01.549> screws<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.629> too<00:03:02.810> small<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.290> is

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
some screws just too small this is

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.530 
some screws just too small this is
actually<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.769> t10<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> smallest<00:03:05.120> bit<00:03:05.420> of

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
actually a t10 this is a smallest bit of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.920 
actually a t10 this is a smallest bit of
love<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.349> actually<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:06.799> t10<00:03:07.629> just<00:03:08.629> get<00:03:08.780> that

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
love it's actually a t10 just get that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930 
love it's actually a t10 just get that
light<00:03:09.110> away<00:03:09.349> from<00:03:09.379> it<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.799> so<00:03:10.099> it's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.400> t10

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
light away from it here so it's a t10

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.360 
light away from it here so it's a t10
bit<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.200> bit<00:03:12.230> fit<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.129> I<00:03:13.160> just

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
bit and that bit fit in this so I just

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.780 
bit and that bit fit in this so I just
landed<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.349> then<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:16.250> connected<00:03:16.610> my
