00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
Bigfoot blind right there possible

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.120 
Bigfoot blind right there possible
suspect<00:04:00.650> something<00:04:01.650> built<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:04.130> we're

does see right here look and none of
these<00:04:58.400> have<00:04:58.640> any<00:04:59.090> branches<00:04:59.840> on<00:05:00.020> them<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.830> might

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
these have any branches on them it might

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.070 
these have any branches on them it might
I've<00:05:01.520> seen<00:05:01.790> nests<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:02.330> are<00:05:02.660> like<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:02.930> it

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
off the wet ground or they're staging

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.160 
off the wet ground or they're staging
them<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.340> build<00:05:07.550> something<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.720> know<00:05:08.840> what's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
them to build something you know what's

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.620 
them to build something you know what's
weird<00:05:09.380> is<00:05:09.680> uh<00:05:09.740> there<00:05:10.640> are<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.760> lot<00:05:10.940> like<00:05:11.150> people

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
weird is uh there are a lot like people

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.810 
weird is uh there are a lot like people
I<00:05:11.720> mean<00:05:11.900> what<00:05:12.110> other<00:05:12.140> animals<00:05:12.950> besides<00:05:13.190> birds

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
I mean what other animals besides birds

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.650 
I mean what other animals besides birds
build<00:05:14.240> nests<00:05:15.140> and<00:05:16.090> now<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.120> guess<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.420> lot<00:05:17.630> of

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
build nests and now I guess a lot of

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.920 
build nests and now I guess a lot of
creatures<00:05:18.080> build<00:05:18.820> dwellings<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.330> stuff<00:05:20.630> but

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
creatures build dwellings and stuff but

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.820 
creatures build dwellings and stuff but
look<00:05:21.830> I'm<00:05:22.190> pointing<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.210> blind<00:05:23.590> we<00:05:24.590> find

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
look I'm pointing it a blind we find

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.620 
look I'm pointing it a blind we find
territorial<00:05:25.370> structures<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:26.090> we're<00:05:26.270> finding

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
territorial structures and we're finding

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.710 
territorial structures and we're finding
where<00:05:26.810> logs<00:05:27.140> were<00:05:27.440> possibly<00:05:28.010> pulled<00:05:28.400> out<00:05:28.720> from

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
where logs were possibly pulled out from

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.660 
where logs were possibly pulled out from
up<00:05:29.930> here<00:05:30.260> that<00:05:31.100> we're<00:05:31.250> laying<00:05:31.400> here<00:05:31.610> and

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
up here that we're laying here and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:43.240 
up here that we're laying here and
drugged-out<00:05:41.140> actually<00:05:42.140> it's<00:05:42.290> not<00:05:42.710> Prince's

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
drugged-out actually it's not Prince's

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.890 
drugged-out actually it's not Prince's
it<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.610> drag<00:05:43.880> well<00:05:44.420> I<00:05:44.480> thought<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.750> was

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
it it's a drag well I thought it was

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.360 
it it's a drag well I thought it was
another<00:05:45.080> direction<00:05:45.440> you<00:05:45.740> know<00:05:45.860> what<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.220> think

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370
