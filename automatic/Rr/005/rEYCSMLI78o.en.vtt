00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.500
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.379
 small video and many have been 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 you guys my whole gaming setup now 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.900
 Let's see what I currently have and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.889
 yes, I will not show you the rest here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 everything is pretty much from the room 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 messy here then yes here again 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.430
 short just to show it here my 24th 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 inch samsung monitor full hd resolution 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.519
 is still lcd but is still in top shape 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 touch buttons down here yet 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.450
 background by skobbler is simply a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.670
 horny film yes then I have again 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.350
 a relatively jerky logitech 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 logitech wants to box I already have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 since I already believe more 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.140
 than two years 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 but they are still pretty good 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.149
 I do not really need that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.070
 often because I mostly stvg my 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 headset use that is now 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.160
 but not here but because 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.329
 we will continue the xbox one room then 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 I have the roccat kone here now 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.430
 + the rwi is still no concern 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 as well as to the svt at the moment i have 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 just little time because I have to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 work and I have to go to the weekend 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.689
 always somehow a day for victims so 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 So that has not me yet 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.210
 disappointed everything is great if lights 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.400
 now here in all possible colors 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.409
 from transitions from green to long 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.890
 slit completely green now from the green 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 us on 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 So it looks really cool and has on 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 every case so far no problems 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 made as keyboard I have something 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.420
 new something is new 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.590
 most of you know 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.450
 probably not experienced or yet 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
 panel foil over it so they do not like that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.540
 very dusty because somehow it is one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.659
 room always stops me even when i am 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.790
 just shortened so that's one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.420
 already so a few dishes so beginner 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 It's not like I do not care about violence like that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 that's the razer blackwidow ultimate 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 I hope you can see it now somehow 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.430
 so the camera does not do that now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.430
 sharp just because that apparently one 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.039
 little 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.010
 Anyway, it's funny 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.630
 razer has a genius keyboard 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.230
 logo can be quite good 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.140
 yes we are right we have it 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.190
 I really can write genius 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.610
 I have never written better 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.830
 can 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.780
 because I'm also tap ten fingers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.410
 and so came and in any case right 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 Great writing that belongs to one 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.060
 mechanical keyboard that means holding 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.070
 yes I'll tell her eternity she should 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 in any case backlit 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.230
 of course no question here I can too 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.020
 change that here now 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.430
 Dealers are even brighter 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.810
 but that's a bit too 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.630
 usually hinder the usual 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.470
 brightness levels and then nothing can 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.580
 Press again and then he will catch you 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.290
 to light up 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.450
 today on it and so on 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.940
 The briefing effect means that I have 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.970
 then completely out of that too and I have to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.459
 see on this stage so I 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.070
 is still relatively new in any case 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.930
 really awesome is expensive but me 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.920
 so far found that the price was worth it 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.870
 and yes then it goes on with my 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.470
 small gaming setup as well as for the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 bad in camera but no matter 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.920
 and then I have here now and in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.380
 my pc is a bit weird because 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.110
 I have to be behind it all the time 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.180
 connect headset 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.340
 yes still the same as before 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.340
 and 28 but I can tell you before 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.380
 it will be replaced soon when i return 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.290
 Money got obsidian by a corsair 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:52.690
 That's what I thought it was 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.640
 costs 150 euro, I believe is a lot of wood 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.230
 but I really want a corsa 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.019
 have housing because that should be easy 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.209
 just be the Bernese and that will be here 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.069
 I probably kind of like that 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.409
 Idea to use living room pc 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.480
 Well that was not but no idea 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.480
 I use it differently now 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.560
 some other pc look something 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.900
 I still do cheap tinkering together 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.410
 Samsung drive just to the cds 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.910
 read burn etc yes quite normally easy 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.169
 I do not need a blu-ray drive that 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.740
 I have I have a bottom 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.090
 Blu-ray player I have here is mine 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.979
 my logitech box is closed jan 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.370
 behind report has unfortunately broken 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.449
 and for whatever reason 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.770
 You can see the two of them up here 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.930
 sticker mark owen and howard on ebay 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.310
 We'll take a look at it now 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.150
 housing also if you are here now 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.759
 probably will see relatively little 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.080
 I do it just to talk to so 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.800
 At least a little look 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.210
 can reinwerfen 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.639
 it did not really work either 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.490
 a lot changed so it will be 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.990
 soon changed a lot as I said 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.110
 I will grow new mainboard 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.610
 new housing but everything at his time 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.599
 as a spouse I just became 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.479
 interrupted 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.490
 I have the update has now times 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.190
 packed away and then you see that here 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.009
 fabrics in general and I have here without 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.150
 fun before but not a month in there 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:22.150
 but what that rustles but that is here 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.830
 Dust pure dust than she is all in 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.520
 grunde I dust can show provides 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.710
 you do that here now 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.330
 it's dark, but we have to see it 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.039
 I will do it in these days but now 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.449
 make it a bit sour again, though 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:37.389
 do not have no hurry now 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:40.050
 so then i still have my relative 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:44.199
 I'll say bad or funny 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.539
 power supply beacon power l8 80plus bronze 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.030
 but I want either a gold 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.289
 and a platinum power supply also get from 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.539
 corsair probably but as I said 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.919
 all in good time 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.250
 the only thing I do not exchange 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:01.599
 or not 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.919
 the graphics card is this fat part 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.340
 It is probably the longest 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:09.850
 graphics card with the cooler 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:12.610
 there is a change that is the gtx 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.720
 570 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.900
 now I can not remember the name of the 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.790
 video what's your name now 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.510
 I forget it does not matter that gets up too 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.060
 a channel in the description here 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.770
 above, but the fan arctic cooling 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.440
 freezer 13 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.870
 he still delivers some work 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.060
 is cooled in a short time quite well off 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.930
 at i believe 4.2 against heart the whole 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.450
 time and by default so at 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.080
 high performance somehow at 60 degrees 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.740
 or something 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.700
 So that's definitely cool yes here 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.260
 is also a cool on the 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.370
 graphics card extreme +2 I have never 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.130
 better pictures seen 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:04.520
 we could say whatever you want 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:05.660
 is also running so ram is i could ram 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.490
 sometimes perhaps even replace 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.450
 but I do not really need that 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:15.860
 I have eight gb 2 x 4gb beets 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.970
 subject areas 1330 megahertz and that was 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.810
 it is also yes and then just another ice 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.800
 eat 2600k and basically that was it 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.300
 well it samsung ssd 128 here too 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.389
 gigabyte you might see here so 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.340
 a bit through the stop and just 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:33.340
 another 1 5 terabyte hard disk of 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 western digital can be or seagate 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.010
 I know it stands on a canal 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.030
 at least that was mine 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:50.240
 small setup their pc mouse keyboard 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.520
 still boxing and rushing 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.010
 may still be as 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.780
 relatively the same and you write the 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.970
 comments what you have for setups 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.349
 and then I would be happy about it 

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.349
 and we see the time again ciao
