00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649

 to promote a customer 's enchantment is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.880

 at the diet level is already in the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.810

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.070
 internship 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.740
 are little things that are great to 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.530
 level of patient care 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.290
 besides it is our Christianity we are 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.350
 responsible for drawing up the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.440
 guidelines for patients when they are 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.810
 the moment of your self is we realize 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.940
 also very specific guidelines 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.730
 for those pregnant women who are now 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 mothers and that we guide is the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.840
 correct food that she should make 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.120
 during the breastfeeding period 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.490
 another activity developed by the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.370
 nutrition sector is the participation of 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.510
 nutritionists in lectures focused on 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.790
 community 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.430
 It's like lectures to 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.250
 pregnant women to diabetic patients 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.140
 hypertensive patients also had a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.660
 head chef in this sector can 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.210
 look like a luxury but it certainly is one of the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.040
 evaluated by customers who 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.240
 have a large weight on the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.340
 institution 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.680
 the chef is able to perform 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.660
 a real twist on concepts 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.290
 existing information on feeding in a 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.650
 hospital 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.200
 the dishes even if they are intended for 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.870
 a diet of food restriction please 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.800
 many customers for the taste and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.780
 appearance 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.140
 good this work it comes from this 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.180
 between the hospital and the hotel is 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.820
 the chef's presence is extremely important. 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.340
 because it brings the complete 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.780
 patient satisfaction 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.419
 lately the components 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.060
 breaking down demystifying this idea of 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.850
 what hospital food is a bad thing 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.940
 The smell of the hospital is not 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.440
 bad has a strong smell 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:53.880
 people already arrive and I think it's terrible 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.229
 the environment itself then the boss it comes 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.460
 just for this 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:02.220
 it modifies this whole presentation puri 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.620
 in the area and together with 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.889
 nutritionists as they already make a 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.990
 differentiated work if they can 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.950
 be saying what they like and do not 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.270
 like 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.320
 on the basis of the information 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.500
 nutritionists come to me is to depend 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.590
 medical restriction within this 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.570
 patient is created new 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.880
 recipes is looking for what is 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.690
 give inside a hotel right 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.490
 who is the love that the hotel offers 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.830
 to your customer then what we try 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.960
 what do you try what the chef 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.800
 particularly tries to do within the 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.690
 hospital today is just that to enchant 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.820
 and please the customer as if they were 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.680
 a real role in creating methods 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.440
 cooking adding new ingredients 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.190
 respecting an original recipe that 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:07.430
 usually we serve in hotels, right? 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:11.820
 large scale but at the same time not 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.780
 there are no conflicts with the 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.599
 medical restriction that this patient has 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.650
 we also assist employees 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.530
 internal 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.919
 we also assist doctors in addition 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.030
 we also do events is like 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.430
 coffee break 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.020
 until dinner 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.180
 another particularity in the service of 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.849
 food is that meals are 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.700
 served in the apartment and stolen 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.490
 not by the nurses 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.620
 My name is Luis Sucupira. 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.620
 just bringing the patient's lunch
