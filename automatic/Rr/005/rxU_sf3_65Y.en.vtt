sells for this particular one is called

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:55.030 
sells for this particular one is called
WP<00:00:49.269> -<00:00:50.269> dc9<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:51.530> they<00:00:51.620> don't<00:00:51.800> make<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:53.629> SD<00:00:54.140> 800

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.189 
WP - dc9 but they don't make the SD 800
anymore<00:00:55.430> they<00:00:55.940> make<00:00:56.210> one<00:00:56.510> called

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
anymore they make one called

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.729 
anymore they make one called
SD<00:00:57.620> 870<00:00:58.629> now<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.719> reason<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.500> a

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
SD 870 now the reason that this is a

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.550 
SD 870 now the reason that this is a
particularly<00:01:01.399> good<00:01:01.640> one<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.210> because<00:01:03.250> it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
particularly good one is because it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.669 
particularly good one is because it
it's<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.710> wide-angle<00:01:07.009> camera<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.679> that's

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
it's a wide-angle camera and that's

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:10.960 
it's a wide-angle camera and that's
important<00:01:10.250> because<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.729> lot<00:01:10.940> of

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
important because I do a lot of

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.910 
important because I do a lot of
underwater<00:01:11.630> video<00:01:11.929> and<00:01:12.440> underwater

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
underwater video and underwater

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460 
underwater video and underwater
photography<00:01:13.640> with<00:01:13.789> this<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
photography with this but this is the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.020 
photography with this but this is the
case<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.710> allows<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.429> have<00:01:16.520> access<00:01:16.880> to

case that allows you to have access to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.700 
case that allows you to have access to
all<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.450> controls<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.170> camera<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:18.679> you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
all the controls on the camera so you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.520 
all the controls on the camera so you
can<00:01:18.800> change<00:01:19.190> anything<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.670> want<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:21.170> rated

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
can change anything you want it's rated

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.480 
can change anything you want it's rated
to<00:01:21.560> 130<00:01:22.250> feet<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:24.140> actually<00:01:24.619> was<00:01:25.130> blessed

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
to have the opportunity to go 130 feet

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.130 
to have the opportunity to go 130 feet
and<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.850> worked<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:29.179> like<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.599> said<00:01:29.840> no

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
and it worked just like it said no

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
diffuses it and the way that it opens is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.710 
diffuses it and the way that it opens is
pretty<00:01:40.099> simple<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:41.319> come<00:01:42.319> on<00:01:43.569> flip<00:01:44.569> this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
would recommend anybody get the Canon

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.200 
would recommend anybody get the Canon
870<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.860> whatever<00:02:30.860> waterproof<00:02:31.700> case<00:02:31.910> comes

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
870 and whatever waterproof case comes

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.770 
870 and whatever waterproof case comes

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
with it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.190 
with it
generally<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.640> cameras<00:02:34.640> cost<00:02:34.880> about<00:02:36.790> 300

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
generally the cameras cost about 300

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.350 
generally the cameras cost about 300
anywhere<00:02:39.200> from<00:02:39.350> 270<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.280> 300<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.150> case

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
anywhere from 270 to 300 and the case

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.310 
anywhere from 270 to 300 and the case

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
will cost anywhere from 170 to 200 so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.060 
will cost anywhere from 170 to 200 so
it's<00:02:45.709> about<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> $500<00:02:47.000> investment<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:50.600> me

it's about a $500 investment and for me

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.230 
it's about a $500 investment and for me
over<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.190> years<00:02:52.490> it's<00:02:52.670> proven<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:53.180> been

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
over the years it's proven to have been

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.980 
over the years it's proven to have been
worth<00:02:53.570> it

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
worth it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.900
