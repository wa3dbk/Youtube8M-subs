00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
there is absolutely no chance and I've

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500 
there is absolutely no chance and I've
felt<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.370> end<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.730> spectrum<00:02:20.880> before

I've<00:02:21.600> been<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.110> side<00:02:22.410> where<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:23.160> spawn<00:02:23.820> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I've been on that side where I spawn and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.730 
I've been on that side where I spawn and
just<00:02:24.180> die<00:02:24.330> instantaneously<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.650> I've

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.860 
I do think it sucks but you know it
forces<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.560> adjust<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.600> spawn

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
forces you to adjust that when you spawn

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870 
forces you to adjust that when you spawn
what<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.560> second<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.950> spawn<00:02:38.220> because

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
what to do the second you spawn because

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.340 
what to do the second you spawn because
there<00:02:39.030> are<00:02:39.120> times<00:02:39.300> where<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.990> play<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.290> the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
in so easily halo is just one of those

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.780 
in so easily halo is just one of those
type<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.560> games<00:05:25.830> where<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.310> learning<00:05:26.610> curve

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
type of games where the learning curve

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.150 
type of games where the learning curve
might<00:05:27.600> be<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> little<00:05:27.960> bit<00:05:28.110> larger<00:05:28.290> than<00:05:28.530> in

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
might be a little bit larger than in

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.980 
might be a little bit larger than in
something<00:05:29.669> like<00:05:29.760> call<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.030> duty<00:05:30.300> whereas

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
something like call of duty whereas

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.930 
something like call of duty whereas
anyone<00:05:31.500> can<00:05:31.740> pick<00:05:31.890> up<00:05:32.070> call<00:05:32.280> duty<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.730> even

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
anyone can pick up call duty and even

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.150 
anyone can pick up call duty and even
play<00:05:33.120> call<00:05:33.330> duty<00:05:33.510> recreationally<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.500> still

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
play call duty recreationally and still

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.890 
play call duty recreationally and still
be<00:05:35.340> really<00:05:35.669> good<00:05:35.820> at<00:05:35.970> it<00:05:36.120> whereas<00:05:36.419> inhale<00:05:36.690> it

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
be really good at it whereas inhale it

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.510 
be really good at it whereas inhale it
takes<00:05:37.080> time<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.740> get<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.040> certain<00:05:38.220> skill

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
takes time to get to a certain skill

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.120 
takes time to get to a certain skill
level<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.000> would<00:05:39.720> just<00:05:39.900> say<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:40.590> think<00:05:40.710> he'll<00:05:41.010> is

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
level I would just say I think he'll is

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.460 
level I would just say I think he'll is
really<00:05:41.400> worth<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.729> time<00:05:42.030> just<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.780> mean<00:05:43.169> if

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
really worth that time just I mean if

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.080 
really worth that time just I mean if
you<00:05:43.590> don't<00:05:43.740> enjoy<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:44.340> if<00:05:44.490> you<00:05:44.669> really<00:05:44.700> really

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
you don't enjoy it if you really really

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.940 
you don't enjoy it if you really really
hate<00:05:45.390> it<00:05:45.419> then<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.990> know<00:05:46.110> why<00:05:46.440> stick<00:05:46.740> with<00:05:46.919> it

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
hate it then you know why stick with it

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.640 
hate it then you know why stick with it
but<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.460> think<00:05:47.820> it's<00:05:48.120> fun<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.630> if<00:05:49.110> you<00:05:49.200> stick<00:05:49.440> to

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.390 
because I feel personally that the only
way<00:06:21.720> to<00:06:21.780> improve<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.470> by<00:06:22.620> going<00:06:22.830> against<00:06:23.250> one

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
way to improve is by going against one

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800 
way to improve is by going against one
of<00:06:23.430> those<00:06:23.550> kids<00:06:23.820> that's<00:06:24.060> untouchable<00:06:24.419> and

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
of those kids that's untouchable and

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.860 
of those kids that's untouchable and
that's<00:06:25.710> where<00:06:25.890> I<00:06:25.919> try<00:06:26.160> to<00:06:26.190> do<00:06:26.400> I<00:06:26.430> try<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.870> beat

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
that's where I try to do I try to beat

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.450 
that's where I try to do I try to beat
the<00:06:27.900> unbeatable<00:06:28.620> so<00:06:28.919> that<00:06:29.070> way<00:06:29.130> i<00:06:29.160> can<00:06:29.250> make

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
the unbeatable so that way i can make

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.060 
the unbeatable so that way i can make
myself<00:06:29.640> better<00:06:29.940> oh<00:06:30.260> that's<00:06:31.260> pretty<00:06:31.410> cool<00:06:31.530> yeah

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
myself better oh that's pretty cool yeah

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.370 
myself better oh that's pretty cool yeah
I<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.220> I<00:06:32.970> agree<00:06:33.510> to<00:06:33.570> certain<00:06:33.810> extent<00:06:34.200> but<00:06:34.260> I

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
I I I agree to certain extent but I

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.260 
I I I agree to certain extent but I
don't<00:06:34.740> believe<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:34.979> if<00:06:35.669> I<00:06:35.820> just<00:06:36.060> started

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
don't believe that if I just started

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.520 
don't believe that if I just started
playing<00:06:36.479> I<00:06:36.570> went<00:06:36.750> up<00:06:36.810> again<00:06:37.020> can't<00:06:37.229> against

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
playing I went up again can't against

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.570 
playing I went up again can't against
can't<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:37.830> odd<00:06:37.979> thing<00:06:38.099> that'd<00:06:38.280> be<00:06:38.370> good

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
can't be odd thing that'd be good

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.700 
can't be odd thing that'd be good
training<00:06:38.789> I<00:06:38.909> think<00:06:39.300> it<00:06:39.389> more<00:06:39.539> be<00:06:39.750> like<00:06:39.930> Falls

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.379 
training I think it more be like Falls
like<00:06:40.889> a<00:06:40.919> level<00:06:41.129> one<00:06:41.460> maybe<00:06:41.970> go<00:06:42.120> up<00:06:42.150> against

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
like a level one maybe go up against
