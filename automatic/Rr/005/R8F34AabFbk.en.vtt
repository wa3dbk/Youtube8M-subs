00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.550 
this is like a cultural not only
religious<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.690> cultural<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.440> social<00:02:40.790> event

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
religious but cultural and social event

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
religious but cultural and social event
and<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:45.060> think<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:47.640> raised<00:02:47.909> in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and I think that the the I was raised in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.770 
and I think that the the I was raised in
a<00:02:48.390> Catholic<00:02:48.799> family<00:02:49.799> very<00:02:50.760> conservative<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
a Catholic family very conservative and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.350 
a Catholic family very conservative and
we<00:02:52.230> still<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> accept

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
we still are but we also have to accept

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.880 
we still are but we also have to accept
that<00:02:57.599> maybe<00:02:58.549> Fatima<00:02:59.549> was<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.879> different<00:03:00.360> event

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.490 

this<00:03:03.460> doesn't<00:03:04.150> necessarily<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.960> collide

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
this doesn't necessarily have to collide

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.480 
this doesn't necessarily have to collide
with<00:03:05.800> religious<00:03:06.700> beliefs<00:03:08.490> something

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
with religious beliefs something

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.750 
with religious beliefs something
extraordinary<00:03:09.970> happened<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.980> maybe<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.580> was

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
extraordinary happened but maybe it was

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.280 
extraordinary happened but maybe it was
a<00:03:12.790> different<00:03:13.240> kind<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.630> contact

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
a different kind of contact

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.010

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
dried the the the land dried also but

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.029 
dried the the the land dried also but
they<00:05:02.110> also<00:05:02.259> heard<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.280> buzzing<00:05:03.550> noise<00:05:05.039> so

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.430 
they also heard the buzzing noise so
free<00:05:06.460> maybe<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:08.009> microwave<00:05:09.009> heat<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:11.020> also

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
free maybe a microwave heat that also

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.370 
free maybe a microwave heat that also
