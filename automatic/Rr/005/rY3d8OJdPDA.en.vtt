00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.110
 welcome everybody this is a lesson about hitting the left 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.800
 two hands mainly on the example of maria 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.570
 sharapova 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.369
 It is designed for those who have already passed 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.790
 first steps and saw our previous 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.640
 lessons such as a backhand with both hands 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.590
 for beginners tennis first steps as well 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 base trigger left two hands 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.790
 using the andre agassi kick scheme 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.190
 Maria Sharapova is a slightly different scheme 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.200
 training kick but also excellent 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.629
 option how to play left hand 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.250
 need an example of the best players yes and on 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.200
 option of female movement is small 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.500
 lessons for some reason all the patterns of movement 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000
 are created in the fight roaring I'm a supporter 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.250
 the idea that perhaps the female movement 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 different from masculine and it is intuitive 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.890
 and if this is not so then everything is much simpler 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.110
 so Maria is not just playing 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.360
 technically cool but nice to eat 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 some kind of aesthetics of car beats can 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.259
 be therefore thousands of girls started 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.880
 playing tennis trying to imitate and 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.310
 create over a long 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 time around a construct around 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.509
 which form such qualities as 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.609
 love for training and most importantly skill 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.280
 Winning tournaments is much harder in 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.009
 This design also includes technical 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.139
 preparation backhand I divide by 9 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 main parts where each part has 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:30.299
 its technical time components 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 the technical component is the mechanics 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.430
 the body this corners all became position by 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 relation to the sword 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.640
 muscle work temporary how much time 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 takes one movement or another in which 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.869
 a point at this moment on the street why are we 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.000
 see in what moments are taken 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.890
 decisions and how much time remains on their 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.140
 implementation for whom this series 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 There are few video players 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.610
 reflect on the process but at the same time 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.399
 achieve results there are those who are looking for 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.560
 and also achieve results this series 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.149
 for those who want to figure out at 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.780
 to the extent of an intellectual shock 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.910
 for no one and these lessons lead in 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.800
 training belongs to the exercise but their 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.080
 it is necessary to select taking into account those subtleties 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.630
 the movement that will be shown in these 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640
 series so start at each point of flight 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.890
 ball you need to do something or 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.560
 other movement and accordingly include 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.489
 certain muscle groups and if for example 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.410
 ball over the net 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.450
 then it's half a second after hitting an opponent 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.250
 then at this moment there is a launch 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.530
 movement oriented approach to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 blows all our movements must be 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.239
 tied to the sword and so the main parts 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.540
 hitting it is a race 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.760
 turn approach step on the ball lowering 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.220
 paradise cell supination cells or better lead 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.569
 left hand brush ejection phase along with 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.879
 ending starting position 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.129
 this division by 9 for many is subjective 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.109
 thing can divide it by 3 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.510
 it is possible to not divide by 100 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.639
 just in my work often have 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.639
 analyze the equipment on video 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.959
 and to make this process the most 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.879
 technological in the search for errors 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.590
 tennis player or vice versa understand by 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.260
 why does he play so cool 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.180
 do the following i throw my 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.680
 kind of coordinate grid which allows 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.049
 segmented movements 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.799
 find out where the error begins well 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.169
 real example 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.230
 a man cannot invest in his pitch 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.359
 leads away from the point of impact you break into 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.680
 parts of the feed you see a mistake in the technique 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.379
 right leg attachments 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.180
 further seen on the example of those who have this 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.549
 errors no movement development occurs 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.889
 right so here we look further 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.870
 all nine left hitting elements 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.449
 hands on the example of Mary Sharapova 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.930
 and today everything was with you Sergey 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.930
