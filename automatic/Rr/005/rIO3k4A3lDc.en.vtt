00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bit more powerful briefly and there's a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
bit more powerful briefly and there's a
few<00:01:57.720> others<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.049> I'll<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.860> later<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.520> in

that will cause an enemy to commit
suicide<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.580> there's<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.269> that<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.979> cause

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
suicide and there's one that will cause

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860
