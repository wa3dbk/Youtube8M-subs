00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
well as we wanted it to on the live game
so<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> expansion<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.559> making<00:00:37.829> changes

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so in the expansion we're making changes

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
so in the expansion we're making changes
the<00:00:38.670> skills<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.329> fist<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> thunder<00:00:40.500> thunder

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
clap is the most popular rune on live
and<00:00:43.219> one<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> reasons<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and one of the reasons is because it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.319 
and one of the reasons is because it
incorporates<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.750> teleport<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.500> its<00:00:46.800> ability
