I just drew on with a bronze and then I
drew<00:02:17.460> in<00:02:17.580> my<00:02:17.730> contour<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> grey<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.520> on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
drew in my contour with a grey and on

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000 
drew in my contour with a grey and on
top<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.420> patted<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.170> some<00:02:22.620> gold

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
top of that I patted on some gold

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.270 
top of that I patted on some gold
glitter<00:02:23.490> these<00:02:24.000> make<00:02:24.330> excellent<00:02:24.810> basis<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
glitter these make excellent basis but

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910 
glitter these make excellent basis but
they're<00:02:26.460> also<00:02:26.670> really<00:02:27.120> good<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.810> eyeshadow<00:02:28.290> in

they're also really good as eyeshadow in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.699 
they're also really good as eyeshadow in
themselves<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.840> use<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> good<00:02:31.260> base

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
themselves so if you use a good base

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.190 
themselves so if you use a good base
these<00:02:32.190> actually<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:32.940> crease<00:02:33.390> oh<00:02:33.630> I'm<00:02:33.959> just
