00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello I'm Juan in a new edition of the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.540
 project city and good today I bring you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.320
 the first building arrives 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.660
 has proposed one of our 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.200
 followers and good has proposed me a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.200
 fitness center 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:29.840
 so 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.840
 trying to dawn and on the other hand what 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.539
 with this 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.230
 Finally 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.340
 good 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.420
 what have I done although it may not seem 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.530
 the red the blue are boxing gloves 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.829
 and good 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 this is a building 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.970
 tiny one is worth 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.590
 but it's a pass 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.330
 of the hospital is inside the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 machines but I think it's pretty 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 lined and as always live has 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.930
 your comments about it that you do not 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.930
 you leave but well I try 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.000
 well let's go there 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 the pizjuÃ¡n evasion 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 In my opinion, it is the best 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 the first floor for sale 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.429
 at the entrance and here 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.230
 cut larger 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.860
 view can not be put to anything good 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.940
 we leave it and if that already modified 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 and good 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.370
 we have up to here already it is worth 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.780
 I would come 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.320
 oh shit it's true that it has to be 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 A) Yes 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.610
 with this in the series with paulo de kraft 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.890
 herpes 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.580
 you can also follow it also says what 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.450
 same so it's good 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 a garment 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.530
 with this floor are the lockers and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.069
 the changing rooms 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.069
 Y 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.100
 it does not have much 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.100
 the young woman of cajeme equal but 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.170
 i 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:57.670
 just roof with a perspective that is 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 prompting and it 's for the floor below to 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.490
 the machines 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.920
 to run 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.660
 means that through it was like it is 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.310
 my field 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.310
 this would be an exercise bicycle 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.990
 these are devices this hooks you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.990
 if you go down 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.209
 what 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.030
 logically I could not make the prey 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.180
 why 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.220
 it's not quite complex it would be the typical 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.170
 mind that there are some exhibitor images 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.980
 They placed the smaller dumbbells 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 stress in tasks 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.300
 it is a device that are the pones genes 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.300
 here and with the hands then I would join them 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.090
 halfheartedly as gymnastics so 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.349
 well with what little I've seen 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.360
 and in the part now we have 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.360
 approximately all this advance 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.990
 Let's come 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.140
 a gadget of this created and about 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.140
 up there 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.470
 The bag 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.060
 and those that the apparatus exists on the ground 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.230
 I hit him 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.230
 and we have the king 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.750
 Y 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.750
 teams since they could do battle 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.570
 also for people who have not seen that 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.640
 is the third video and that this is not a 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.900
 server this is something that is if not me 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.900
 why not 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.450
 maybe later there will be a being 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.450
 but at the moment there is not much expectation 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.940
 and go here for Vejer 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.330
 the agenda 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.870
 ah 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.870
 ah 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.770
 the truth is that the system goes for 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.240
 make a server with two friends would be 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.599
 pretty cool 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.599
 because we will do 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.599
 gymnastics 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.449
 and also that not because yes 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:48.939
 we would stay every day 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.939
 I also have another good thing the showers 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.960
 that is, I already have the mode installed 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.080
 train 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.479
 and the next video I'm going to show the 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.800
 central station is going to be demonstrate and 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:08.490
 explain the trains mode because I do not 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.220
 I speak crafter 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.720
 and the truth is that it is quite complex 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.390
 tell 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.850
 if you do like me you can not find 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:24.160
 information and nothing until you ask for the 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.380
 trick you can die is not like a 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.030
 first version of the tunnel boring machine say 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.030
 now no longer deserves much worth 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:40.200
 so with this with this view 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.200
 See you in the next video
