00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.999 

really<00:01:26.009> fast<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.729> next<00:01:27.000> section<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.009> you're

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
really fast the next section and you're

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
really fast the next section and you're
basically<00:01:29.429> in<00:01:29.520> Rock<00:01:29.910> mushroom<00:01:30.390> form<00:01:30.660> non-stop

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
basically in Rock mushroom form non-stop

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.839 
basically in Rock mushroom form non-stop
throughout<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> rest<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.429> level<00:01:32.700> like

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
throughout the rest of the level like

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:38.560 
throughout the rest of the level like
starting<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:35.209> what<00:01:36.209> you<00:01:36.330> want<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
starting here and what you want to do is

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.780 
starting here and what you want to do is
first<00:01:39.260> you<00:01:39.470> want<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.710> just<00:01:39.770> hit<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.130> bridge<00:01:40.580> I

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
first you want to just hit that bridge I

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.850 
first you want to just hit that bridge I
thought<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:41.450> some<00:01:41.570> reason<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.530> had<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
thought for some reason that you had to

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.770 
thought for some reason that you had to
like<00:01:46.930> all<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.080> have<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.320> do<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.820> just<00:01:49.820> going<00:01:50.479> in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
like all you have to do is just going in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.330 
like all you have to do is just going in
the<00:01:50.869> bridge<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:51.860> once<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.159> do<00:01:52.310> that

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the bridge and then once you do that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.370 
the bridge and then once you do that
you're<00:01:52.700> basically<00:01:53.030> rolling<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:53.720> non-stop

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
you're basically rolling like non-stop

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.430 
you're basically rolling like non-stop
for<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.710> rest<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.040> level<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:57.290> have

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
for the rest of the level and you have

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.180 
for the rest of the level and you have
to<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.710> very<00:01:57.860> careful<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> controls

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
to be very careful with the controls

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.130 
to be very careful with the controls
because<00:02:01.190> I'm<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:01.610> joined<00:02:01.940> too<00:02:02.119> bad<00:02:02.330> like<00:02:02.810> this

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
because I'm not joined too bad like this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.639 
because I'm not joined too bad like this
run<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.040> was<00:02:04.780> hanging<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:06.020> there<00:02:06.229> but<00:02:06.850> yeah

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
run and I was hanging in there but yeah

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.410 
run and I was hanging in there but yeah
jumped<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.920> too<00:02:10.130> soon<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.180> be<00:02:11.239> very

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
jumped a little too soon it to be very

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.440 
jumped a little too soon it to be very
careful<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.050> timing<00:02:12.530> on<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:14.239> level

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
careful with the timing on this level

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.550 
careful with the timing on this level
when<00:02:14.660> you're<00:02:14.780> jumping<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.380> when<00:02:15.470> you're

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
when you're jumping and when you're

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.900 
when you're jumping and when you're
moving<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.220> very<00:02:16.340> delicate<00:02:16.640> with

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
moving you have to be very delicate with

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.280 
moving you have to be very delicate with
the<00:02:17.060> controls<00:02:17.450> I've<00:02:17.690> talked<00:02:17.900> about<00:02:18.050> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the controls I've talked about that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.790 
the controls I've talked about that
before<00:02:18.470> where<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:20.410> guys<00:02:21.410> sort<00:02:21.709> of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.190 

oversteering<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.120> guess<00:02:26.360> overcorrecting<00:02:27.080> or

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
oversteering I guess overcorrecting or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.860 
oversteering I guess overcorrecting or

part<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.350> am<00:04:12.030> yeah<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.930> was<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.410> first<00:04:14.590> time<00:04:14.680> I'd

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
part I am yeah it was the first time I'd

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
not expecting that so you you have like

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.490

one of those little barriers blocking
off<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.710> where<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.949> star<00:05:10.250> is

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
think I would get all the way to the end

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.900 
think I would get all the way to the end
I<00:05:17.930> got<00:05:18.110> really<00:05:18.320> good<00:05:18.410> at<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:19.729> whole

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
and I would get to the end and I kept

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.670 
and I would get to the end and I kept
running<00:05:26.000> into<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.449> damn<00:05:26.750> barrier<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.470> was

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
running into that damn barrier I was

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.930 
running into that damn barrier I was
like<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.099> mad<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.349> have<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.770> tie<00:05:31.370> this<00:05:31.610> very

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
like so mad so you have to tie this very

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.649 
like so mad so you have to tie this very
carefully<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:37.340> was<00:05:37.520> just<00:05:37.729> very<00:05:37.940> strange

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
carefully it was just very strange

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.189 
carefully it was just very strange
it<00:05:39.650> just<00:05:39.860> kept<00:05:40.300> they<00:05:41.300> just<00:05:41.569> wouldn't<00:05:41.900> jump

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
it just kept they just wouldn't jump

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.170 
it just kept they just wouldn't jump
over<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:42.590> was<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.919> weirdest<00:05:43.310> thing<00:05:43.400> so<00:05:44.120> you

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
over it was the weirdest thing so you

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.270 
over it was the weirdest thing so you
kind<00:05:44.449> of<00:05:44.509> have<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.720> wait<00:05:45.080> like<00:05:45.349> an<00:05:45.500> extra<00:05:46.009> like

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
kind of have to wait like an extra like

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.089 
kind of have to wait like an extra like
half<00:05:47.090> a<00:05:47.240> second<00:05:47.659> longer<00:05:48.080> than<00:05:48.349> you<00:05:48.680> think<00:05:48.889> you

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
half a second longer than you think you

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.730 
half a second longer than you think you
should<00:05:49.130> cuz<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:50.330> know<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.479> think<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.990> reflex

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
should cuz you know I think the reflex

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.439 
should cuz you know I think the reflex
is<00:05:51.889> to<00:05:52.039> jump<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.370> little<00:05:52.490> bit<00:05:52.759> early<00:05:53.090> just<00:05:53.330> to

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
is to jump a little bit early just to

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.209 
is to jump a little bit early just to
make<00:05:53.599> sure<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:54.080> you<00:05:54.590> don't<00:05:54.770> fall<00:05:55.009> off

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
make sure that you you don't fall off

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.760 
make sure that you you don't fall off
but<00:05:55.699> I<00:05:55.969> kind<00:05:56.570> of<00:05:56.630> had<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.810> let<00:05:57.020> him<00:05:57.080> go<00:05:57.139> you<00:05:57.620> know

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
but I kind of had to let him go you know

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.670 
but I kind of had to let him go you know
an<00:05:57.860> extra<00:05:58.310> you<00:05:59.120> know<00:05:59.270> Lillis<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.780> get<00:05:59.930> longer<00:06:00.229> so

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
he's right on the edge before you jump

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.899 
he's right on the edge before you jump
so<00:06:02.659> you<00:06:02.690> can<00:06:02.870> make<00:06:02.990> that<00:06:03.639> but<00:06:04.639> yeah<00:06:04.729> so<00:06:04.849> that's

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.999 
so you can make that but yeah so that's
85<00:06:05.389> stars<00:06:05.780> now<00:06:06.020> and<00:06:06.349> then<00:06:06.469> I'll<00:06:06.560> be<00:06:06.680> good<00:06:06.830> for

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
85 stars now and then I'll be good for

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.630 
85 stars now and then I'll be good for
this<00:06:07.130> video<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.699> think<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.449> guys
