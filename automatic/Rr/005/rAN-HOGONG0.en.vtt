 working for this great challenge that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.740
 was to value the system 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.970
 Argentine railroad so that people 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.240

 totally the renovation of the railway 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.810
 miter as we did with the san 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.110
 Martin as we did with the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:39.560
 Sarmiento is simply saying that 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.160
 surely this is not going to be tomorrow 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 the cover of the diaries of the monopolies 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.420
 media or surely in any of 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.240
 the web pages but you told me 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.080
 a long time ago at a time also 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.680
 difficult skinny no matter what they say 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.989
 the newspapers the next day if not what 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.660
 important is how you do not remember the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 History and history will remind us 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.610
 especially you as a president who 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.480
 has carried out a process of 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.390
 public transformation in Argentina 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.200
 those who believe in independence 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 of the policy 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.920
 that we believe in the autonomy of 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.240
 policy over any interest 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.100
 sectorial 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.870
 media and businessman 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.400
 no matter how important it is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.640
 of these sectors that have governed 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.569
 for many years 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.060
 without vote and without face conditioning not to 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.910
 governments but to the whole of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.960
 Argentine people 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.580
 we believe 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.460
 firmly that there is no attack by 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.220
 more important that it be for simpler 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.340
 added that it can stop this 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.450
 transformation process that header 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.290
 cristina and finally 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.959
 and finally tell you that we are millions 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 the Argentines that we have the 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:22.230
 tranquility that we have the tranquility 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.300
 to know we have a president 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.250
 willing to never give up what 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.120
 only one leader should not resign 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.840
 political that is the defense of interest 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.590
 Overall regardless whatever 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.700
 that cost this is the second branch of the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.940
 Miter railroad that we are putting to 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.120
 new with 0km trains increasing the 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.120
 transport capacity by 40 per 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 cent is the second branch because the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.160
 first was the tiger removal 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.250
 we are doing the josé león suárez 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:06.060
 retirement and next February 9 my 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.070
 three withdrawals this includes of course 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.800
 comprehensive system renewal plan 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.990
 railway that we have been carrying 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.780
 the last two years by decision of the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.520
 president of the republic and good as 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.729
 you can see his 3d in last 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.620
 generation 0km 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.169
 over 50 years ago they did not enter 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.210
 0km and good trains we are fulfilling 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.639
 with this debt that we had from the 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.810
 national government that put in value 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.810
 the entire Argentine railway system
