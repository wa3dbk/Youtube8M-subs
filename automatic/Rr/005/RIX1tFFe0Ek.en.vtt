00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.569
 on 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.169
 the experts are helpful to us at this stage 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.099
 Percent that 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 Percent says 30 the most important thing is that it is about 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.269
 Bundesliga points 60 episodes 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.579
 needs these points non-voters for the FC Schalke 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.560
 The Bundesliga eventually stood out they can now count on the 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.960
 The Champions League and the percent bought dropped the cup final of course 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.559
 concentrate while we desperately need points in the relegation battle and there 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:40.500
 would 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.330
 despite having no more play in the summer 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.090
 However, the last two games only want to score two points 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250
 we've gotten a bit angry, but not really 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 the place has come Opel is the most important for us the Pils on Schalke 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.750
 Point 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.519
 the head coach percent of course is the one she plays 1 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.980
 So so 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.040
 like other games against former teams took 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.300
 these play 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.920
 inhabited this year 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 to play against enemies who feel 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.090
 have trained 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910
 but through her life the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.620
 Short-term nature of events 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
 Of course you are still one percent 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 a bit too close to that 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.180
 easy to dismiss 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.290
 conceivable that i have laid many different bases the fire mine 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 task 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.330
 like that was a big change in the summer in this activity 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.010
 has been by some 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.830
 and that shows now that this change was correct that this change 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.660
 the very word of which no longer spoke has thereby laid the foundation for 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.600
 Schalke in the next few years to be able to celebrate the championship and me 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.630
 would like to 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.799
 To fulfill my work as well that was my goal 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.830
 I do not have to incriminate myself anymore so far where now 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.120
 what to do with the present time can cancel with the task and Ralf Rangnick 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.179
 hands over an account of things 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.449
 has the task to take over all of this we will all be in 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.269
 to be smarter one two three years 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.340
 how it went I can not even lead to the future and he wrote 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.360
 Zeng current president to pick lid especially in that one 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.499
 team 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.639
 percent was successful 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 Percent in addition to long unsuccessful last not so successful were rarely seen 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.510
 if just the additional burden in the Champions League for FC Schalke 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.659
 then Andy Kapp shows again 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.029
 Holger Rohde 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.769
 Horb us 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.999
 by virtue of 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 the hands do not succeed too much Prague 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.329
 lying Nicholson little animals not at the top 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.559
 Kohlers buys himself here and there talking about how we could actually get the vw-bus 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:03.769
 Backbone he has actually looked good on in the past 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:04.150
 Schalke
