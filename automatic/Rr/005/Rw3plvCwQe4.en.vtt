00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
beneficial for me and the end I think

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.720 
beneficial for me and the end I think
actually<00:00:15.770> being<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.890> bit<00:00:17.100> quick<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.670> know

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
actually being a bit quick you know

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.779 
actually being a bit quick you know
across<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> ground<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.400> was<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> bit

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
across the ground it was it was a bit

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.910 
across the ground it was it was a bit
easier<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.359> think<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.779> ride<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.320> general<00:00:22.740> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
easier I think to ride in general you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
easier I think to ride in general you
know<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> forward-thinking<00:00:23.760> course<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
know is a forward-thinking course and I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
at the at the mount it was maybe a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
at the at the mount it was maybe a
little<00:01:40.799> bit<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> second<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.720> he

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
little bit off of the second one but he

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
little bit off of the second one but he
he<00:01:43.290> left<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> ground<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.130> great<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
he left the ground and was great in this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.399 
he left the ground and was great in this
up<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.240> minutes<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.810> top<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> hill

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
up on my minutes on top of the hill

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
up on my minutes on top of the hill
really<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.640> happy<00:01:47.880> with

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
really well I was really happy with

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
really well I was really happy with
where<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.299> was<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
where I was there and then all of a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.929 
where I was there and then all of a
sudden<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.130> came<00:01:50.340> back<00:01:50.369> down<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> hill

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
sudden when you came back down the hill

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
sudden when you came back down the hill
I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.420> second<00:01:51.780> water<00:01:51.930> crossing<00:01:52.409> takes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I think that second water crossing takes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
I think that second water crossing takes
a<00:01:52.920> long<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> minute<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
a long time and we have a minute at the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
a long time and we have a minute at the
bank<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.700> down<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bank and I was down but I you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
bank and I was down but I you
you<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> climb<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> big<00:01:59.369> hill<00:01:59.579> again<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you have to climb the big hill again so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
you have to climb the big hill again so
I<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> let<00:02:01.229> him<00:02:01.320> cruise<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.740> there

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
I just kind of let him cruise up there

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.649 
I just kind of let him cruise up there
and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.100> tried<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.640> time<00:02:02.939> around

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and then tried to make up time around
