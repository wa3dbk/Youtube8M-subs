here the next box we haven't started the
harvest<00:01:14.630> too<00:01:14.780> much<00:01:14.960> we'll<00:01:15.170> start<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:15.680> one

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
replant that one with some seedlings we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.440 
replant that one with some seedlings we
got<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.880> somewhere<00:01:23.300> else<00:01:24.850> these<00:01:25.850> are<00:01:26.210> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
will cover this trellis area probably in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.140 
will cover this trellis area probably in
the<00:02:38.780> next<00:02:38.959> two<00:02:39.290> weeks<00:02:41.349> pretty<00:02:42.349> well<00:02:43.150> lots

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the next two weeks pretty well lots

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.780 
the next two weeks pretty well lots
flowers<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.519> lots<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.730> small<00:02:47.920> cucumbers

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.830 

maybe<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.120> see<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.810> or<00:02:53.959> two<00:02:54.170> back<00:02:54.530> there

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.140 

maybe<00:03:00.379> not<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.590> bugs<00:03:03.800> start<00:03:04.129> getting<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
maybe not the bugs start getting it and

look at the one underneath it starting
to<00:05:54.690> clear<00:05:54.930> up<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.230> maybe<00:05:55.440> that'll<00:05:55.590> take<00:05:55.860> care

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
to clear up so maybe that'll take care

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.400 
to clear up so maybe that'll take care
of<00:05:56.130> itself<00:05:56.310> without<00:05:57.080> researching<00:05:58.080> and

spraying the heck out of it with

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.200 
spraying the heck out of it with
chemicals<00:06:02.510> those<00:06:03.510> will<00:06:03.900> probably<00:06:04.200> buy<00:06:05.210> next

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
chemicals those will probably buy next

time we take the video in a week or two

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.820 
time we take the video in a week or two
they'll<00:06:08.310> start<00:06:08.700> to<00:06:08.880> grow<00:06:09.260> over<00:06:10.260> the<00:06:10.410> trellis

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830

bought from a smaller stock of plant so

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.430 
bought from a smaller stock of plant so
we're<00:07:17.990> thinking<00:07:18.020> that<00:07:18.410> these<00:07:18.710> will<00:07:18.980> get<00:07:19.220> right

we're thinking that these will get right
little<00:07:21.440> later<00:07:21.620> than<00:07:21.770> the<00:07:21.890> other<00:07:22.010> ones<00:07:22.360> and

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
little later than the other ones and

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.410 
little later than the other ones and
we'll<00:07:24.200> have<00:07:24.350> them<00:07:24.410> for<00:07:24.740> a<00:07:24.820> longer<00:07:25.820> period<00:07:26.210> of

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
we'll have them for a longer period of

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.390 
we'll have them for a longer period of
time<00:07:26.480> even<00:07:27.080> though<00:07:27.380> there<00:07:27.530> is<00:07:27.650> fruit<00:07:27.920> on<00:07:28.130> the

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
time even though there is fruit on the

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.880 
time even though there is fruit on the
plants<00:07:28.790> not<00:07:28.970> quite<00:07:29.870> as<00:07:30.020> tall<00:07:30.290> as<00:07:30.590> the<00:07:30.740> other
