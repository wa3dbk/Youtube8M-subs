00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:12.660
 Now we are making a transition or varnish coming 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 do two different ways this will be like 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 now you can srazy 134 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:31.550
 Now we are working with up to 34 patent spout 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 a thin layer of 1 or 2 people 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 girls salon level every time you 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.630
 should get settled 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.080
 Well, view oregano average price 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.820
 politics here is a reinforcement going on above you 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.540
 bread is just like we did in the first 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:55.560
 option she goes 250 300 hryvnia if you 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 doing build up 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.100
 add a little one 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.640
 46 here look, we made the second layer 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:14.759
 at 100,000 thursday 4 colors are available now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.890
 take 46 gel Polish 46 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.580
 he is so red no pink 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.860
 call gel polish to the maiden we take the usual 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 needle 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 who what is there at hand is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 clamp need to calmly principle tweezers 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.700
 who what is but for starters if you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.929
 want to smoothly make the transition we can 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.830
 134 that we had a basis 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:59.220
 stir 46 you make it lighter 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 so that a bright color does not immediately do 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.830
 I ’m breaking the transition 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:16.930
 here and so just sponge blot 3 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.930
 feather yourself you see on the screen 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.170
 here are just a lot of shaded big 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 the amount of gel polish on the sponge is not 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.940
 recruit because first will 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 bubble which she won't smooth 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.300
 transition 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.290
 look it almost at the camera not 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.760
 see more poured gel polish recruit 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.710
 but it will not bubble 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.050
 but there will be no major 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.000
 need to do it in several stages 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.520
 one time and one time 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.010
 drying you just extinguish 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.170
 in one place put the lamp crush 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:08.380
 this and that it is necessary to do not seem to me 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:11.040
 for any more than 5 for a little bit straight 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 on a sticky layer 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.600
 even 30 seconds is enough just him 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 will fix to further the second color 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.120
 mixed the same thing we blot 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.420
 sponge again did not even give me 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.130
 it seems more depending what 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.720
 contrast 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.600
 do you want to get color every time u 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.090
 We all have a mother, I feel again 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.090
 after 30 enclaves drier 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.890
 the main thing on the sponge is a lot of gel polish not 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.080
 type right here he just right then 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.599
 I type here see bubbles here 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.540
 such become a little him 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.239
 type here it will be on the nails so it 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.750
 ugly already design you fail 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.180
 he doesn’t equal him 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.250
 tower wait a dried it already 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.090
 no way to express if the bubbles are 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.010
 get a place from the bubbles 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:26.130
 engines a little lower 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:30.130
 raise so high go live more 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:34.930
 heavy blackout 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.930
 here put the lamp on 30 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 slightly take 46 in the same system 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:55.060
 dipping sponge already darker turns 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.430
 i just mixed 140 134 was 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.610
 lighter feelings between them make color 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.610
 and what if the 46th is so bright enough 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.460
 but no longer 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.460
 the middle is closer 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:17.580
 dropped below 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.440
 dims already into this already depending on 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.300
 nail lengths yes that is if we have 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.300
 the tip is short 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.270
 principle this could be the second 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:40.200
 if you want to make 3 colors 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:43.380
 calm so you can not interfere with bubbles. 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.060
 just shade remove big 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.920
 the amount of gel polish buying is just 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.110
 shade or just take a new one 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.600
 and just remove the sponge and choose 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.670
 shade bubbles 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.760
 make it not necessary to dry it 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:02.780
 gel lacquer transition you won't get better 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.780
 several times like this 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:16.080
 Klymenko 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.710
 leave inherent same way you can 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.750
 know what 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.040
 for powder, that's what's for the tone 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.630
 cream homeless they are very soft and kamaly 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.500
 choose it very much 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:33.670
 absorbs the movie she is very absorbed not 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.600
 need to be careful the edge of the nail again 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.600
 still dim 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.790
 in principle, if you want to make a tip 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:49.270
 darker you can this 46 slightly black 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.860
 add a little drop 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.860
 black out can be done crocs 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.650
 nastusha 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.070
 in the lamp for 3 minutes overlap 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:19.570
 In principle, he seems to be a little bit 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.570
 smooths our transition to me completely
