this number 16 gig stick this one is
obviously<00:00:22.680> some<00:00:23.310> sort<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> metal

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
obviously some sort of metal

construction<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.130> small<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.760> it's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
construction very very small so it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.720 
construction very very small so it's
just<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.330> comparison<00:00:27.630> sake<00:00:28.730> for

is<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.770> sort<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> sturdy<00:00:50.960> rigid<00:00:52.340> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
is a more sort of sturdy rigid one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a more sort of sturdy rigid one
rather<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.300> having<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> aesthetics<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> the

bit of documentation on the inside as
usual<00:01:25.430> unless<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> actual<00:01:26.880> thing<00:01:27.030> itself<00:01:28.850> so

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
usual unless the actual thing itself so

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.020

it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> plastic<00:01:32.250> construction<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it's a plastic construction it's not

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.100 
it's a plastic construction it's not
metal<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> looks<00:01:37.430> fingerprints<00:01:39.110> are

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
metal like it looks fingerprints are

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
metal like it looks fingerprints are
definitely<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> problem<00:01:43.880> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
definitely going to be a problem but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
definitely going to be a problem but
you've<00:01:45.030> got<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> cover<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> USB<00:01:46.170> itself

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you've got the cover for the USB itself

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.929 
you've got the cover for the USB itself
which<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> always<00:01:47.310> good<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.820> you're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
which is always good when you're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.429 
which is always good when you're
traveling<00:01:49.280> over<00:01:50.280> although<00:01:50.990> bit<00:01:51.990> flimsy

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
traveling over although bit flimsy

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
traveling over although bit flimsy
plastic<00:01:52.560> construction<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.490> idea<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
plastic construction but the idea of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.999 
plastic construction but the idea of
this<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.840> much<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.229> durable<00:01:55.649> than

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this is that it's much more durable than

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.719 
this is that it's much more durable than
