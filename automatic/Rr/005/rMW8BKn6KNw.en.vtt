the trials have gone on through the
morning<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.429> third<00:00:29.580> times<00:00:29.880> probably<00:00:30.240> in

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

morning I think third times probably in
a<00:00:30.420> couple<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.750> seconds<00:00:31.250> superior<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> most

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
a couple of seconds superior to most

a couple of seconds superior to most
other<00:00:32.700> jump<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.719> surprising

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
other jump out so that's not surprising

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.950 
other jump out so that's not surprising
looks<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.800> her<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.570> more<00:00:36.570> importantly

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
looks like her but more importantly

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.150 
looks like her but more importantly
we're<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.290> pleased<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> condition

quick<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.940> everyone<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.059> happy<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
quick and everyone was happy it's a I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
quick and everyone was happy it's a I
think<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> first<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:43.440> Luke's<00:00:43.680> been<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.980> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
think the first time Luke's been on this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
think the first time Luke's been on this
preparation<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.500> thrilled<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
preparation and he was thrilled with the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
preparation and he was thrilled with the
way<00:00:47.670> she<00:00:47.820> felt<00:00:47.940> under<00:00:48.180> E<00:00:48.239> she<00:00:48.899> did<00:00:49.020> seem<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
way she felt under E she did seem to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
way she felt under E she did seem to
amble<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> gates<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.340> diffraction

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
amble out of the gates is diffraction

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
amble out of the gates is diffraction
but<00:00:51.480> must<00:00:51.690> ups<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.410> early<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but must ups be really early in the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
but must ups be really early in the
trial<00:00:53.010> yeah<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.760> she<00:00:53.850> rolled<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> little

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
trial yeah well she rolled in a little

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
trial yeah well she rolled in a little
bit<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.350> open<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bit from the start because they open the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
bit from the start because they open the
outside<00:00:55.829> fence<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.699> probably<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
outside fence here and that probably is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.549 
outside fence here and that probably is
a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.750> distorted<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.469> she

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a little bit distorted you think she

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.810 
a little bit distorted you think she
missed<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> kick<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> couple<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.430> lengths<00:00:59.670> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
missed the kick a couple of lengths but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
missed the kick a couple of lengths but
there<00:01:00.059> Luke<00:01:00.210> said<00:01:00.390> she<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.930> rolled

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
there Luke said she actually just rolled

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
there Luke said she actually just rolled
in<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.590> bit<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.859> he<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.699> let<00:01:02.820> her

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
in a little bit and he just let her

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
in a little bit and he just let her
balance<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.300> before<00:01:03.600> she<00:01:03.690> rolled<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
balance up before she rolled into the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.830 
balance up before she rolled into the
trial<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.880> now<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.030> good

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
trial so now all good

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
trial so now all good
full<00:01:07.560> steam<00:01:07.740> ahead<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> coffee<00:01:08.280> along<00:01:08.520> into

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
full steam ahead to coffee along into

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
full steam ahead to coffee along into
the<00:01:09.299> last<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.320> daylight

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the last time over here in daylight

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.969 
the last time over here in daylight
you'll<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.280> give<00:01:11.430> her<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> normal<00:01:11.880> galaxy

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
you'll just give her a normal galaxy

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.300 
you'll just give her a normal galaxy
field<00:01:13.979> here

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
field here

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.050

it's<00:01:14.580> morning<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.939> until<00:01:15.020> corgis<00:01:16.020> day<00:01:20.060> the

it's morning up until corgis day the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's morning up until corgis day the
track<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.540> she'll<00:01:21.689> probably<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> nice

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
but look we through a set of our winkers

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.950 
but look we through a set of our winkers
on<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.880> morning<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> try<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> tweak

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
on in this morning just to try and tweak

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
on in this morning just to try and tweak
the<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.619> sort<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> habit<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.579> he's<00:01:53.670> got

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the little sort of habit that he's got

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.030 
the little sort of habit that he's got
of<00:01:54.030> flopping<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> barriers<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.380> not

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
of flopping out at the barriers and not

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.679 
of flopping out at the barriers and not
getting<00:01:56.219> running<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.820> poly<00:01:57.240> furlong

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
getting running the first poly furlong

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.660 
getting running the first poly furlong
so<00:01:57.960> give<00:01:58.590> him<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.890> bit<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> shake-up<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so give him a little bit of a shake-up I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
so give him a little bit of a shake-up I
think<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.600> enough<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:02.130> suggest<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
think it was enough to to suggest that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.690 
think it was enough to to suggest that
he<00:02:02.700> he<00:02:03.000> wants<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> he<00:02:05.070> didn't<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.549> too

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
he he wants them on but he didn't do too

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
he he wants them on but he didn't do too
much<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.030> after<00:02:06.299> he'd<00:02:06.420> gone<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> furlong<00:02:06.990> fell

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
much like after he'd gone a furlong fell

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
much like after he'd gone a furlong fell
in<00:02:07.439> half<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.770> sort<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> shut<00:02:08.220> him<00:02:08.340> down

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
in half I sort of shut him down

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
in half I sort of shut him down
just<00:02:09.330> letting<00:02:09.509> try<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:10.020> within<00:02:10.170> himself

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just letting try well within himself

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.839 
just letting try well within himself
because<00:02:10.830> he<00:02:10.920> did<00:02:11.039> race<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.489> Saturday

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
because he did race here on Saturday

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
because he did race here on Saturday
only<00:02:12.060> three<00:02:12.270> days<00:02:12.420> ago<00:02:12.599> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
only three days ago so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
only three days ago so
but<00:02:13.530> yeah<00:02:13.680> happy<00:02:14.100> with<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.460> little<00:02:14.970> tweak

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
but yeah happy with the little tweak

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.810 
but yeah happy with the little tweak
that<00:02:15.960> we're<00:02:16.080> getting<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:17.190> alone<00:02:17.460> racing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
that we're getting that alone racing

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.250 
that we're getting that alone racing
settle<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.450> jumping<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.900> morning

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
settle and then jumping up this morning

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.870 
settle and then jumping up this morning
indicates<00:02:19.650> probably<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.340> didn't<00:02:20.580> take<00:02:20.730> much

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
indicates probably they didn't take much

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.090 
indicates probably they didn't take much
feel<00:02:21.030> effect<00:02:21.270> from<00:02:21.360> settlers<00:02:21.690> run<00:02:21.920> yeah<00:02:22.920> look

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
feel effect from settlers run yeah look

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
feel effect from settlers run yeah look
I<00:02:23.190> mean<00:02:23.370> obviously<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.510> first<00:02:24.750> time

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
I mean obviously it's the first time

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.670 
I mean obviously it's the first time
I've<00:02:25.080> seen<00:02:26.570> for<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.600> few<00:02:27.780> weeks<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.230> he

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I've seen for a few weeks now but he

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.350 
I've seen for a few weeks now but he
looks<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.130> done<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.240> so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
looks to have done really really well so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
looks to have done really really well so
he<00:02:30.900> didn't<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> great<00:02:31.440> deal<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.620> luck<00:02:31.770> on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
he didn't have a great deal of luck on

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.590 
he didn't have a great deal of luck on
the<00:02:31.980> weekend<00:02:32.340> he<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> little<00:02:33.300> bit<00:02:33.390> neutral

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the weekend he was a little bit neutral

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.110 
the weekend he was a little bit neutral
on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> men<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.200> gates<00:02:34.380> Britain<00:02:35.120> didn't

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
on the men of the gates Britain didn't

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.430 
on the men of the gates Britain didn't
really<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.420> into<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> race<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:36.990> any<00:02:37.110> stage

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
really get into the race at any stage

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430 
really get into the race at any stage
and<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:39.270> halfway<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.960> Australia<00:02:40.290> sort

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and when halfway down the Australia sort

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.410 
and when halfway down the Australia sort
of<00:02:40.530> run<00:02:40.620> up<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.920> few<00:02:41.310> dead<00:02:41.460> ends<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.910> didn't

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
of run up a few dead ends and didn't

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.370 
of run up a few dead ends and didn't
have<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> lot<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.690> luck<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.050> he<00:02:43.110> didn't

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
have a lot of luck so he didn't

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.220 
have a lot of luck so he didn't
obviously<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.860> too<00:02:44.040> much<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:45.230> wasn't

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
obviously do too much so it wasn't

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
obviously do too much so it wasn't
surprising<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.830> Anthony<00:02:47.220> elected<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> try

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
surprising that Anthony elected to try

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.160 
surprising that Anthony elected to try
and<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.360> morning<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.750> don't<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.110> was

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
and this morning I don't think it was

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.130 
and this morning I don't think it was
ideal<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.270> he<00:02:51.270> seems<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.750> done<00:02:51.930> very

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
ideal but he seems to have done very

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.860 
ideal but he seems to have done very
very<00:02:52.230> well<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.710> there<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.630> he<00:02:54.630> didn't

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
very well from there on and he didn't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.360 
very well from there on and he didn't
get<00:02:54.990> too<00:02:55.110> much<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> trial<00:02:55.680> well<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> was

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
get too much in the trial well that was

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.650 
get too much in the trial well that was
