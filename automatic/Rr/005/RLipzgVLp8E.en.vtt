00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.839
 a half-team makeover for 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.839
 betting on young things is my mind 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:29.369
 it bears the name of which is el pelado 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 not impeccable bardi arrives on the second 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 pole behind him 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.890
 martina martina bell ringer martino 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 bell puts my banal inside 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.770
 now she arrived an hour late 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.239
 each but we do not say too intimate 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 we have suffered spa discharged on 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.170
 sampling profits while we make you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 win to others carefully because 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.289
 now he will try to do something he has 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.879
 asked for the grebe paloschi turns paratona 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.630
 worth as much as a goal 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.540
 I am impressed I am impressed 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.140
 positive from the francesino dalle petit 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 bijoux command I commit immediately by yes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 always says young and French young people 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 I accept it is okay, indeed 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.220
 embraces the no I say we think of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 Italians before we always launch 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.759
 young people in our youth sectors 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.829
 this starts at the first game 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.720
 very the usual young people who begin 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.409
 you are years old it is right to be generous with 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:43.740
 with the young Romans it seems to me audition 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.049
 but good good good good ones are me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 apparently made of another one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.740
 family the names of the past is wonderful and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 so subtly understand 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.659
 I started just me who measures the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 winner were better we will tell you 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.729
 oh well always the usual rossellini 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.979
 he played in series this is how much 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.270
 it reveals 15 years I played in series to these 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.910
 this how many others have done 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.970
 times and not boiled milk were not from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.310
 round we were not worth telatin was that 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.140
 always say they were other theses like 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.410
 so many is not true 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 the good and the good zigo would be 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:33.209
 was a phenomenon now almost inside the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.510
 claims the subtle palatability 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:43.170
 but not everything can be in the case this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:47.720
 it's not good it's good attention I have 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.720
 said that this player is not good 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.510
 we want to be gratified having said that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.490
 does not seem to me a mild purple phenomenon that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.750
 you have one that pulls me from forty meters 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.160
 almost the whole meeting and the panic took place 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 with ease where your doubts are 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.220
 but also when he was shooting nara 30
