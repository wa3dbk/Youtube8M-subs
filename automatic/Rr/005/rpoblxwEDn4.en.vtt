sort<00:00:27.289> of<00:00:27.350> weather<00:00:27.529> proofing<00:00:27.949> is<00:00:28.070> good

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
sort of weather proofing is good

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.420 
sort of weather proofing is good
it's<00:00:29.240> got<00:00:29.420> fire<00:00:29.660> retardant<00:00:30.140> material<00:00:30.680> and

it's got fire retardant material and
then<00:00:31.609> it<00:00:31.730> features<00:00:32.119> their<00:00:32.269> tension<00:00:32.719> band

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
then it features their tension band

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.960 
then it features their tension band
painted<00:00:33.530> attention<00:00:34.010> band<00:00:34.190> system<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:34.789> the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
painted attention band system so the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.520 
painted attention band system so the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.670 
formation there's no poles crossing each
other<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.850> make<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:41.239> strong<00:00:42.140> as<00:00:42.290> they<00:00:42.440> can

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
other so to make this strong as they can

other so to make this strong as they can
what<00:00:42.950> they've<00:00:43.070> done<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.370> they've<00:00:43.520> added<00:00:43.640> this

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
what they've done is they've added this

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.389 
what they've done is they've added this
tension<00:00:44.600> band<00:00:44.989> feature<00:00:45.320> which<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.219> just

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
tension band feature which you can just

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.549 
tension band feature which you can just
tension<00:00:46.579> up<00:00:46.880> and<00:00:47.059> allow<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.840> be<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> bit<00:00:48.379> more

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
tension up and allow it to be a bit more

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.250 
tension up and allow it to be a bit more

bathtub so for those people that are
looking<00:01:09.170> for<00:01:09.380> something<00:01:09.560> where<00:01:10.340> there's

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
looking for something where there's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.099 
looking for something where there's
plenty<00:01:10.639> of<00:01:10.819> ventilation<00:01:11.029> running<00:01:11.749> through<00:01:11.929> so

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
plenty of ventilation running through so

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.809 
plenty of ventilation running through so
if<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.259> does<00:01:12.499> get<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.679> bit<00:01:12.829> hot<00:01:13.130> or<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.399> bit<00:01:13.579> clammy

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
if it does get a bit hot or a bit clammy

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.639 
if it does get a bit hot or a bit clammy
there's<00:01:14.630> ventilation<00:01:14.810> running<00:01:15.439> through

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
there's ventilation running through

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.339 
there's ventilation running through
sometimes<00:01:16.039> with<00:01:16.429> the<00:01:16.609> with<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.509> fully<00:01:18.049> sewn

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:18.349 
sometimes with the with the fully sewn

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:19.629 
sometimes with the with the fully sewn
in<00:01:18.499> ground<00:01:18.770> chutes<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.130> can<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.549> little

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
in ground chutes you can get a little

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:20.830 
in ground chutes you can get a little
bit<00:01:19.789> hot<00:01:19.999> in<00:01:20.029> there<00:01:20.299> there's<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.659> enough

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
bit hot in there there's not enough

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.389 
bit hot in there there's not enough
ventilation<00:01:21.469> so<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.740> one<00:01:21.889> does<00:01:22.069> have<00:01:22.099> a<00:01:22.279> bit

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
ventilation so this one does have a bit

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.039 
ventilation so this one does have a bit
of<00:01:22.459> ventilation<00:01:22.639> and<00:01:23.209> then<00:01:23.749> you've<00:01:23.869> got<00:01:23.959> this

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
of ventilation and then you've got this

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.349 
of ventilation and then you've got this
brilliant<00:01:24.289> little<00:01:24.619> canopy<00:01:24.979> pole<00:01:25.359> weather

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
brilliant little canopy pole weather

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.749 
brilliant little canopy pole weather
weather<00:01:26.990> some<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.799> temps<00:01:28.069> go<00:01:28.219> backwards

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
weather some of the temps go backwards

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.089 
weather some of the temps go backwards
as<00:01:29.359> they<00:01:29.539> come<00:01:29.749> up<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.349> front<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.770> can<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.069> a

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
as they come up the front you can get a

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.469 
as they come up the front you can get a
bit<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.340> leakage<00:01:31.579> when<00:01:31.969> you've<00:01:32.119> got<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.299> door

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
bit of leakage when you've got the door

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.419 
bit of leakage when you've got the door
open<00:01:32.779> and<00:01:32.899> you<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.020> rain<00:01:33.649> will<00:01:33.859> just<00:01:33.979> pour<00:01:34.219> in

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
open and you just rain will just pour in

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.370 
open and you just rain will just pour in
there<00:01:34.639> so<00:01:34.849> this<00:01:34.969> canopy<00:01:35.359> stops<00:01:36.169> that<00:01:36.349> from

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there so this canopy stops that from

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.050 
there so this canopy stops that from
happening<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:37.459> gives<00:01:37.639> you<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.759> bit<00:01:37.939> of

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
happening and just gives you a bit of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.889 
happening and just gives you a bit of
extra<00:01:38.389> weather<00:01:39.020> protection<00:01:40.179> where<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.329> poles

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
extra weather protection where the poles

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.269 
extra weather protection where the poles
run<00:01:42.169> into<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.469> middle<00:01:42.590> as<00:01:42.770> well<00:01:42.799> they're<00:01:43.099> in<00:01:43.189> a
