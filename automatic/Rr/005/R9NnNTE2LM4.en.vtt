00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
think they'll all come down chance for

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.110 
think they'll all come down chance for
three<00:01:01.920> cars<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.310> think<00:01:03.580> mom<00:01:03.910> will<00:01:04.030> probably

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
Martin back there for position he might

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.780 
Martin back there for position he might
take<00:01:11.500> two<00:01:11.710> yeah<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:14.320> very<00:01:14.440> hard<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.100> get

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
take two yeah very very hard to get

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.250 
take two yeah very very hard to get
through<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.150> field<00:01:16.420> when<00:01:16.870> they're<00:01:17.020> three
