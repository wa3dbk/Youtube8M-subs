00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
can figure things out that I couldn't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.810 
can figure things out that I couldn't
even<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.809> I<00:00:30.960> don't<00:00:31.139> think<00:00:31.829> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
even think of because I don't think in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.389 
even think of because I don't think in
the<00:00:33.690> matter<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> being<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.710> high<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.129> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
towels well with that wall we lifted the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.520 
towels well with that wall we lifted the
large<00:01:04.199> packages<00:01:05.119> up<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> ceiling<00:01:07.110> space

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
large packages up into the ceiling space

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
large packages up into the ceiling space
that's<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.340> empty<00:01:09.060> space<00:01:09.329> we<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that's just empty space we all have that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
that's just empty space we all have that
space<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:12.030> can't<00:01:12.270> ever<00:01:12.390> do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
space we all know we can't ever do

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
space we all know we can't ever do
anything<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.770> waste

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
anything with it and it's just a waste

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
anything with it and it's just a waste
because<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.759> know<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.270> easily<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
because you know we can easily use that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
because you know we can easily use that
for<00:01:16.259> something<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:18.090> did<00:01:19.280> how<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> stays<00:01:20.670> up

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
for something so we did how it stays up

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
for something so we did how it stays up
there<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.329> pack<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> actually<00:01:22.110> supported

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
there is the pack is actually supported

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.130 
there is the pack is actually supported
by<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> wall<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.579> sits<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.420> doorframe

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
by the wall and it sits on the doorframe
on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> inside<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> closet<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.729> therefore

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on the inside of the closet so therefore

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
on the inside of the closet so therefore
it<00:01:27.299> doesn't<00:01:27.570> fall<00:01:27.869> let<00:01:28.530> me<00:01:28.619> show<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.950> I'm
