person who wants to learn some farming
skills<00:02:09.140> we'd<00:02:09.410> love<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:09.800> them<00:02:09.850> work<00:02:10.850> with

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
us and learn from us but other than that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.170 
us and learn from us but other than that
we<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.250> aren't<00:02:13.520> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.730> get<00:02:13.790> much<00:02:13.970> bigger

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
we we aren't going to get much bigger

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.150 
we we aren't going to get much bigger
but<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> think<00:02:15.380> there's<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> lot<00:02:16.010> of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
but I think there's a lot of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
but I think there's a lot of
opportunities<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.850> there<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.090> any<00:02:17.600> other

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
opportunities out there for any other

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.020 
opportunities out there for any other
people<00:02:18.320> who<00:02:18.440> are<00:02:18.500> starting<00:02:18.770> farming<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.610> CSA

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
people who are starting farming the CSA

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.710 
people who are starting farming the CSA
is<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> wonderful<00:02:20.750> way<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:22.220> farm<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.330> your

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
is a wonderful way to to farm I you your

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.810 
is a wonderful way to to farm I you your
market<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.140> guaranteed<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.340> don't<00:02:25.580> need<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
market is guaranteed you don't need a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.080 
market is guaranteed you don't need a
lot<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.270> inputs<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.750> start<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.320> need<00:02:27.500> land<00:02:28.090> but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
lot of inputs to start you need land but

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.820 
lot of inputs to start you need land but
there's<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:29.750> many<00:02:29.840> ways<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.410> people<00:02:30.470> can

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
there's so many ways that people can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.410 
there's so many ways that people can
connect<00:02:31.100> with<00:02:31.160> land<00:02:31.459> if<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.760> don't<00:02:31.910> buy<00:02:32.060> land

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
connect with land if you don't buy land

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.910 
connect with land if you don't buy land
there's<00:02:32.660> land<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.230> rent<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.709> borrow

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
there's land that you can rent or borrow

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.530 
there's land that you can rent or borrow
or<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.730> know<00:02:34.820> work<00:02:35.000> out<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.300> different

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
or you know work out some different

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.229 
or you know work out some different
arrangements<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.440> think<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.760> CSA<00:02:38.150> is

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
arrangements so I think that the CSA is

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.840 
arrangements so I think that the CSA is
a<00:02:38.269> very<00:02:38.600> popular<00:02:39.260> model<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:40.190> consumers

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
a very popular model for consumers

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.820 
a very popular model for consumers
because<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.450> know<00:02:41.600> they're<00:02:41.840> getting<00:02:42.019> fresh

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
because they know they're getting fresh

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.430 
because they know they're getting fresh
produce<00:02:43.269> they<00:02:44.269> visit<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> farm<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.320> they<00:02:45.380> see

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
produce they visit the farm and they see

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.350 
produce they visit the farm and they see
that<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.190> know<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.459> grown<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.030> food<00:02:47.209> is

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
that you know it's grown the food is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.280 
that you know it's grown the food is
grown<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.840> way<00:02:47.959> that's<00:02:48.170> sustainable

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
grown in a way that's sustainable

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.520
