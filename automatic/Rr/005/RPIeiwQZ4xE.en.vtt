00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hi everyone, I'm glad I've been surprised today I have been using it recently 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.059
 I'm thinking of introducing earpieces 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 The model number of td 9 a is pep 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.020
 When it says hyphen bk wh 8 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.510
 It's long, but it's a fit wing or chair spare 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.480
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 But it saved for the package because they are you are using to buy the other this original yourself 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 Originally earpiece of you that comes with some of the earphone of even this is Hey td management 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640
 Though 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.700
 A normal shape that other manufacturers can offer 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.160
 Some with earpieces 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.900
 It is said that the pit wing is in the name which is different from the big one 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.330
 Wing a special child 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:56.570
 In other words, it's a feather, and it has a structure that has grown up, so now it's a bit on hand 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:01.340
 Do you know though is Kaiserslautern attached to earphones 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.480
 I think that a normal earpiece is sympathetic like this, but its dome shape 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.670
 Further from the part of the umbrella 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.950
 Something like one more step is growing towards 82 directions. 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:19.979
 This is the shape that is said to be fit wing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.200
 Well, it's like an earpiece and it 's attached like a stem of a park-like column-shaped earphone 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.780
 Because 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 Though it'll be rotated wonder if I say with this Ugo of long wings and short wings length 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:40.100
 I planted these long feathers 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.190
 Wear it in the earphone with a short bone and put it in this ear 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.620
 If it comes to the wind 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:51.510
 In contrast to the conventional dome-shaped earpieces of the prior art 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.690
 Therefore, with a feature that very stable and easy at the time was Mimie 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.240
 It is a cure piece 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:04.490
 To say that Riapisu this without the size of the system of itself 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.310
 It corresponds to the size of about No. 400 and No. 500 in the earpieces of comp 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.680
 Because aadd Kei is ya 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.710
 Unexpectedly, it can be used fairly widely, and the earphone with which it is just this is Kore 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.960
 jvc 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.080
 Victor is hf xt 200 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.560
 Others 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:29.250
 In this recently under under 5000 yen I am in the No. 1 choice of good earphones now 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:36.840
 I'm also shining in the mix of love x-ray and so on 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.640
 Actually I can put it on my i- x-ray and this hand-held mountain hnf xt 200 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.120
 Is 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.880
 This TV-based fit wing or piste 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 Actually I have put one more 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.940
 Audio Technica's ad jai m 50 also uses that for a while 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.700
 There is a sound and a book, but this is not actually attached to this 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:05.450
 I mentioned earlier how I said it 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 For the fx t 200 ix game it is in the form of a fairly ordinary ordinary earphone 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.739
 Because 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.510
 This is all you need to do is plug it into your ear 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:18.690
 On the contrary, im 50 has the same shape as the ear monitor 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:24.120
 If this is said to be true, we have to live in the depths of that ear 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:28.530
 Well , the earpieces with a good fit are two-tiered umbrellas so I can listen to my ears 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.360
 Brake I'm stalls get at the second stage of the umbrella-consuming as to when inserted 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:38.710
 Wearing large m 52 of a state of in, but the other attached itself I can be 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 If you push it down to the optimum depth for im 50, the second stage umbrella will 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:48.280
 It gets in the way a little and distorts the earpiece itself 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:52.650
 By Then, such as that sound insulation and can gap is falling economy that will occur 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:57.110
 even though I think the fit it is by im 50 course of human 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.960
 Because if a little place in my meaning was not so good 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.540
 Oh How Well yeah it is this fact 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:09.180
 tep bk wh 8 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.810
 There are 3 sizes, and there are different sizes of goose ssm and soa 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.780
 Also 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:23.560
 If it is m size per package, it sells in m size and it is 4 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:25.010
 Color is in black and white a pair is included a total of 4 pairs of 2 pairs each 4 models 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.350
 Try it once 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:35.210
 It can also so well it's like you just introduce and this eye X-ray be asked 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:41.000
 A little with the standard earpieces that came with you 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:44.600
 If I could have the impression that say Naa insecure to fit Toka arcade either of t 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.030
 I am trying because the type what I described earpiece of the earphone, such as Well adapted to other 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.770
 Have 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.759
 It is better if you try it on other models once 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.449
 Because it might state that the earphone is stable hard to miss 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:00.069
 We have the end high that 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.569
 That from before Warner was saying, also in the audience of your visit to this and strong art 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:06.729
 I'm happy 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:08.120
 You because I think that if you come once you try it is the person having problems with your earpiece something 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.250
 I wish 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:17.169
 Yes, today is the earpiece of tvk , let me introduce you to Kurito Wing Ear Fiss 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:21.669
