00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.370 
the 1930s uh trying to mimic DreamWorks
Animation<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.090> odd<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.720> watch<00:02:56.930> I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
Animation it's just so odd to watch I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.920 
Animation it's just so odd to watch I
mean<00:02:57.740> this<00:02:58.100> isn't<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.490> bad<00:02:58.730> trailer<00:02:59.210> it's<00:02:59.660> just

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
mean this isn't a bad trailer it's just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.860 
mean this isn't a bad trailer it's just
so<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.260> what<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.440> wanted<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:01.310> uh<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:02.540> very

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
so not what I wanted it to be uh it very

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.140 
so not what I wanted it to be uh it very
much<00:03:03.080> seems<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.590> me<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.800> be<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.340> tangled<00:03:04.910> -

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
much seems to me to be like a tangled -

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.320 
much seems to me to be like a tangled -
so<00:03:06.140> derivative<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.830> tangled<00:03:07.460> even<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.210> way

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
so derivative of tangled even the way

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.300 
so derivative of tangled even the way
arendelle<00:03:08.840> looks<00:03:08.870> before<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.680> frost<00:03:09.950> hits

looks<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.900> could<00:03:12.110> be<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.260> stand-in

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
looks it's this it could be a stand-in

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.190 
looks it's this it could be a stand-in
for<00:03:12.830> Rapunzel's<00:03:13.550> village<00:03:13.940> entangled<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.840> I

that is no animated adventure is a

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.820 
that is no animated adventure is a

fantastic idea with all the ice and the
snow<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.070> think<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.430> could<00:05:27.550> be<00:05:27.580> fantastic<00:05:28.560> but

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560
