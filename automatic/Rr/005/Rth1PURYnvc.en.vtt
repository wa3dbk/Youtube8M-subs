you<00:00:07.440> can<00:00:07.620> tell<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.099> my<00:00:08.269> 2006<00:00:09.269> g6<00:00:09.809> our<00:00:09.990> 600

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
you can tell this is my 2006 g6 our 600

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.610 
you can tell this is my 2006 g6 our 600
engine<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.480> I<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.690> put<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.019> taking<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.469> out

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
engine and I have put it taking it out

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.480 
engine and I have put it taking it out
because<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.950> did<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.400> leak<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:15.109> right<00:00:16.109> here

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
because I did have a leak on right here

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.040 
because I did have a leak on right here
with<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> tension<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.510> goes

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
with the tension it goes

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.260 
with the tension it goes
I<00:00:19.080> suppose<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.490> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.789> gasket

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I suppose I have some kind of gasket

I suppose I have some kind of gasket
didn't<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> make<00:00:23.160> one

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
didn't have one I'm going to make one

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
didn't have one I'm going to make one
right<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.670> probably<00:00:23.910> at<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> silicone<00:00:24.689> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
right now is probably at a silicone in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.179 
right now is probably at a silicone in
any<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.900> take<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.740> brackets

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
both sides in front you will have these

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
both sides in front you will have these
camshafts<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.610> Dynamo<00:00:33.030> correct<00:00:33.360> we've<00:00:33.540> got

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
camshafts the Dynamo correct we've got

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.990 
camshafts the Dynamo correct we've got
to<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.260> three<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.010> intake<00:00:35.370> side<00:00:35.700> up

right here this tab has to line up with
that<00:01:17.700> line<00:01:18.619> just<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.759> lines<00:01:21.659> off

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that line just just like that lines off

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
that line just just like that lines off
probably<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:23.580> half<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.030> two

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
probably about it maybe half or two

toward mania to is not a very big deal
probably<00:01:28.020> cuz<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> angle<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.740> much<00:01:28.950> phone

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
probably cuz the angle have much phone

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.109 
probably cuz the angle have much phone
