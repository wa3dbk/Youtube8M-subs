00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
in a societal sense and then she's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.350 
in a societal sense and then she's

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
think it's a really good modernization

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.409 
think it's a really good modernization
of<00:04:29.430> something<00:04:29.700> very<00:04:29.850> classic<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:32.610> got<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
of something very classic it's got a

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.540 
of something very classic it's got a
very<00:04:33.750> alien<00:04:34.050> feel<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.010> while<00:04:35.340> being

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
very alien feel to it while being

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.050 
very alien feel to it while being
recognizable<00:04:36.270> as<00:04:36.450> as<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.410> suit<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.520> we<00:04:38.610> know

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
recognizable as as the suit that we know

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.920 
recognizable as as the suit that we know
and<00:04:39.240> love<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:41.300> think<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:43.410> brings<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:44.070> sort<00:04:44.490> of

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
and love I think it it brings a sort of

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.840 
and love I think it it brings a sort of
almost<00:04:45.930> like<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.139> testosterone<00:04:46.830> energy<00:04:47.490> to

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
almost like a testosterone energy to

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.570 
almost like a testosterone energy to
something<00:04:48.350> which<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.500> think<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.830> required<00:04:49.980> in

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
something which I think is required in

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.750 
something which I think is required in
today<00:04:51.330> in<00:04:51.630> today's<00:04:52.139> sort<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.680> movie<00:04:53.490> world

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
today in today's sort of movie world

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.080 
today in today's sort of movie world
because<00:04:54.360> everyone<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.740> used<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.220> things

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
because everyone is so used to things

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.810 
because everyone is so used to things
being<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.660> high<00:04:57.900> octane<00:04:58.350> in<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.280> a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.930 

visceral<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.450> news<00:05:03.950> movies<00:05:04.950> are<00:05:05.340> our

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
visceral in the news movies are our

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.480 
visceral in the news movies are our
fantasies<00:05:06.600> have<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.680> be<00:05:07.770> even<00:05:08.100> bigger<00:05:08.280> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
fantasies have to be even bigger and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.150 
fantasies have to be even bigger and
better<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:09.120> think<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.900> suit<00:05:10.169> lends

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
better and I think the suit lends

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.520 
better and I think the suit lends
something<00:05:11.700> of<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.389> this<00:05:12.600> it's<00:05:13.080> something

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
something of that to this it's something

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.629 
something of that to this it's something
which<00:05:13.950> is<00:05:14.000> exceptionally<00:05:15.000> cool<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
which is exceptionally cool and

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.450 
which is exceptionally cool and
otherworldly<00:05:17.639> at<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:17.940> same<00:05:18.150> time
