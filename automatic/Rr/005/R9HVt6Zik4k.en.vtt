field<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.420> car<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.900> very<00:02:19.380> very<00:02:19.770> realistic

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
field of the car is very very realistic

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.360 
field of the car is very very realistic
and<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:20.940> fun<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.110> dirt<00:02:22.890> fans<00:02:23.190> will

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370

have<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:23.820> good<00:02:23.970> time<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.510> one

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
have a really good time with this one

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.300 
have a really good time with this one
it's<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.960> nice<00:02:25.140> progression<00:02:25.440> from<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.190> they

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.300 
it's a nice progression from what they
played<00:02:26.580> before

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.900
