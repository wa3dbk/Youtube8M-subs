Hello, everyone!

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:06.330
This is Joao from Kenhub, and welcome to another
anatomy tutorial where, right now, we’re

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.280
going to be talking about the different arteries
and also nerves that you find on your foot.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.870
Right now, on your screen, we’re looking
at the plantar view of your foot where we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.730
can see, on the left side, the different arteries
that we’re going to be talking about on

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.900
this tutorial as well as the different nerves
that you see on the right side, on the image

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.199
on the right side.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.219
Now, as I just mentioned, then, we’re going
to be focusing on the main arteries and also

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.269
nerves that we find on your foot.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.739
Before we do so, let’s start out by listing
the different arteries that we’re going

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.739
to be covering.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.469
We’re going to talk about the dorsal artery
of the foot, the lateral and medial tarsal

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.370
arteries, the arcuate artery, also the dorsal
metatarsal arteries, the lateral and medial

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.459
plantar arteries, the deep plantar arch and,
finally, we’re going to also be talking

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.059
about the plantar metatarsal arteries.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.850
Now, let’s start…
