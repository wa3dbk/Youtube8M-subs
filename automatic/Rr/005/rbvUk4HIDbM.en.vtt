more<00:00:23.420> Klein<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.140> do<00:00:24.410> nothing<00:00:25.060> than<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.119> be

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
more Klein now to do nothing than to be

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.480 
more Klein now to do nothing than to be
proactive<00:00:27.020> and<00:00:27.140> I<00:00:27.349> can't<00:00:27.650> believe<00:00:27.800> if<00:00:28.160> I<00:00:28.310> was

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
proactive and I can't believe if I was

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.800 
proactive and I can't believe if I was
in<00:00:28.610> their<00:00:28.640> shoes<00:00:28.790> I'd<00:00:29.150> be<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.419> same<00:00:29.630> way

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
in their shoes I'd be the same way

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.810 
in their shoes I'd be the same way
because<00:00:30.380> they<00:00:30.529> realize<00:00:30.950> no<00:00:31.310> matter<00:00:31.340> what<00:00:31.790> they

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
because they realize no matter what they

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.060 
because they realize no matter what they
do<00:00:32.029> it's<00:00:32.810> going<00:00:33.079> to<00:00:33.110> be<00:00:33.260> analyzed<00:00:33.770> and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
do it's going to be analyzed and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.790 
do it's going to be analyzed and
scrutinized<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.970> death<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.450> always<00:00:36.200> put<00:00:36.470> in<00:00:36.680> a

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.740 
scrutinized to death and always put in a
negative<00:00:36.980> light<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:37.940> their<00:00:38.120> best<00:00:38.360> thing<00:00:38.600> is

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750
