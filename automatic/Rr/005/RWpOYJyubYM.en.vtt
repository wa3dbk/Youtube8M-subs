00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.759
 maybe summer comes and with it the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 ice cream so we're going to prepare this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.600
 vanilla ice cream the ingredients are 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.720
 milk 4 egg yolks sugar a 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.720
 thermometer that if you have a spoon there 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.760
 will be needed so you worry more and a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 vanilla pod and of course the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.020
 refrigerator, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.080
 Mix the sugar with the egg yolks 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.960
 it is important that you mix it well as 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.150
 it is usual in my night the ingredients 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 and the exact amounts are in the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.200
 description this ice cream is based on a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.870
 English cream is the most typical and the one that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.130
 gives better results in my opinion to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 continuation 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.840
 we heat the milk 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.320
 and I'm going to show you how to open the pod 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 of vanilla and get more out of it 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 As you can see, you have to make a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 incision in the middle of the scabbard and then 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.610
 very careful not to cut scrape 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.770
 to take out all the seeds once 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.710
 that we have it we will throw everything in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.190
 milk both the seeds and the pod 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.070
 After the pod you clean it and you can 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.340
 leave with sugar to make it a sugar 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.789
 vanilla when it has reached the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 boil milk always squeeze 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.140
 the on another bowl and then and then the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.990
 vertex on the previous mix is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 important to throw from little to little since 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 as the mixture is egg and milk 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 It is very hot because you can do the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 egg and we do not want an ice cream 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.440
 tortilla what we want is an ice cream 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.140
 vanilla that sounds similar but is not 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.670
 the same as always I tell you also 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 We are in crisis and we have to take 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.380
 absolutely everything 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.020
 once we have well incorporated 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 We'll throw the whole mixture in the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.340
 casserole the trick is to put a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.160
 spoon pass your finger and if you see that the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 mixture does not come together again is that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.810
 is observed list 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.840
 once you have the cold mixture already 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.739
 you throw on your refrigerator 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.650
 and for 30 minutes or so you'll have 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.080
 a similar texture now only missing 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.840
 serve and enjoy the warmth of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.950
 summer and as always I tell you if it has 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 liked to subscribe and nothing here is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.379
 dismisses mingo chef until the return of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.940
 Summer has been a pleasure and we see each other with 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.480
 more recipes in September a greeting and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 until next time
