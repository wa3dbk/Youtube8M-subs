00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
does this the spark on de Chaumont one

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.270 
does this the spark on de Chaumont one
so<00:01:14.210> yeah<00:01:15.210> maybe<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.170> say<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> few<00:01:16.890> words<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so yeah maybe you can say a few words I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
so yeah maybe you can say a few words I
can<00:01:17.670> explain<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> concept<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
can explain you the concept so it's a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
can explain you the concept so it's a
hybrid<00:01:19.979> drum<00:01:20.159> machine<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.090> see

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
hybrid drum machine so as you can see

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
hybrid drum machine so as you can see
you<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> midi<00:01:22.320> controller<00:01:22.790> understaffed

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you have a midi controller understaffed

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
you have a midi controller understaffed
where<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> software<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
where and you can use the software in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
where and you can use the software in
standalone<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
standalone like right now or in a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.780 
standalone like right now or in a
plug-in<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.829> integrate<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
plug-in so you can integrate it in the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.140 
plug-in so you can integrate it in the
extra<00:01:30.150> bass<00:01:30.770> pro<00:01:31.770> tools<00:01:32.009> Ableton<00:01:32.520> Live<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
extra bass pro tools Ableton Live and so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
extra bass pro tools Ableton Live and so
on<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> Sun<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.829> generated<00:01:35.310> by

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
on and so all the Sun is generated by

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.200 
on and so all the Sun is generated by
the<00:01:35.460> software<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.939> full<00:01:38.939> control

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the software and you have a full control

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
the software and you have a full control
over<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.659> beats<00:01:39.960> ok<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.829> everything<00:01:41.189> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
over your beats ok there everything is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700 
over your beats ok there everything is
pre<00:01:41.490> maps<00:01:41.729> from<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> controller<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pre maps from the controller so you can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
pre maps from the controller so you can
really<00:01:44.040> tweak<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:45.030> drums<00:01:47.270> ok<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> tune

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
really tweak your drums ok you can tune

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
really tweak your drums ok you can tune
everything<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.680> want<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.579> very

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
everything you want and it's very

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
everything you want and it's very
flexible<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:52.320> course<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.649> used

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
flexible because of course we used

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
flexible because of course we used
samples<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:54.540> kids<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.619> used<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
samples from for some kids but we used a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
samples from for some kids but we used a
lot<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.430> analogue<00:01:56.850> emulation<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:58.049> well<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
lot of analogue emulation as well so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310 
lot of analogue emulation as well so
what<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> hear<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> is<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.479> accumulation<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
what you hear is a is an accumulation of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.880 
what you hear is a is an accumulation of
the<00:02:01.640> 909<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> an<00:02:03.930> emulation<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.619> TR

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the 909 we also have an emulation of TR

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.720 
the 909 we also have an emulation of TR
I<00:02:04.950> 28

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.490 

okay<00:04:47.100> move<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.600> it's<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.080> great<00:04:49.290> way<00:04:49.440> to

okay move it's a it's a great way to

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.470 
okay move it's a it's a great way to
program<00:04:50.070> beats<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.670> you<00:04:51.000> don't<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.300> to

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
program beats and you don't have to

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.390 
program beats and you don't have to
watch<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:52.380> monitor<00:04:52.770> all<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.070> time<00:04:53.250> you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
watch the monitor all the time you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.490 
watch the monitor all the time you
basically<00:04:53.730> just<00:04:53.820> watch<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.570> yeah<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.080> can<00:04:55.350> do

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
basically just watch the yeah you can do

everything<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.070> machine<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.460> then<00:04:56.820> if

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
everything on the machine and then if

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.810 
everything on the machine and then if
you<00:04:57.690> want<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.140> fine<00:04:58.560> tune<00:04:58.590> what<00:04:59.190> you've<00:04:59.640> done

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
you want to fine tune what you've done

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.480 
you want to fine tune what you've done
you<00:05:00.480> can<00:05:00.630> access<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.560> upper<00:05:01.860> view<00:05:02.040> okay

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
you can access the the upper view okay

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.850 
you can access the the upper view okay
and<00:05:02.730> that's<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.350> sequencer<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.560> software

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
and that's a sequencer of the software

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.630 
and that's a sequencer of the software
so<00:05:05.310> it's<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.380> saves<00:05:07.380> everything<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.280> program

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
so it's a saves everything you program

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.950 
so it's a saves everything you program
and<00:05:08.940> then<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:10.200> can<00:05:10.350> also<00:05:10.500> access<00:05:10.770> all<00:05:11.190> your

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
and then you can also access all your

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.830 
and then you can also access all your
settings<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.350> automation<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.840> fine-tune

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
settings and automation and fine-tune

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.040 
settings and automation and fine-tune
them<00:05:16.020> break<00:05:16.380> them<00:05:16.620> afterwards<00:05:17.600> so<00:05:18.600> that's<00:05:18.870> a

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
them break them afterwards so that's a

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.250 
them break them afterwards so that's a
