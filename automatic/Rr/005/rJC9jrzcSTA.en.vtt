00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 nice guys welcome today in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.589
 this new video and today we are the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.530
 review of kakà and it is probably the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.389
 double occupied day that ad 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 some of you promised a card of yours 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 facebook page but we had said 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 that I would have made some double pat ha 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 since I was in this period 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.660
 not very active then as you can see 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 these kakas iv 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 I apologize also because today on Monday I 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 I'll get the reviews out 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.210
 how much less important are Fridays or 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 Thursday that is Friday more than anything else 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 minor on Saturday 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.750
 this loads on Monday though many of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 you have asked me for my opinion on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 what is kaka I can tell you a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.850
 hot an opinion is really terrific and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 the credits I spent are worth it 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.969
 how can you see that team one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 4 3 3 with coc then 43 34 really 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 really very strong him and balotelli 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.469
 make a couple really absurd and in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.059
 I put that position in that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.360
 position to take advantage of even the very 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.299
 his shot or future flaws that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.820
 now I'm going to tell you then let's start 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 from the pros that are really so many 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 really lots of guys 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.049
 the first pro is ball control then 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.070
 first of all we have 86 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.650
 on the dribbling card on a card 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 instead of statistics we have 91 's 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 against the ball is a 89 i dribbling 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 let's say I promise ball control but 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 it's all in the circle of dribbling 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.700
 so we have a great dribbling that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.640
 among other things it is accompanied by four 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.590
 star screen on this is a great one 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.329
 which obviously must have over a good 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 dribbling also a very good control 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.270
 ball and he to these statistics a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.180
 other pro besides going dribbling to the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.189
 shooting around and long shot then did not 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.770
 put all the shot because it has some 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 flaws that are quite serious 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.630
 as far as I'm concerned 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.460
 then the turn 93 curve, that is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.009
 Shooting around the fan shop so many of you 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.710
 they told me not so many one who has 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.500
 said he speaks in Italian or 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.270
 don't say find shot ball control these 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.900
 words in English that you may not 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.510
 understand 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 then I'll tell you in Italian 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.490
 since they are so in capibili shooting a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.500
 lap 93 and long shot 92 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.500
 really very high statistics for kaka 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.820
 it's really at stake 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.450
 very much I noticed that from nif to kakà 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.880
 iv we have an improvement as far as 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.160
 concerns the speed in the nifo found 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.790
 that the player was much more static 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 and lost the ball a lot more times 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.400
 instead in the iv I noticed a check of 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.400
 much more and much better ball in short 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.520
 it is a more than excellent finalization 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.450
 however long shot long shot long shot 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:14.130
 90 so a lot but the long shot is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:16.890
 a bit like saying bewitched by an 81 shop 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.660
 power that will now tell you for 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.390
 regarding work at falling 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.830
 among the pros we have neither glow then to the blues 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.380
 for a co they do us half good to me 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.660
 they are very fine indeed 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.180
 usual show should have us at mediums 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.000
 but it's really really good 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.000
 because thanks to this heigl we have it 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.270
 besides we always have the attack 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.190
 always in the midst of action and always at the 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.440
 right place at the right time even a 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.050
 78 positioning that is not 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.570
 very much so 3 pros we have both 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.860
 positioning that work network and thanks to 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.840
 this work for you thanks to his 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.160
 positioning makes many but many more goals 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.780
 of robbery 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.580
 so great really great 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.430
 among other things we have network work 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.850
 positioning 3 pro and long passage e 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.280
 short has a 79 of long passing that a 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.690
 my opinion really looks much higher 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.220
 as a statistic it seems more like an 85 I have 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.620
 really found very well with the passage 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.660
 cocoa or a great passage that yes 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.440
 it does not refer that does not shine 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.419
 precisely to 82 it is reflected more than 85 of 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.000
 passage for kakà 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.130
 in addition to an 89 share passing 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.550
 so a short pass is fine 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.880
 thus 3 pro also fall into the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.250
 skill mus and the whif fruits that is 4 and 4 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.770
 which is really really great 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.330
 great great 8 many ways 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.640
 he is a right and with the left does 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.919
 really massacres 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.580
 we pass the first against is the 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.010
 encounter power more I feel 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.790
 to give more to kakà but we have the 81 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.840
 in shop power that really doesn't seem like it 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.270
 precisely 81 81 the many we know has not 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.520
 a simple powerful shot not even not 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.430
 powerful if he had a powerful kaka shot 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.640
 it would be the miur coc one of the miur cc 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.000
 the game unfortunately it is not so 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.039
 among the pros, the shooting power 3 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.150
 It lasts between against the counter on between 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:30.710
 against also the strength 1 86 and 62 of 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 strength 1 86 62 distant strength 62 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.229
 I don't like a cerci with little 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.050
 strength a physical game for a 62 of 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.700
 strength is not good then one of the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.260
 against kakà , thank goodness he has some 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.669
 a bit of tonnage because if not really 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.470
 would make a gigantic encounter and then i 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.000
 three against also the agility then for 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.729
 regarding the speed of kakà 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.950
 we have an acceleration is good because 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.000
 when it's really good 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.160
 it really looks fast though when you have to 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.020
 leave them a bit of agility 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.820
 balancing in fact I entered them 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.190
 at least inserted agility or against 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.230
 I hope this review is there 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.780
 liked I invite you to leave a nice me 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.040

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.440
