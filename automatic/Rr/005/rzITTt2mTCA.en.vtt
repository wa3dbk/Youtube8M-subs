appreciated so here is a look at the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.810 
appreciated so here is a look at the
shoes<00:00:46.110> themselves<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.070> definitely<00:00:47.610> an

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
shoes themselves this is definitely an

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
shoes themselves this is definitely an
interesting<00:00:48.090> color<00:00:48.539> I've<00:00:48.809> never<00:00:49.110> seen<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
interesting color I've never seen a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
interesting color I've never seen a
colorway<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> before<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> pair<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
colorway like this before on a pair of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.760 
colorway like this before on a pair of
soccer<00:00:51.329> shoes<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
soccer shoes and I think it's one of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.959 
soccer shoes and I think it's one of
those<00:00:52.890> colors<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.670> people<00:00:53.879> are

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
those colors that a lot of people are

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
those colors that a lot of people are
going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> love<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> people<00:00:55.379> are

going to love and a lot of people are

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.810

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
personally I'm a big fan of this color

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
personally I'm a big fan of this color
it<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> kind<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> tonal<00:01:03.359> theme<00:01:03.539> going

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it has that kind of tonal theme going

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
it has that kind of tonal theme going
where<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> Neo<00:01:04.589> lime<00:01:04.949> acting<00:01:05.729> as

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
where you have the Neo lime acting as

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
where you have the Neo lime acting as
the<00:01:06.000> darkest<00:01:06.420> green<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.290> fades<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the darkest green and then it fades to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
the darkest green and then it fades to
that<00:01:08.070> fresh<00:01:08.400> mint<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.970> light<00:01:09.240> green<00:01:09.540> which

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that fresh mint very light green which

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
that fresh mint very light green which
fades<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> white<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
fades to the white then you have the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
fades to the white then you have the
Block<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> swoosh<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
Block in the swoosh as well as at the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
Block in the swoosh as well as at the
heel<00:01:13.650> acting<00:01:14.430> has<00:01:14.580> somewhat<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.119> accent

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
heel acting has somewhat of an accent

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
heel acting has somewhat of an accent
color<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.409> looks<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.979> really

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
color which I think looks really really

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:17.570 
color which I think looks really really
good

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
good

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
good

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
personally I'm a big fan and I like that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.810 
personally I'm a big fan and I like that
they're<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> giving<00:01:20.100> us<00:01:20.220> new<00:01:20.400> color<00:01:20.640> ways

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
they're kind of giving us new color ways

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
they're kind of giving us new color ways
that<00:01:21.000> we've<00:01:21.090> never<00:01:21.299> seen<00:01:21.630> before<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.560> fresh

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

that we've never seen before the fresh
mint<00:01:23.009> color<00:01:23.250> definitely<00:01:23.580> looks<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:23.970> bit

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
mint color definitely looks a little bit

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
mint color definitely looks a little bit
different<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.600> person<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.740> necessarily

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
different in person it's not necessarily

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.349 
kind of going off of them there just to
give<00:02:53.519> them<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.670> little<00:02:53.790> bit<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.269> an

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
give them a little bit more of an

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.300 
give them a little bit more of an
aggressive<00:02:54.450> feel<00:02:55.049> they<00:02:55.739> don't<00:02:55.859> really<00:02:56.099> change

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
aggressive feel they don't really change

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
aggressive feel they don't really change
the<00:02:56.519> overall<00:02:56.849> feel<00:02:57.120> when<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:57.450> are<00:02:57.569> passing

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the overall feel when you are passing

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.270 
the overall feel when you are passing
and<00:02:58.139> receiving<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.530> ball<00:02:58.709> all<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:59.099> much

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
and receiving the ball all that much

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.039 
and receiving the ball all that much
other<00:02:59.760> than<00:02:59.909> just<00:03:00.239> adding<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.689> little<00:03:00.840> bit<00:03:00.959> more

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
other than just adding a little bit more

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.170 
other than just adding a little bit more
grip<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:01.920> overall<00:03:02.189> it's<00:03:02.459> not<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.609> huge<00:03:02.970> feature

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
grip so overall it's not a huge feature

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
need it and overall the sub pattern just

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.610 
need it and overall the sub pattern just
performs<00:04:12.209> really<00:04:12.449> really<00:04:12.750> well<00:04:12.930> that's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
performs really really well that's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.020 
performs really really well that's
pretty<00:04:13.859> much<00:04:13.949> it<00:04:14.099> as<00:04:14.250> far<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> unboxing

to a quick way and so you can see how

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.110 
to a quick way and so you can see how
light<00:04:18.599> these<00:04:18.810> guys<00:04:19.049> are<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:20.310> Mike<00:04:20.549> g3<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.090> a

of you looking for a shoe that it's
still<00:04:40.169> relatively<00:04:40.590> lightweight<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.520> still

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
still relatively lightweight but still

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.860 
still relatively lightweight but still
provide<00:04:42.000> some<00:04:42.180> pretty<00:04:42.330> decent<00:04:42.570> protection

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
provide some pretty decent protection

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290 
provide some pretty decent protection
the<00:04:43.650> Maestri<00:04:43.980> three<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.370> definitely<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.880> solid

the Maestri three is definitely a solid

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.270 
the Maestri three is definitely a solid
option<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.560> that's<00:04:46.650> pretty<00:04:46.830> much<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.100> as<00:04:47.250> far

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
option so that's pretty much it as far

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.680

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
far as sizing goes you have to be

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.860 
far as sizing goes you have to be
careful<00:05:23.310> with<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.490> ctr360<00:05:24.360> line<00:05:24.570> in<00:05:24.750> general

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
careful with the ctr360 line in general

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.020 
careful with the ctr360 line in general
because<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.979> only<00:05:26.190> line<00:05:26.520> from<00:05:26.729> Nike

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
because it is the only line from Nike

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.460 
because it is the only line from Nike
does<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.419> does<00:05:27.600> not<00:05:27.840> fit<00:05:28.139> true<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.380> size

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
does that it does not fit true to size

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.860 
does that it does not fit true to size
instead<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.520> worrying<00:05:29.700> my<00:05:29.820> usual<00:05:30.000> size<00:05:30.270> 9<00:05:30.540> us

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
instead of worrying my usual size 9 us

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.600 
instead of worrying my usual size 9 us
like<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.140> wouldn't<00:05:31.410> any<00:05:31.590> other<00:05:31.860> line<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.190> Nike

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610
