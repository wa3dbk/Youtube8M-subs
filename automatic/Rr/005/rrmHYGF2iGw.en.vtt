and I am bringing you another freaking
Theory<00:00:05.970> video<00:00:06.210> which<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.569> awesome<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.140> haven't

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
Theory video which is awesome I haven't

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.500 
Theory video which is awesome I haven't
done<00:00:07.470> one<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.799> couple<00:00:07.919> days<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.580> I've<00:00:09.360> had

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
done one in a couple days and I've had

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.850 
done one in a couple days and I've had
this<00:00:09.630> one<00:00:09.780> talked<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.139> wait<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.500> quite<00:00:10.679> some

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this one talked to wait for quite some

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.339 
this one talked to wait for quite some
time<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.370> decided<00:00:12.120> why<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:12.780> bring<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
time and decided why not bring it to you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.230 
time and decided why not bring it to you
guys<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:13.980> freaking<00:00:14.309> awesome<00:00:14.400> now

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
guys because it's freaking awesome now

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.439 
guys because it's freaking awesome now
my<00:00:15.630> theory<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.350> got<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.250> looking<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
my theory I got this from looking at the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.529 
my theory I got this from looking at the
bus<00:00:19.320> stops<00:00:19.619> map<00:00:20.100> now<00:00:20.699> we've<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.119> bus<00:00:21.330> route<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bus stops map now we've got bus route a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.060 
bus stops map now we've got bus route a
as<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.050> know<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:22.590> we've<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.830> bus

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
as we all know and then we've got bus

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.830 
as we all know and then we've got bus
route<00:00:23.279> B<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> people<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> been

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
route B which a lot of people have been

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
route B which a lot of people have been
trying<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.289> find<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.039> maybe<00:00:26.699> that's<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
trying to find and maybe that's like the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
trying to find and maybe that's like the
continuous<00:00:28.010> continuation<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
continuous continuation of the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
continuous continuation of the
easter-egg<00:00:29.519> itself<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.199> theory

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
easter-egg itself but you know my theory

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.190 
easter-egg itself but you know my theory
on<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> continuation<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.510> simple

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on the continuation is it's very simple

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
on the continuation is it's very simple
it<00:00:34.440> could<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.100> something<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
it could have something to do with the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389 
it could have something to do with the
fog<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.260> theory<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.590> call<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
fog now my theory I call it the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
fog now my theory I call it the
cleansing<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
cleansing and what that is is that the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.940 
cleansing and what that is is that the
fog<00:00:41.010> dissipates<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.710> well

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
fog dissipates from the not so well

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
fog dissipates from the not so well
known<00:00:44.250> areas<00:00:44.789> within<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> map<00:00:45.600> transit<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
known areas within the map transit and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.970 
known areas within the map transit and
the<00:00:47.129> fog<00:00:47.340> moves<00:00:47.700> over<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> other<00:00:49.559> areas

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the fog moves over to the other areas

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
the fog moves over to the other areas
such<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> diner<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.629> town<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.350> bus<00:00:52.530> stop

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
such as the diner the town the bus stop

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
such as the diner the town the bus stop
and<00:00:53.210> even<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> power<00:00:54.420> station<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.559> opens

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and even the power station which opens

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
and even the power station which opens
up<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.670> other<00:00:56.910> areas<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> leaves<00:00:57.960> them

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
up these other areas and leaves them

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.160 
up these other areas and leaves them
without<00:00:58.500> fog<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> um<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
without fog so that you can go to um and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
without fog so that you can go to um and
maybe<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.469> new<00:01:01.680> bus<00:01:02.129> route<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.670> know

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maybe the new bus route you know

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
maybe the new bus route you know
activates<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> bus<00:01:03.899> stops<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.350> these

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
activates and the bus stops at these

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
activates and the bus stops at these
locations<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.240> train

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
locations so that we can right train

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
locations so that we can right train
there<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:07.979> areas<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.610> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there you know these areas are really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
there you know these areas are really
wide<00:01:09.060> open<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.570> seems<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
wide open it seems like it would be a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
wide open it seems like it would be a
perfect<00:01:11.220> place<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> bus<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.939> stop<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
perfect place to the bus to stop you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
perfect place to the bus to stop you
know<00:01:12.570> pick<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:12.930> new<00:01:13.140> weapons<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
know pick up new weapons and all that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
know pick up new weapons and all that
good<00:01:14.070> stuff<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> first<00:01:15.270> location<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
good stuff so the first location that I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
good stuff so the first location that I
wanted<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> tell<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.070> cabin<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
wanted to tell you was the cabin in the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.719 
wanted to tell you was the cabin in the
woods<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.979> would<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> perfect

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
woods now this would be a perfect

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
woods now this would be a perfect
location<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.479> wide<00:01:21.689> open<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
location it's very wide open and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
location it's very wide open and
excellent<00:01:23.159> rate<00:01:23.280> trains<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.030> outside

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
excellent rate trains you can go outside

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
excellent rate trains you can go outside
the<00:01:24.390> house<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.990> good<00:01:25.140> stuff<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the house and all that good stuff and it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
the house and all that good stuff and it
seems<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> could<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> bus

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
seems like it could be you know a bus

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.499 
seems like it could be you know a bus
stop<00:01:28.110> itself<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.310> yeah<00:01:29.880> let's<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
stop itself but yeah let's go on to the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.130 
stop itself but yeah let's go on to the
next<00:01:30.869> location<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.310> bridge

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
next location which is the bridge

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
next location which is the bridge
alright<00:01:34.140> guys<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.560> onto<00:01:34.860> our<00:01:34.979> second<00:01:35.430> location

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
alright guys so onto our second location

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.330 
alright guys so onto our second location
that<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.240> been<00:01:36.420> cleansed<00:01:36.750> by<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> fog<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that has been cleansed by the fog is the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
that has been cleansed by the fog is the
bridge<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> bridge<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:40.110> after<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
bridge now the bridge is right after the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240 
bridge now the bridge is right after the
town<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.560> once<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.829> fog

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
town as we all know and once the fog

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
town as we all know and once the fog
dissipates<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> bridge<00:01:45.450> there's<00:01:45.869> no

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
dissipates from the bridge there's no

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
dissipates from the bridge there's no
more<00:01:46.170> denizens<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.670> on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
more denizens you can actually go on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
more denizens you can actually go on
there<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.119> take<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> bus<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.960> stops<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there and take the bus it stops on the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
there and take the bus it stops on the
bridge<00:01:50.070> possibly<00:01:50.820> cracks<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:51.630> doesn't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
bridge possibly cracks it or doesn't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
bridge possibly cracks it or doesn't
crack<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.560> um<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> couldn't<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.820> sure

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
crack it um you know I couldn't be sure

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.020 
crack it um you know I couldn't be sure
but<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.490> bus

giant rape trains and all that good

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.480 
giant rape trains and all that good
stuff

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
stuff

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
stuff
there<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.180> pros<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.509> some<00:02:03.810> cons<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
there are some pros and some cons to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.530 
there are some pros and some cons to
this<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.649> mean<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.369> pros<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this I mean the pros are that it is a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.809 
this I mean the pros are that it is a
pretty<00:02:07.170> big<00:02:07.439> location<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.399> people<00:02:08.429> can

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pretty big location for people can

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.420 
pretty big location for people can
actually<00:02:08.940> rape<00:02:09.270> train<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
actually rape train on this but the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.809 
actually rape train on this but the
other<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
other you know one is that

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.789 
other you know one is that
what<00:02:13.209> if<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.510> bridge<00:02:13.749> does<00:02:14.079> crack<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.620> mean

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
what if the bridge does crack I mean

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.069 
what if the bridge does crack I mean
you're<00:02:14.950> gonna<00:02:15.069> have<00:02:15.219> to<00:02:15.310> deal<00:02:15.519> with<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.079> the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
you're gonna have to deal with that the

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.959 
you're gonna have to deal with that the
theory<00:02:17.349> is<00:02:17.379> that<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.010> town<00:02:18.310> actually<00:02:18.609> gets

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
theory is that the town actually gets

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.849 
theory is that the town actually gets
covered<00:02:19.299> by<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.480> fog<00:02:19.780> instead<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.560> bridge

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
covered by the fog instead of the bridge

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.089 
covered by the fog instead of the bridge
so<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:22.510> gonna<00:02:22.659> be<00:02:22.810> tough<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.079> go<00:02:23.319> get<00:02:23.530> jog<00:02:23.799> or

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
so it's gonna be tough to go get jog or

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.589 
so it's gonna be tough to go get jog or
any<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.579> your<00:02:24.700> other<00:02:24.760> perks<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.269> are<00:02:25.389> there

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
any of your other perks that are there

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.199 
any of your other perks that are there
and<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.219> good<00:02:27.370> thing<00:02:27.519> too<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.730> mean<00:02:27.999> there

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
and it's a good thing too I mean there

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.000 
and it's a good thing too I mean there
are<00:02:28.329> no<00:02:28.480> guns<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.079> town<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.739> doesn't<00:02:29.950> really

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
are no guns in town so it doesn't really

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.629 
are no guns in town so it doesn't really
matter

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
matter

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.910 
matter
says<00:02:31.239> usually<00:02:31.900> everybody<00:02:32.109> has<00:02:32.379> guns<00:02:32.680> while

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
says usually everybody has guns while

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.039 
says usually everybody has guns while
they're<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.159> the<00:02:33.189> bus<00:02:33.340> anyways<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.420> yeah<00:02:34.870> guys

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
they're on the bus anyways but yeah guys

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.990 
they're on the bus anyways but yeah guys
this<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.260> our<00:02:35.379> second<00:02:35.739> location<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.370> let's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this is our second location and let's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.240 
this is our second location and let's
move<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.420> our<00:02:37.569> third<00:02:37.810> which<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.530> tunnel

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
move on to our third which is the tunnel

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.239 
move on to our third which is the tunnel
all<00:02:39.969> right<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:40.900> tunnel<00:02:41.409> is<00:02:41.560> perhaps<00:02:41.829> the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.249 
all right so the tunnel is perhaps the

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.000 
all right so the tunnel is perhaps the
largest<00:02:42.489> location<00:02:43.269> within<00:02:43.629> transit<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.439> mean

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
largest location within transit I mean

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.030 
largest location within transit I mean
it's<00:02:45.280> gigantic<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:46.030> goes<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.329> for<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.569> long<00:02:46.750> time

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it's gigantic it goes on for a long time

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.860 
it's gigantic it goes on for a long time
but<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.219> problem<00:02:48.549> is<00:02:48.700> only<00:02:48.969> a<00:02:49.150> portion<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
but the problem is only a portion of it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
but the problem is only a portion of it
is<00:02:49.989> playable<00:02:50.560> without<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> denizens<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.699> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
is playable without the denizens and the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.390 
is playable without the denizens and the
fog<00:02:52.000> now<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.930> portion<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.560> where<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.040> bus

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
fog now that portion is where the bus

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.429 
fog now that portion is where the bus
actually<00:02:54.939> slowly<00:02:55.239> moves<00:02:55.659> through<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.139> tunnel

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
actually slowly moves through the tunnel

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.830 
actually slowly moves through the tunnel
but<00:02:56.919> doesn't<00:02:56.980> actually<00:02:57.370> stop<00:02:57.819> there<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.659> an

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
but doesn't actually stop there is an

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.110 
but doesn't actually stop there is an
m16<00:02:59.379> there<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.799> can<00:03:00.069> use<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.939> I<00:03:00.969> was

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
m16 there that you can use so I was

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.149 
m16 there that you can use so I was
thinking<00:03:01.449> what<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.169> cleansing<00:03:02.560> gets<00:03:02.859> rid

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
thinking what if the cleansing gets rid

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.009 
thinking what if the cleansing gets rid
of<00:03:03.189> all<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.669> denizens<00:03:03.909> and<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.389> fog<00:03:04.599> within

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
of all the denizens and the fog within

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.099 
of all the denizens and the fog within
the<00:03:05.169> tunnel<00:03:05.500> itself<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:07.120> expands<00:03:07.750> making

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
the tunnel itself and it expands making

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.860 
the tunnel itself and it expands making
the<00:03:08.199> the<00:03:09.099> entirety<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.150> tunnel<00:03:10.449> playable

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
the the entirety of the tunnel playable

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.899 
the the entirety of the tunnel playable
I<00:03:11.109> would<00:03:11.769> love<00:03:11.889> to<00:03:11.980> see<00:03:12.129> that<00:03:12.280> they<00:03:12.459> even<00:03:12.609> said

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
I would love to see that they even said

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.819 
I would love to see that they even said
that<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.329> survival<00:03:14.139> map<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.439> going<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.680> take

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
that a survival map was going to take

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.740 
that a survival map was going to take
place<00:03:14.980> within<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.579> tunnel<00:03:15.879> but<00:03:16.510> they

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
place within the tunnel but they

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.749 
place within the tunnel but they
scrapped<00:03:17.259> that<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:18.009> idea<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.549> last

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759 
scrapped that the that idea at the last

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.520 
scrapped that the that idea at the last
minute<00:03:19.090> which<00:03:19.629> sucks<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.139> think<00:03:20.349> they<00:03:20.439> would

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
minute which sucks I think they would

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.439 
minute which sucks I think they would
have<00:03:20.620> been<00:03:20.709> perfect<00:03:21.159> I<00:03:21.280> mean<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:22.209> can<00:03:22.329> have

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
have been perfect I mean you can have

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.089 
have been perfect I mean you can have
epic<00:03:22.810> rape<00:03:23.019> trains<00:03:23.319> there<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.889> would<00:03:24.009> have

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
epic rape trains there it would have

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.699 
epic rape trains there it would have
been<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:24.459> much<00:03:24.519> fun<00:03:24.909> but<00:03:25.659> yeah<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.870> think<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
been so much fun but yeah I think that

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.770 
been so much fun but yeah I think that
the<00:03:27.220> fog<00:03:27.459> would<00:03:27.759> clear<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.329> there<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.599> bus

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
the fog would clear out of there the bus

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.449 
the fog would clear out of there the bus
actually<00:03:29.169> stops<00:03:29.470> there<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.829> can<00:03:29.949> get<00:03:30.129> on<00:03:30.280> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
actually stops there you can get on it

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.580 
actually stops there you can get on it
if<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:30.699> want<00:03:30.939> to<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.239> can<00:03:31.419> get<00:03:31.599> off<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.989> stay

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
if you want to you can get off it stay

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
if you want to you can get off it stay
in<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.739> tunnel<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.099> doesn't<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.370> matter

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
in the tunnel it doesn't really matter

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.170 
in the tunnel it doesn't really matter
our<00:03:34.810> next<00:03:35.379> location<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.129> our<00:03:36.220> final<00:03:36.549> stop<00:03:36.879> on

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
our next location and our final stop on

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.710 
our next location and our final stop on
bus<00:03:37.629> route<00:03:37.870> B<00:03:38.109> would<00:03:38.919> have<00:03:39.189> to<00:03:39.430> be<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:40.060> fields

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
bus route B would have to be the fields

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.599 
bus route B would have to be the fields
along<00:03:41.019> with<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.259> obelisk<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.949> not<00:03:42.280> Stearns

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
along with the obelisk and not Stearns

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.270 
along with the obelisk and not Stearns
Houghton<00:03:42.939> now<00:03:43.629> this<00:03:44.169> would<00:03:44.409> be<00:03:44.560> epic<00:03:44.949> as<00:03:45.069> well

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
Houghton now this would be epic as well

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.679 
Houghton now this would be epic as well
I<00:03:45.579> mean<00:03:45.759> they<00:03:45.909> even<00:03:45.939> said<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.540> they<00:03:46.629> were

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
I mean they even said that they were

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.360 
I mean they even said that they were
gonna<00:03:46.810> make<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.169> a<00:03:47.229> survival<00:03:47.829> map<00:03:47.979> as<00:03:48.159> well

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
gonna make this a survival map as well

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.509 
gonna make this a survival map as well
but<00:03:49.180> they<00:03:49.599> scrapped<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.079> for<00:03:50.979> some<00:03:51.129> apparent

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
but they scrapped it for some apparent

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.339 
but they scrapped it for some apparent
reason<00:03:51.939> I<00:03:52.060> have<00:03:52.209> no<00:03:52.419> idea<00:03:52.720> why<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.019> would<00:03:53.259> have

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
reason I have no idea why it would have

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.740 
reason I have no idea why it would have
been<00:03:53.439> perfect<00:03:53.919> but<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:55.030> bus<00:03:55.180> stop<00:03:55.359> stops

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
been perfect but the bus stop stops

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.890 
been perfect but the bus stop stops
there<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.829> mean<00:03:57.759> it<00:03:57.879> clearly<00:03:58.000> looks<00:03:58.479> like<00:03:58.659> there

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
there I mean it clearly looks like there

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.569 
there I mean it clearly looks like there
is<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> spot<00:03:59.590> where<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.889> bus<00:04:00.040> would<00:04:00.250> actually

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
is a spot where the bus would actually

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.939 
is a spot where the bus would actually
stop<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.150> then<00:04:01.719> you<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.079> off<00:04:02.229> go<00:04:02.650> inside

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
stop and then you can get off go inside

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.429 
stop and then you can get off go inside
the<00:04:03.009> fields<00:04:03.579> do<00:04:04.180> some<00:04:04.419> epic<00:04:04.689> rape<00:04:04.840> trains<00:04:05.169> go

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
the fields do some epic rape trains go

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.229 
the fields do some epic rape trains go
around<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.859> fields<00:04:06.400> go<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.669> nuts<00:04:06.939> through<00:04:07.150> at

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
around the fields go to nuts through at

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.629 
around the fields go to nuts through at
oten<00:04:07.659> and<00:04:07.810> even<00:04:08.139> go<00:04:08.259> to<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.500> obelisk<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:09.159> would

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
oten and even go to the obelisk I would

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.399 
oten and even go to the obelisk I would
love<00:04:09.789> to<00:04:09.909> play<00:04:10.000> there<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.479> maybe<00:04:10.810> even<00:04:11.049> some

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
love to play there and maybe even some

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.249 
love to play there and maybe even some
secret<00:04:11.889> guns<00:04:12.129> pop<00:04:12.489> up<00:04:12.759> but<00:04:13.419> yeah<00:04:13.810> guys<00:04:13.959> that's

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259 
secret guns pop up but yeah guys that's

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.959 
secret guns pop up but yeah guys that's
my<00:04:14.409> theory<00:04:14.799> for<00:04:15.189> the<00:04:15.280> cleansing<00:04:15.669> there<00:04:15.879> are

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:15.969 
my theory for the cleansing there are

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.789 
my theory for the cleansing there are
four<00:04:16.239> stops<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.840> cabin<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.289> wood<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
four stops the cabin in the wood the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.649 
four stops the cabin in the wood the
tunnel<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.930> bridge<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.609> fields<00:04:22.180> now

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
tunnel the bridge and the fields now

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.420 
tunnel the bridge and the fields now
those<00:04:22.840> four<00:04:23.080> locations<00:04:23.199> would<00:04:23.770> make<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.010> bus

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
those four locations would make a bus

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
those four locations would make a bus
route<00:04:24.639> be

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
route be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.000 
route be
and<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.750> would<00:04:25.840> be<00:04:25.960> cool<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.200> see<00:04:26.350> all<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.800> fog

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
and it would be cool to see all the fog

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.600 
and it would be cool to see all the fog
move<00:04:27.340> over<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.910> other<00:04:28.060> locations<00:04:28.750> and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
move over to the other locations and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.430 
move over to the other locations and
give<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.730> bus<00:04:30.970> Rafi<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.020> would<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.140> cool

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
give you bus Rafi now it would be cool

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.410 
give you bus Rafi now it would be cool
if<00:04:32.470> there<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.010> some<00:04:33.250> way<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.880> can<00:04:34.120> switch

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
if there is some way that we can switch

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.240 
if there is some way that we can switch
these<00:04:34.630> on<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.110> off<00:04:35.170> sort<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.830> switching

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
these on and off sort of like switching

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.430 
these on and off sort of like switching
out<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.430> power<00:04:36.640> but<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:37.870> know<00:04:37.990> that's<00:04:38.290> just

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
out the power but you know that's just

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.080 
out the power but you know that's just
the<00:04:38.590> theory<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.980> my<00:04:39.130> guys<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.700> if<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:39.940> guys

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
the theory of my guys and if you guys

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.700 
the theory of my guys and if you guys
like<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.630> please<00:04:40.990> leave<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.200> comment<00:04:41.410> tell<00:04:41.680> me
