00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 yes 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.890
 hi friends from youtube I'm diego fj ya 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.020
 I had time that I did not make a video but 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.150
 I have my reasons a long time ago 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.550
 I wanted to see the anime of dead not but 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.830
 I had never been able to so these days 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.080
 I started to see it I saw it complete and I wanted to 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.790
 make a video about my opinion a 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.650
 criticism at the end and some other 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.440
 things about the series that I do not 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.780
 they seemed good everyone knows who is the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 main character of this series light 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680
 Yagami is a student who is 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.809
 a notebook with which you can kill 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.030
 people with just write their name 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.400
 said notebook with the name of letting us 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350
 guide me believe that justice is to kill 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.989
 to all the criminals and thus create a 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 new world and blah blah blah good in 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
 my opinion the anime should not end 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.440
 well like it should not die since partly 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600
 he was right and the world was 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.150
 changing thanks to him committing the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.250
 murders of bad people making themselves 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.409
 pass as kira at the beginning he alone 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.330
 killed bad people but agree 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.430
 advanced the series what many do not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.320
 put to think is that those who were in 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.689
 against him he was led to kill 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.970
 innocent people or those who were 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.680
 against him when he saw himself running 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.330
 killed him whoever got in his 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.000
 I think that if nobody had 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.640
 intervened in his tyrant mission would have 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.740
 murdered only criminals and that was 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.260
 what happened to him he opposed that no longer 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.120
 had another option as people say is 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.430
 kill or die and he to achieve his 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.250
 ideals murdered those who were in their 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.260
 I walk like him and others and I know that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.080
 they will say that the series would not have a joke like that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.030
 but everyone thinks what they want and 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.310
 for me the notebook was doing more and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.979
 more malignant to like to the point of thinking about 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.680
 only he and not in his family was a final 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.810
 sad for some and good for others and 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.820
 the session or him but not for me l 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 He died in the anime because when I did it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 is dead on the stairs you see that l 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.820
 he is observing that for me it is proof 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.640
 he did not die and went to witness his 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.380
 death as a gesture of victory that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200
 yes he should die for me is to deny 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.360
 xd also that I did not like too much that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.910
 will change to near but for me everything 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.980
 that was a plan of him to put a successor 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
 his to defeat and discover who was 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.690
 what it was really like and that's how it happened 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 he beat kira although there is another end 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.640
 alternative in which he wins and I know how 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.190
 in a shinigami and I think that must have been the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.019
 correct ending that ignores her dead but 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 neither that if it takes in the world of 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.650
 human beings and that everything returns to the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 good normality I know that you 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.909
 will have their own conclusions of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.010
 who would like to have died or not 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.530
 would have appeared in the series or from what 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.930
 side are I for one am of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.120
 side of him although I said that like he should not 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 die but I would have liked him not to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 would have stopped coming out in the series or 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.540
 less not so fast as it is now 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.910
 They know how I would have liked it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.670
 will end of arnold in my opinion and in 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.829
 summary that like I would not have died but 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.750
 that did not continue in the human world that l 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.910
 he faked his death and that near 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.450
 killed by light before leaving 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.489
 good friends of youtube I am diego fj you 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.980
 I give a 10 to leave not since it left me 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.319
 satisfied and is unanimous that I would recommend 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.780
 without hesitation without further ado 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.780
 soon I will make more videos until next time 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.940
 and
