and what you can do is in a pan this
size<00:01:02.329> you<00:01:02.690> probably<00:01:03.079> three<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:03.530> be<00:01:03.680> more

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
size you probably three would be more

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140 
than ample most of this has developed

from the big stately homes where they

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.330 
from the big stately homes where they
plant<00:01:08.420> thousands<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.050> these<00:01:09.140> things<00:01:09.470> push

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
plant thousands of these things push

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.280 
plant thousands of these things push
that<00:01:10.520> down<00:01:10.729> into<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.180> bed<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.510> compost<00:01:12.020> just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
that down into a bed of compost just

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.170 
that down into a bed of compost just
three<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.190> those<00:01:14.860> place<00:01:15.860> down<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.370> you<00:01:17.000> can

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
three of those place down and you can

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.240 
three of those place down and you can
actually<00:01:17.570> see<00:01:17.810> them<00:01:18.049> swell<00:01:18.380> up<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.799> grow<00:01:19.040> and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
actually see them swell up and grow and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.770 
actually see them swell up and grow and
they<00:01:19.340> look<00:01:19.520> like<00:01:19.670> come<00:01:19.970> out<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> sensor

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
they look like come out of the sensor

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.719 
they look like come out of the sensor
and<00:01:20.930> they'll<00:01:21.650> grow<00:01:21.860> on<00:01:22.010> and<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.370> put<00:01:22.549> some

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
and they'll grow on and you put some

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.310 
and they'll grow on and you put some
more<00:01:22.880> compost<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.450> top<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.080> was<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
more compost on top that was the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.960 
more compost on top that was the
old-fashioned<00:01:24.799> way<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:24.950> doing<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
old-fashioned way of doing it now the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.510 
old-fashioned way of doing it now the
modern<00:01:26.299> way<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.470> do<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.710> exactly<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.310> same

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
modern way is you do it exactly the same

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.640 
modern way is you do it exactly the same
as<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.909> only<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:29.659> put<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.900> layer<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.320> compost

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
as that only you put a layer of compost

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.039 
as that only you put a layer of compost
on<00:01:30.890> top<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:32.090> like<00:01:32.180> you're<00:01:32.420> putting<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.810> plant

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
on top just like you're putting a plant

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.640 
on top just like you're putting a plant
in<00:01:33.260> or<00:01:33.440> planting<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.979> bulb<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.310> any<00:01:34.460> sort<00:01:35.650> you

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
in or planting a bulb of any sort you

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.550 
in or planting a bulb of any sort you
put<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> layer<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.159> compost<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.000> top<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:39.260> it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
put a layer of compost on the top and it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.500 
put a layer of compost on the top and it
really<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.400> easy<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.240> wait

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
really is as easy as that and you wait

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.750 
really is as easy as that and you wait
