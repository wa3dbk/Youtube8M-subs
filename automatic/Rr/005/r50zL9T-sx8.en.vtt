getting<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.439> iphone<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> very

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
getting your iphone into this is a very

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
getting your iphone into this is a very
simple<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.659> back

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
simple we're just going to put the back

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.920 
simple we're just going to put the back
in<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:26.330> fold<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.630> top<00:01:28.220> that's<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.930> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
in and fold this on top that's it and so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.890 
in and fold this on top that's it and so
again<00:01:31.490> if<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.700> take<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.630> more

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
again if we take a look at it it's more

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
again if we take a look at it it's more
of<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.549> slippery<00:01:35.549> feel<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.710> solid

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of a slippery feel then you know a solid

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
of a slippery feel then you know a solid
grip<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> nature<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
grip then that's just the nature of the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
grip then that's just the nature of the
plastic<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.729> again<00:01:41.939> we're<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.390> with

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
plastic so again we're going to do with

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
plastic so again we're going to do with
360<00:01:43.229> view<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
360 view here so you can see what it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
360 view here so you can see what it
looks<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> speakers<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
looks like so again the speakers are

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
looks like so again the speakers are
going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> open<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.399> looking<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
going to be open and then looking at it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480 
going to be open and then looking at it
from<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> back<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.689> still<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.159> view<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
from the back you still have the view of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.600 
from the back you still have the view of
the<00:01:56.520> nice<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.390> glass<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.610> it's

the nice you know glass back and it's
not<00:01:59.759> protruding<00:02:00.240> whatsoever<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.380> still

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
not protruding whatsoever so you still

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
not protruding whatsoever so you still
have<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> full<00:02:02.430> camera<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> full

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
flash obviously and looking at it from

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.880 
flash obviously and looking at it from
the<00:02:06.299> front<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.179> looks<00:02:09.360> like

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the front that's what it looks like

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.570 
the front that's what it looks like
so<00:02:11.009> again<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> green<00:02:12.630> bumper<00:02:13.350> and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
so again this is the green bumper and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.940 
so again this is the green bumper and
quickly<00:02:14.580> before<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:15.120> conclude<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.810> video<00:02:16.200> we

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
quickly before we conclude this video we

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.840 
quickly before we conclude this video we
are<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.910> show<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
are going to show you you know what the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.990 
are going to show you you know what the
antenna<00:02:21.420> issue<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.590> how<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> bumper

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
antenna issue is like and how the bumper

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.740 
antenna issue is like and how the bumper
can<00:02:24.180> actually<00:02:24.569> prevent<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.590> issue<00:02:26.750> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
can actually prevent this issue so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.560 
can actually prevent this issue so
looking<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.880> let's<00:02:29.880> bring<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
looking here let's bring this up a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.199 
looking here let's bring this up a
little<00:02:30.660> bit<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.200> full<00:02:31.530> bars<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:32.130> AT&amp;T<00:02:32.850> s

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
little bit we have full bars on AT&amp;T s

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.309 
little bit we have full bars on AT&amp;T s
3g<00:02:33.840> network<00:02:34.970> however<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.640> pull<00:02:39.570> my<00:02:39.810> hands

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
3g network however if I pull my hands

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.410 
3g network however if I pull my hands
over<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.800> antenna<00:02:41.190> you'll<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
over the antenna you'll see that the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.890 
over the antenna you'll see that the
signals<00:02:42.840> now<00:02:43.020> dropped<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:44.430> bar<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.720> it's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
signals now dropped one bar and now it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.140 
signals now dropped one bar and now it's
dropped<00:02:46.140> two<00:02:46.350> bars<00:02:46.620> we're<00:02:47.430> down<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.910> three

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
dropped two bars we're down to three

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.509 
dropped two bars we're down to three
bars<00:02:48.870> dropped<00:02:49.230> another<00:02:49.500> bar<00:02:49.739> down<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:49.980> two

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
bars dropped another bar down to two

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.050 
bars dropped another bar down to two
bars<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.720> were<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:54.989> two<00:02:55.350> bars<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.550> I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
bars and so we were at two bars and I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.570 
bars and so we were at two bars and I
don't<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:57.840> that's<00:02:57.989> going<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.170> go<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.590> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
don't think that's going to go to one so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.370 
don't think that's going to go to one so
we've<00:02:59.730> dropped<00:02:59.940> three<00:03:00.300> bars<00:03:00.570> since<00:03:01.110> we've

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
we've dropped three bars since we've

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.110 
we've dropped three bars since we've
done<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.650> now<00:03:03.380> we<00:03:04.380> are<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.160> place<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
done that now we are going to place the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:16.640 
done that now we are going to place the
phone<00:03:07.130> into<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.160> insulated<00:03:08.820> bumper<00:03:09.120> case<00:03:15.650> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
phone into the insulated bumper case so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740 
phone into the insulated bumper case so
let's<00:03:16.860> let<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.370> device<00:03:17.850> recoup<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.540> little

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
let's let the device recoup a little

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.990 
let's let the device recoup a little
game<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.470> its<00:03:19.709> full<00:03:20.070> service<00:03:20.940> bars<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.850> now

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
game back its full service bars so now

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.580 
game back its full service bars so now
we're<00:03:24.150> at<00:03:24.209> full<00:03:24.390> bars<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:24.930> try<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.260> test

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
we're at full bars we can try this test

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:36.199 
we're at full bars we can try this test
again<00:03:27.049> now<00:03:28.049> hold<00:03:28.380> as<00:03:28.530> hard<00:03:28.739> as<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:28.920> can<00:03:35.209> nothing

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
again now hold as hard as I can nothing

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.630 
again now hold as hard as I can nothing
so<00:03:36.930> you'll<00:03:37.079> see<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> bumper<00:03:38.280> actually

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
so you'll see that the bumper actually

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.020 
so you'll see that the bumper actually
does<00:03:38.880> prevent<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.170> antenna<00:03:40.650> issue<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.430> few

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
does prevent the antenna issue and a few

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.210 
does prevent the antenna issue and a few
