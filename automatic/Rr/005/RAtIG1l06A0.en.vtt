 hello everyone with you just take and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.849
 today I will show my mechanical 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.969
 mancraft robot 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:17.760
 I built it myself on version 1 7 2 and 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:23.039
 let's go to his cabin all the time 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:28.769
 pressure plate on the year these things later 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.669
 still had to remove the race on just and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 higher welcome my cabin and 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.610
 let's be the first and not meaningful clear 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 our 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.670
 and the mentor is so cleared 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:51.600
 how can you turn on or 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:53.850
 turn off the lights and so supposes there are those 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.480
 guns both in the right and in the left 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.480
 hand let me hand Ustin merged their arrows 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:14.930
 well, they will start a fireball because 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.930
 what else will be a fire there and and 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:28.130
 let's turn on the night and the keys are backlit 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:32.640
 wait but it is very much to take all 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:37.229
 go out and then he excluded from 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.979
 landing only some of us do not shine 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 and I can not fix it because 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:51.649
 your otherwise will not work and not also 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.439
 on this map if you can download 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:59.090
 go by the name of the mechanical house like 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.220
 we can first get out of the cab 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:18.520
 let's turn on the day and 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:21.700
 turn off the backlight you can also click on 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.160
 a button and the back of the work will appear 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.280
 these are fine but I won't do it 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.760
 then if you download look there 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:38.440
 nothing just water from distributors 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.750
 flows out and let's go mini 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:50.590
 mechanical to us so first yet 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:55.810
 I shoot and we shoot and all 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 let's go mechanical home here then 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.690
 you can turn on day and night and also have 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.030
 and the rink was boiling not very cool and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:16.060
 let's go here not so much 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:19.320
 cool battle here live here 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 there is no paper that you are a movie 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:30.970
 also turn on the cool for you too 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:35.170
 such act and the next room 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.040
 this message is nothing mechanical 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.950
 type of computer shelf collisions and 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.269
 open the next room is the kitchen 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.760
 there's nothing here cinema and here is darkness 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.410
 especially so it was difficult to notice 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.410
 It s not so difficult 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:04.730
 not like the video was sure 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:07.180
 an hour I speak here a fireplace of this type is necessary 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.689
 fill with rights 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:20.979
 almost nothing mechanical and let's 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:20.979
 get out and close the last room 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:30.310
 This we we we we refuse 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:36.889
 room and here we just go here 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:47.470
 get down and here is such a mini bar here 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:56.720
 there is a mechanism bartender you then I tell you 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:05:00.289
 how to do it there will be a link for moms 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:07.160
 I did not know myself and let's see 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:10.460
 let's go our robot if we get over 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:19.010
 this pressure plate us so pasha it to 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:22.550
 dinner we are the last arrangements it is very 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:26.630
 cool and my favorite if we leave on 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.270
 pressure plate and here it is difficult then we 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:41.090
 he shoots 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:44.120
 like a laser and well and that's all for it 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:51.010
 if you like this robot put 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.010
 Like download the map and comment 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.010
 signed channel light of friends and 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.810
 please I asked you to put 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.160
 please like this is my first such 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.890
 what strong mechanisms 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.870
 I will release more videos later 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:15.560
 very very what mechanisms and on this 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.560
 until
