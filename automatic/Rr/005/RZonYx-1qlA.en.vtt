00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
size of the badniks that works in the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.220 
size of the badniks that works in the
generation<00:00:29.220> designs<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> beanie

points so I had to cut the abdomen off
for<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> point<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.480> reasons<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.110> become

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
for a point for reasons that will become

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.670 
for a point for reasons that will become
apparent<00:00:46.440> later<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.360> removed<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.230> legs

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
little pipes from model airplanes to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.729 
little pipes from model airplanes to
make<00:00:59.840> things<00:01:00.840> which<00:01:01.829> you'll<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> moment

into a little hole that was just
naturally<00:02:10.650> there<00:02:10.860> since<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.460> finger

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
naturally there since it's a finger

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.120 
naturally there since it's a finger
puppet<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:13.170> section<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.920> all

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
puppet and that this section is all

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.250 
puppet and that this section is all
Hollow<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.820> stuff<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:15.990> pretty<00:02:16.140> much

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
Hollow and stuff and then I pretty much

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.930 
Hollow and stuff and then I pretty much
filled<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.680> hot<00:02:17.070> glue<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
filled it with hot glue so that it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
filled it with hot glue so that it
wouldn't<00:02:18.210> wiggle<00:02:18.330> around<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.890> course

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
wouldn't wiggle around of course

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.650 
wouldn't wiggle around of course
although<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.940> looked<00:02:21.150> about<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.420> right

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
although it looked about the right

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.920 
although it looked about the right
length<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.320> was<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.220> normal<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
length when it was you know normal the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.380 
length when it was you know normal the
extra<00:02:25.440> length<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.610> new<00:02:26.850> waist<00:02:27.120> joint

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
extra length that this new waist joint

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.860 
extra length that this new waist joint
added<00:02:27.840> meant<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.860> end<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> bit<00:02:30.510> too

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
added meant that the end was a bit too

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.620 
added meant that the end was a bit too
long<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.190> looked<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.490> waspish<00:02:33.270> than

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
long so it looked more waspish than

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.230 
long so it looked more waspish than
bumblebee<00:02:34.260> ish<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240

well anyway as you can see thanks to the
waist<00:03:25.050> articulation<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.890> gave<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.490> can

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
waist articulation I gave it it can

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.390 
waist articulation I gave it it can
assume<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.420> flight<00:03:27.810> pose<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.530> curl<00:03:29.160> its

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
assume the flight pose and curl its

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120 
assume the flight pose and curl its
abdomen<00:03:29.850> more<00:03:30.270> than<00:03:30.480> 90<00:03:30.840> degrees<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
abdomen more than 90 degrees down so it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.950 
abdomen more than 90 degrees down so it
can<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.400> into<00:03:32.610> firing<00:03:32.850> position<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.810> like

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
can get into firing position just like

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.670 
can get into firing position just like
in<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.200> videogame

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
