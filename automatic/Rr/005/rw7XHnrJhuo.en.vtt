00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
focused in one area because it does get

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.649 
it doesn't have to be really pretty or
perfect<00:01:43.100> because<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.700> can<00:01:43.880> clean<00:01:44.179> it<00:01:44.299> up<00:01:44.479> in

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
perfect because we can clean it up in

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.480 
perfect because we can clean it up in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.059 
kind of like a salt shaker but the holes
are<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.609> lot<00:01:58.789> thicker<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.600> does<00:02:00.020> get<00:02:00.259> clogged<00:02:00.799> up

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
are a lot thicker it does get clogged up

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.980 
are a lot thicker it does get clogged up
so<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.609> you<00:02:01.759> see<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.329> just<00:02:02.420> tipped<00:02:02.899> it

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
so like you see here I just tipped it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.929 
so like you see here I just tipped it
over<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.590> then<00:02:03.709> try<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.009> again<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.700> just

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
over and then try it again and it just

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.330 
over and then try it again and it just
came<00:02:05.360> out<00:02:05.569> perfectly<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.130> want<00:02:07.280> to

all<00:02:33.170> our<00:02:33.379> nails<00:02:33.620> doing<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.280> at<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.610> time

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
all our nails doing one at a time

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.809 
all our nails doing one at a time
because<00:02:35.239> if<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.379> jump<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.859> gun<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.160> paint

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
felt on it's not gonna stick as well

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.759 
felt on it's not gonna stick as well
because<00:02:40.910> they're<00:02:41.030> not<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.359> be<00:02:41.769> fresh

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
you do this one at a time and set it

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.979

of 30 minutes for the nails to dry

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.140 
of 30 minutes for the nails to dry
