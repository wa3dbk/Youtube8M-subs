I wanted your guy's opinion on something

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.980 
I wanted your guy's opinion on something
you<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> bottom<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.360> where<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you know the bottom here where the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
you know the bottom here where the
obsidian<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.649> um<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.270> know<00:02:03.390> ways<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> fill

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
obsidian is um I don't know ways to fill

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
obsidian is um I don't know ways to fill
that<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.170> lava<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:04.979> super<00:02:05.549> MLG

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that with lava so it's like super MLG

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.150 
that with lava so it's like super MLG
like<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> only<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.320> survive<00:02:07.890> if

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
like the only way they can survive if

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.070 
like the only way they can survive if
they<00:02:08.280> fall<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.759> by<00:02:08.940> landing<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> iron<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
they fall is by landing on the iron I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.690 
they fall is by landing on the iron I
think<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.530> might<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:10.979> cool<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
think that might be pretty cool but I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.760 
think that might be pretty cool but I
don't<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> think<00:02:13.410> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
don't know but what do you think that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
don't know but what do you think that
no<00:02:14.240> but<00:02:15.240> yes<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> inside<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
no but yes so this is the inside of the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.310 
no but yes so this is the inside of the
arena<00:02:16.800> we've<00:02:17.310> done<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> few<00:02:18.270> more<00:02:18.660> bits<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.170> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
arena we've done a few more bits to it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.590 
arena we've done a few more bits to it
since<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.680> last<00:02:19.980> saw<00:02:20.130> her<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.400> guess<00:02:20.700> apologies

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
since you last saw her I guess apologies

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.270 
since you last saw her I guess apologies
for<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> lag<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.320> probably<00:02:22.710> shouldn't<00:02:23.190> be

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
for the lag I probably shouldn't be

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.620 
for the lag I probably shouldn't be

with<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> lava<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:39.660> server<00:02:39.930> has<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
with the lava and this server has a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.410 
with the lava and this server has a
really<00:02:40.470> cool<00:02:40.680> function<00:02:41.130> where<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.180> lava

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
really cool function where the lava

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.810 
really cool function where the lava
doesn't<00:02:42.780> flow<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.710> prevent<00:02:44.070> fire<00:02:44.460> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
doesn't flow is to prevent fire and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.660 
doesn't flow is to prevent fire and
griefing<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.540> all<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:47.280> means<00:02:47.520> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
griefing and all of that which means you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670 
griefing and all of that which means you
