00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
something I did want to mention I really

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.140 
something I did want to mention I really
do<00:02:45.319> like<00:02:45.680> things<00:02:46.040> nice<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.549> smooth<00:02:46.849> and

do like things nice and smooth and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.970 
do like things nice and smooth and
liquify<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:47.810> why<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:47.989> did<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.409> whole<00:02:48.650> juice

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
liquify that's why I did the whole juice

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.339 
liquify that's why I did the whole juice
button<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.389> wanted<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.840> push<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.930 
button if you wanted to push the
smoothie<00:02:51.769> button<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.819> have<00:02:52.909> a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
smoothie button so you just have a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.149 
smoothie button so you just have a
little<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:53.269> more<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.590> chunkiness

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
little bit more of the the chunkiness

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.770 
little bit more of the the chunkiness
and<00:02:55.549> there<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.970> can<00:02:56.120> do<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.629> well

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and there you can do that as well

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.089 
and there you can do that as well
because<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:57.260> mark<00:02:57.620> took<00:02:57.769> probably

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
because I think mark took probably

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.089 
because I think mark took probably
wanted<00:02:58.670> something<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> little<00:02:59.480> bit<00:02:59.629> more

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
wanted something with a little bit more

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.009 
wanted something with a little bit more
substance<00:03:01.099> but<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.030> prefer<00:03:02.569> stuff<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> little

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
substance but I prefer stuff a little

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.780 
substance but I prefer stuff a little
bit<00:03:03.109> smoother<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.159> kind<00:03:04.670> of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
bit smoother and that really is kind of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.920 
bit smoother and that really is kind of
the<00:03:04.849> neat<00:03:05.030> thing<00:03:05.209> about<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.720> so

another<00:03:35.120> three<00:03:36.120> thousand-plus<00:03:36.690> uses<00:03:37.410> because

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
another three thousand-plus uses because

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.869 
another three thousand-plus uses because
yeah<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:40.379> did<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> math<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.640> think

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
yeah it's a we did the math and I think

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.990 
yeah it's a we did the math and I think
we<00:03:42.000> averaged<00:03:42.420> at<00:03:42.599> least<00:03:42.810> three<00:03:43.290> uses<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.739> day

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
we averaged at least three uses a day

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.220 
we averaged at least three uses a day
which<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.150> fantastic<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:45.930> probably<00:03:46.170> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
which is fantastic so it's probably the
