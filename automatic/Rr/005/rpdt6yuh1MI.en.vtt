00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 his hammer will have to have you never 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 desired to own a top club 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 after spending months and months at the club 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.710
 with more or less the same routine members 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 native and selfish who do nothing else 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.849
 who ask for a dragon for their c15 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 spaces in the castle of the clan 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 maybe I should start creating your first one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 club to make everything better now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 I will give you some suggestions that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 they will help you to do so call yours 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.469
 club the dragons 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 ok maybe they want claro and that i should then 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.809
 choose the emblem that helps your 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.690
 friend or someone to find clan e 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 therefore being able to enter is important that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 imposed the unique or better name 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.960
 that is not common in the community of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 game 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 in fact if a clan name comes to mind 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.829
 company clan mandate then entered the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.159
 name and see if there are other clubs with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.570
 the same name because I tell you this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.400
 and I say this mainly because if 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 you want to make a candy success that comes 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 cup recognized over time 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 it is better to avoid existing new ones or 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.350
 especially so as not to cause hitches 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 inviting your friend or 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.510
 acquaintance to enter nissan though 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 supercell has introduced advanced methods 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.790
 search clan but we can anyway 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.570
 avoid wasting time too 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 if it 's a minute or two but not 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.259
 pause and much about this on 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 this last point because the thing more 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 important to always be used originals 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.330
 at best your imagination vi 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.170
 therefore I do not recommend the major names 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.630
 partial used as dark clash carvings 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.180
 in Italy strong unspeakable et cetera 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 etc 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.509
 so dear a solid and consistent clan 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.789
 never need some members and therefore 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.190
 it's up to you to start creating canada 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.930
 free access for all if it is not yet 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.570
 do it I can already find members 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.440
 with the experience of the game do not put 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.769
 more than a thousand and one trophies 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.330
 otherwise you will not find so many non members 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.340
 forget about the description of the clan 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 to give an idea what your a is pointing to 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.650
 cannes that you are fun is 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.989
 push trophies or other 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
 the memories you will also have what you expect 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.950
 by supercell members also has 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.959
 extended the maximum characters from 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.540
 description then try to write 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.750
 all you need for example of 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.750
 brain tumor 4 or minimum level 5 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.100
 good players do not enter 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.560
 accidentally in your club 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.400
 maybe you find one lucky maybe two 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.830
 but it must actively recruit the global 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.080
 a good idea to replicate and that's it 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.180
 in short, almost more obvious but not always 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.610
 simple many times people 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.970
 not even the tires your request i 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.980
 global members of us were heard to write 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.170
 in addition to the classic he recruited members 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.330
 something more detailed in ad 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.750
 example we look for members with troops ai 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.180
 true 5 active or maybe cheering we try 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 members with barbarians we see level 4 and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 arches minimum level 4 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.600
 at the beginning while he was recruiting two 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.380
 seems to be giving troops to give the impression 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.300
 that key nuclei members therefore active 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.850
 moreover not offering everyone launched is 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.160
 that you want the members of the clan to be 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.250
 loyal and willing to help by giving it 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.210
 then a great merit given their good 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.040
 way beyond this, talk to them 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.380
 almost detail the just cause for 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.970
 stay in your field the alerts there 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.220
 when the average of the troops received 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.070
 donate both negative so they can 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.880
 recover to make your club one 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.380
 history 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.300
 do what was missing in the clan where you are 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.660
 was previously before 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.500
 then decide to understand your club 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 this in fact to what really 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.260
 it matters 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.489
 and for today it's all taken of everything 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.489
 attention hello to all guys
