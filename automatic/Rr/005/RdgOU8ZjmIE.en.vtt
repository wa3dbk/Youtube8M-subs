00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
sure what the rules are as far as you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
sure what the rules are as far as you
know<00:01:08.040> charging<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.640> using<00:01:08.880> flurry<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.720> had<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
know charging and using flurry but had I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
know charging and using flurry but had I
known<00:01:10.650> whether<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.430> could<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.820> charge

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
known whether or not I could use charge

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
known whether or not I could use charge
and<00:01:12.270> flurry<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:13.560> would<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.950> taken

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and flurry I probably would have taken

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.310 
and flurry I probably would have taken
Galactus<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> Superman<00:01:18.570> figure

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
has George flurry and super strength so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.640 
has George flurry and super strength so
basically<00:01:29.509> before<00:01:30.509> damn<00:01:30.780> introducing<00:01:31.350> powers

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
basically before damn introducing powers

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.240 
basically before damn introducing powers
take<00:01:31.860> place<00:01:32.810> he<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> deal<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> 14<00:01:34.799> damage

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

whatever<00:02:36.300> featured<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:38.930> my<00:02:39.930> other<00:02:40.080> team

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
whatever featured like my other team

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.370 
whatever featured like my other team
here<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.180> thought<00:02:42.180> was<00:02:42.570> very<00:02:42.720> useful<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
here I thought was very useful on the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.860 
here I thought was very useful on the
Arkham<00:02:44.190> Asylum<00:02:44.459> map<00:02:44.880> because<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.630> Arkham

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
Arkham Asylum map because the Arkham

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.860 
Arkham Asylum map because the Arkham
Asylum<00:02:46.080> map<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.680> garbage<00:02:47.519> when<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.390> comes<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
Asylum map is garbage when it comes to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.500 
Asylum map is garbage when it comes to
entering<00:02:49.260> terrain<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> did<00:02:51.090> was<00:02:51.269> I

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
entering terrain so what I did was I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.080 
entering terrain so what I did was I
