00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.080 

this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.709> attempt<00:00:02.129> at<00:00:02.190> building<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.639> 3d

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
this is my attempt at building a 3d

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.579 
this is my attempt at building a 3d
persistence<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.140> vision<00:00:04.200> display<00:00:06.470> you<00:00:07.470> may

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
persistence of vision display you may

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.870 
persistence of vision display you may
have<00:00:07.620> seen<00:00:07.859> displays<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.490> before

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
have seen displays like this before

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.669 
have seen displays like this before
we're<00:00:09.210> basically<00:00:09.360> moving<00:00:10.050> lights<00:00:10.410> through

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
we're basically moving lights through

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.080 
we're basically moving lights through
the<00:00:10.769> air<00:00:10.860> very<00:00:11.099> quickly<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.820> sort<00:00:12.000> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the air very quickly you can sort of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.970 
the air very quickly you can sort of
trace<00:00:12.300> out<00:00:12.540> sort<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.929> patterns<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.650> writing

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
trace out sort of patterns and writing

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.849 
trace out sort of patterns and writing
and<00:00:14.070> stuff<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:15.330> i'm<00:00:15.450> doing<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> using

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and stuff what i'm doing here is using

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.429 
and stuff what i'm doing here is using
eight<00:00:17.340> different<00:00:17.970> layers<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.630> these<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.230> try

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
eight different layers of these to try

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.830 
eight different layers of these to try
and<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.830> extra<00:00:20.250> level<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.910> depth<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.720> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and get an extra level of depth to this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890 
and get an extra level of depth to this
thing<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.910> i<00:00:23.910> thought<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.570> might<00:00:24.720> give<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
thing so that i thought it might give a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
thing so that i thought it might give a
good<00:00:25.050> 3d<00:00:25.470> effect<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.070> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> things

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
good 3d effect of kind of things

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.630 
good 3d effect of kind of things
floating<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> air<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> basically

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
floating in the air and so basically

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.160 
floating in the air and so basically
it's<00:00:29.730> made<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.240> eight<00:00:31.250> of<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:33.170> circuit

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's made up of eight of these circuit

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
it's made up of eight of these circuit
boards<00:00:34.610> made<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.820> press<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> peel<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
boards made using press and peel and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.970 
boards made using press and peel and
eagle<00:00:37.969> each<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.149> contains<00:00:39.180> eight<00:00:39.930> green<00:00:40.590> LEDs

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
eagle each one contains eight green LEDs

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000 
eagle each one contains eight green LEDs
and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.280> shift<00:00:41.489> register<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.950> kind<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and the shift register and kind of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
and the shift register and kind of
strapped<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> bottom<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.210> there

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
strapped to the bottom of it all there

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.459 
strapped to the bottom of it all there
is<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.750> custom<00:00:46.230> Arduino<00:00:46.680> board<00:00:47.989> again<00:00:48.989> made

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
is a custom Arduino board again made

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.880 
is a custom Arduino board again made
using<00:00:49.739> press<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.579> Peele<00:00:50.730> staff<00:00:51.030> home<00:00:51.329> etched

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
using press and Peele staff home etched

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
using press and Peele staff home etched
and<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.730> synchronized<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.910> its<00:00:57.120> spin

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and this is synchronized with its spin

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.560 
and this is synchronized with its spin
by<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> magnetic<00:00:58.289> sensor<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.039> every<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.570> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
by a magnetic sensor so every time the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.219 
by a magnetic sensor so every time the
board<00:01:00.780> spins<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.949> passes<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.489> magnet<00:01:03.229> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
board spins it passes this magnet and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.630 
board spins it passes this magnet and
that<00:01:04.589> tells<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> where<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> start<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that tells it where the start of the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
that tells it where the start of the
rotation<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
rotation is and that and that kind of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.960 
rotation is and that and that kind of
starts<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.409> counting<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:11.070> interrupt

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
starts up the counting in interrupt

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
starts up the counting in interrupt
handler<00:01:12.270> inside<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> code<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.799> tries

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
handler inside the code which then tries

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.359 
handler inside the code which then tries
to<00:01:14.729> trace<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.680> stable<00:01:16.680> pattern<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> air

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to trace out a stable pattern in the air

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.050 
to trace out a stable pattern in the air
so<00:01:18.330> let's<00:01:18.450> fly<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.689> thing<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:22.759> Bobby<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> go

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
so let's fly this thing up Bobby up go

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
so let's fly this thing up Bobby up go
and<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.840> randomly<00:01:25.650> popping<00:01:25.950> some

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and here we go randomly popping some

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.100 
and here we go randomly popping some
point<00:01:26.490> since<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110
