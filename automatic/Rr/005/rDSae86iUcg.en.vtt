00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this this kind of shape the blade shape

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.410

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that's the that's the problem here we

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's the that's the problem here we
want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> maximize<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.860> blades<00:01:44.689> performance

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
want to maximize the blades performance

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.910 
want to maximize the blades performance
by<00:01:46.409> using<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.280> strength<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.320> see<00:01:49.320> goes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
by using the strength and you see goes

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.389 
by using the strength and you see goes
to<00:01:50.100> open<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.759> false<00:01:51.329> edge<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to open a false edge here so this is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.980 
to open a false edge here so this is a
very<00:01:53.729> good<00:01:53.970> stabbing<00:01:54.659> plane<00:01:55.939> like<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.149> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
very good stabbing plane like that it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
very good stabbing plane like that it's
like<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> beggar<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.979> good<00:01:59.219> stabbing<00:01:59.759> right

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
like a beggar it's good stabbing right

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.080 
like a beggar it's good stabbing right
good<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.450> stabbing<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.549> instead<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> using<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
good for stabbing so instead of using it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.139 
good for stabbing so instead of using it
like<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> okay<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.610> simple<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
like this okay which is very simple and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.880 
like this okay which is very simple and
everyone<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:06.899> how<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> use<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.500> will

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
everyone can know how to use it will

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.229 
everyone can know how to use it will
switch<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> blade<00:02:08.759> over<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:11.150> when<00:02:12.150> we

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
switch the blade over like this when we

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
switch the blade over like this when we
hold<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.690> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
hold it like so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.880 
hold it like so
but<00:02:13.859> this<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.219> the<00:02:14.370> cutting<00:02:14.700> edge<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> your

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
but this is the cutting edge and your

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.520 
but this is the cutting edge and your
finger<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.849> thumb<00:02:18.329> can<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.409> be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
finger the thumb can put here can be

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.899 
finger the thumb can put here can be
placed<00:02:19.859> here<00:02:22.219> why<00:02:23.219> do<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.700> thumb
