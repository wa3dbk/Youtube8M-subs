00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.030
 now a bonus because it 's a non-issue 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.160
 neither positive nor negative is one thing 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.110
 that goes for each one and I myself do not have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.380
 a defined position that is the factor that 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.180
 this season marks one they 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220
 show that it is increasingly 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.169
 distancing himself from the books was 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.610
 following his own course will tell his 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.640
 own history the producers want 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.860
 do seven seasons and marketing wants to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.550
 launch two more books with more than 2 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.140
 thousand pages 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.970
 I'm sure these three 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.469
 seasons and if they want to do not 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.329
 sufficient to cover what the 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.129
 marketing and to count two books of 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.719
 more than two thousand pages that any 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.089
 the next day they have already declared 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.010
 spend an afternoon with martin arguing 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.300
 each character he intended to do 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.129
 with history of each of these 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.690
 characters that also for him already 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.429
 knowing one of the characters they 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.920
 they can build another bow 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.510
 narrative has already achieved this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.579
 I think it makes perfect sense not to 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.050
 have people losing there in the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.730
 the question is the following with this 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.140
 season where we already had there 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.370
 site question uol that this thing that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.110
 for those who accompanied the book did not read 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.880
 being one of the books is an unprecedented fact 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.680
 people will start getting more and more series 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 take your own course then 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.500
 probably next season to 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 People already see things that are not 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.729
 The book will start to see others. 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.159
 aspects of white for example that 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.960
 Also we did not see in the book so I 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.170
 I think so, what's the problem with that? 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.000
 The whole story is first an agent to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.829
 series finishes first than the book 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.750
 so we see in the series aa people 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.030
 I knew what was going to happen that although the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.820
 book make different the book be better 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.500
 We already know the story that he already 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.329
 Wanna tell me, please excuse me? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.520
 they are doubted that in the series will be 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.810
 so epic tale will be in the book tells the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.460
 story you want to tell in the book I 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.500
 I think that history began in the book has 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.210
 finish the book and especially not 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.219
 I think the Martin tooth will write more 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.420
 fast with speeding up his work not 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.280
 I think that marketing has to have the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 time he wants to make a book. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.579
 to do his work in the best way 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.380
 I do not think you have to do it. 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.640
 running to achieve seriousness for 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.469
 fulfill the desire for fame then the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.090
 problem is we have two works go 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.920
 in parallel with similar stories 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.410
 but that each has its particularity 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 and from there they are in the middle running behind 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.500
 They must be competing with 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.660
 another then a negative positive point 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.460
 I am very much afraid to follow the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.200
 next season will end up knowing more 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.210
 things that I would like to read the book 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.070
 so for those who just do not know 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.990
 will not be a problem but for whom 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.790
 buying the books is certainly a 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.230
 thing that we have to stay connected to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.580
 signal and yellow signal to these 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.080
 producers or certainly want to see the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.280
 end of the ice and fire chronicles but I 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.100
 I do not know if I want to see the end of the game. 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.760
 of thrones then yellow sign 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.760
 I do not know what to expect.
