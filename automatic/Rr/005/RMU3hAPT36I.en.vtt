00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
around area not anywhere else on the map

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.380 
around area not anywhere else on the map
which<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.100> lot<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.310> people<00:03:43.430> play<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.330> way

probably that crate that red crate right

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.729 
probably that crate that red crate right
there<00:03:49.549> yeah<00:03:49.880> that's<00:03:50.630> probably<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.140> other<00:03:51.320> one

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
there yeah that's probably the other one

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.539 
there yeah that's probably the other one
of<00:03:52.630> like<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.660> limit<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.890> yeah<00:03:57.890> like
