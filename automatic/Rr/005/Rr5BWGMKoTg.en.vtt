00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.780
 very exciting because it is protection 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 do champion champions and understand what 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 that challenger chris who is with me 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 he will come out as motivated as 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 last fight stuff I was i'm afraid that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.770
 meet the same challenger as was 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.260
 I myself because I was ready to die to us 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.289
 in the ring his rival Chris camp ate for 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.629
 spent his career 19 fights and they all 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.299
 ended in victory in his favor 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 he is a very strong fighter and a lot of pressure 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.530
 during the fight but i will use my 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.560
 intelligence and skills I thought it would be 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 great fight initially fight 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.979
 planned to spend on sports 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 site in us for a conflict but 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.360
 thanks to an agreement with mikhail

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.900

 tom to have this fight right there i 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.150
 great motivation and generally this 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.790

 Ruslana in New York is very large here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.729

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.310

 Salgir faith clever movable boxing for soup 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.270
 and two different styles 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.790

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.660
 a year and a half ago and the conductors and almost 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.489
