 canada and was hawk 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 the game may have been invented from 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.930
 England 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
 american cloth 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.550
 so the chance was for the Brazilians 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 who won medals in the race for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 teams 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 after beating Canada in the semi-final 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 gustavo tsubói hugo calderano and tiago

 Paraguayans and managed to score 3 to 0 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 it's very rewarding to win this medal 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 I'm very happy with this 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 happiness is too great to achieve 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.439
 this gold medal especially 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.200
 my first bread 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 I hope I still have a lot ahead of me 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.560
 and I think that I, together with my 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 fellows we managed to make a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 very good job to get you in 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.689
 but I think every country has its 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.530
 story is the emotion I feel now 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.979
 It's different but not the least 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 Feeling the fans while the boys 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.700
 maintained the title of champions 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 the Brazilian players have achieved a 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.310
 historical result were until the end a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.920
 unprecedented fact for the female team they 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 They fought a lot in the end, right? 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.040
 were defeated but what's worth is this is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 who fought and won this silver is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.509
 we will definitely win more 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390
 motivation to keep fighting more 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.740
 trust and already think of others 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 horizons there 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.520
 lacked will but the North American 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.970
 were better 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 It's sad but at the same time it's very 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 very rewarding is very good to have a lot 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.620
 I am very happy to have been part of the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.770
 team that made history for tennis 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.170
 women in the pan american games still 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.810
 not over for the tennis athletes of 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 table that will compete for medals in the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.520
 individual category but the results 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.350
 of teams here in toronto 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.980
