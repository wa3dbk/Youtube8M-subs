 Hello, people , welcome, one more. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 pearl program episode 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 gospel 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.220
 in today's episode we will talk about 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.010
 Biblical monotheism 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.710
 we know that the old testament was 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:33.530
 written by Jews by people of the people 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.750
 Hebrew prophets scribes priests 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 persons responsible for transmitting a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 message of hope faith in God 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
 single 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.520
 but in what consists the monotheism of the people 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.820
 today in our culture 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 extremely visual in that we just 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.800
 we can understand a subject when 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.949
 show us an image 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.010
 a picture a picture 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.590
 it is difficult to understand the monotheism of 3 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.860
 a thousand years ago 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 the monotheism of the people gave is quite 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.740
 abstract for the season 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 just remember that most people 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:25.049
 temples altars and gods that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.900
 were depicted in the form of statues of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.329
 engravings and paintings 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.000
 at that time to look like a nomadic people who 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 starts talking about a single god 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 a god who created all the bad things 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 that has no paint is no 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 sculpture and no image of this god 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.560
 it is quite challenging and it was 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 with this challenging message from a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 Purely pure spiritual monotheism which 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.489
 we find the message of the people 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 Hebrew being portrayed poetically 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:14.180
 and exciting in the pages of the old 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.590
 testament with reference to this 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.810
 monotheism 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 we will find chapter 4 of the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.939
 gospel of Jesus when Jesus meets 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.930
 be with the Samaritan woman 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:30.859
 he told her so there will be a time 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:34.129
 in which God will be the golden in spirit and 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:39.430
 in truth it was a ransom that jesus 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:42.670
 he made of himself pure monotheism without images 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.950
 portraying the creator in the most 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.220
 possible without resorting to 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.769
 engraving without resorting to statues without 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.849
 to use paintings of any kind 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.889
 Image 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:02.659
 a transcendent god outside the 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:06.019
 creation but a god too and manet what 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:10.639
 is present in his work accompanies the 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:14.840
 comforting their children by clarifying 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:18.500
 pitying and acting daily 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.980
 this is biblical monotheism and it is about 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.819
 this theme that we have to meditate for 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.739
 understand some key lessons 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.739
 especially lessons from the gospel
