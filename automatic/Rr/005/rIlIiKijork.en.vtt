each Center goes in hell in these

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
each Center goes in hell in these
different<00:01:22.860> circles<00:01:23.190> he's<00:01:23.430> literally<00:01:23.790> like

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
different circles he's literally like

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
different circles he's literally like
laying<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> map<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.619> hell<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:25.979> palm

laying out a map of hell that palm

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
laying out a map of hell that palm
itself<00:01:26.910> is<00:01:27.119> disturbing<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.290> describes

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
itself is disturbing and it describes

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
itself is disturbing and it describes
the<00:01:28.800> different<00:01:29.310> rings<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.550> hell<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.150> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the different rings of hell and all this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.749 
the different rings of hell and all this
anguish<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.110> suffering<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.640> that's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
anguish and suffering and I think that's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.370 
anguish and suffering and I think that's
also<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.300> most<00:01:33.330> appealing<00:01:33.840> aspects

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
also one of the most appealing aspects

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.290 
also one of the most appealing aspects
