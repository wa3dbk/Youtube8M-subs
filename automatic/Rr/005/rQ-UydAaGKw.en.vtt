00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.199 
everybody was intense focus way just
like<00:02:27.530> concentration<00:02:28.250> wasn't<00:02:28.550> there<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
like concentration wasn't there the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.090 
like concentration wasn't there the
whole<00:02:29.390> game<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.930> match<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.739> lost<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
whole game and match we lost the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.160 
whole game and match we lost the
shooters<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.610> saw<00:02:31.760> 24<00:02:32.330> not<00:02:32.570> going<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.930> three

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
shooters you saw 24 not going like three

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.290 
shooters you saw 24 not going like three
threes<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.620> second<00:02:33.950> half<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:35.239> think

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
threes in the second half and I think

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 
threes in the second half and I think
that<00:02:35.570> was<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.050> difference<00:02:36.440> maker<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that was like the difference maker and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250 
that was like the difference maker and
then<00:02:37.070> just<00:02:37.670> him<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.150> stop<00:02:38.660> play<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.140> know

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
then just him to stop play just know

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.920 
then just him to stop play just know
what<00:02:39.440> he<00:02:39.500> does<00:02:39.709> best
