we want a positive result we just keep

we want a positive result we just keep
repeating<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.170> habit<00:00:37.620> over<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
thinking about it most of the things

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
thinking about it most of the things
that<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> us<00:00:42.750> over<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> course<00:00:43.890> of

that we do all of us over the course of

that we do all of us over the course of
a<00:00:44.100> day<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.700> decision<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
a day is not a decision we actually do

a day is not a decision we actually do
it<00:00:46.020> unconsciously<00:00:46.230> without<00:00:46.980> even<00:00:47.250> thinking

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it unconsciously without even thinking

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
it unconsciously without even thinking
we<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:48.629> few<00:00:48.750> decisions<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we make very few decisions over the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
we make very few decisions over the
course<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> day<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.879> think

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
course of the day if you actually think

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.880 
course of the day if you actually think
about<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> things<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.379> did<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> last

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
about all the things you did in the last

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
about all the things you did in the last
24<00:00:53.460> hours<00:00:53.520> most<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
24 hours most of them you do all the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.540 
24 hours most of them you do all the
time<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.590> only<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
time you only have to think about you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
time you only have to think about you
just<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.690> anyway<00:00:58.079> bench<00:00:58.350> plus<00:00:58.620> response

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
just do it so anyway bench plus response

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.580 
just do it so anyway bench plus response
equals<00:00:59.430> outcome<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> means<00:01:00.590> when

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
equals outcome this what it means when

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
equals outcome this what it means when
events<00:01:02.280> change<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.930> had<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.260> change<00:01:04.500> your

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
events change you had to change your

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.120 
events change you had to change your
response<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> times<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:07.260> see

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
response and a lot of times we see

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
response and a lot of times we see
events<00:01:08.549> change<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.420> keep<00:01:09.630> doing<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
events change but we keep doing the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
events change but we keep doing the
exact<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.409> response<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.670> realize

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
exact same response and then we realize

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.550 
exact same response and then we realize
that<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.270> outcome<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.869> changing<00:01:13.260> were<00:01:13.409> like

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that our outcome is changing were like

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.780 
that our outcome is changing were like
why<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.950> happening<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.490> we're<00:01:14.760> not

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
why is this happening why we're not

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460 
why is this happening why we're not
getting<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.390> outcome<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.259> because

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
getting the same outcome it's because

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
getting the same outcome it's because
the<00:01:17.159> event<00:01:17.460> change<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.090> didn't<00:01:18.299> change

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the event change but we didn't change

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.789 
the event change but we didn't change
our<00:01:18.630> response<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:19.229> didn't<00:01:19.439> change<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
our response we didn't change the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
our response we didn't change the
equation<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.150> got<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.780> plus<00:01:22.170> two

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
equation so if we got two plus two

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
equation so if we got two plus two
equals<00:01:22.439> four<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.689> two

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
equals four but then that first two

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
equals four but then that first two
becomes<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.770> 1<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.000> still<00:01:27.210> only

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
becomes a 1 and then we're still only

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330 
becomes a 1 and then we're still only
adding<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> rest<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> outcome

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
adding two then the rest in the outcome

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310 
adding two then the rest in the outcome
is<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:29.850> only<00:01:29.970> getting<00:01:30.150> three<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
is we're only getting three now and but

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
is we're only getting three now and but
I<00:01:31.380> damn<00:01:31.619> why<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.009> only<00:01:32.040> getting<00:01:32.430> three<00:01:32.460> why<00:01:32.850> do

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I damn why we only getting three why do

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
I damn why we only getting three why do
we<00:01:33.090> keep<00:01:33.270> getting<00:01:33.479> three<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.439> understand

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we keep getting three I don't understand

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
we keep getting three I don't understand
why<00:01:35.040> i'm<00:01:35.130> only<00:01:35.310> getting<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.939> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
why i'm only getting three now it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
why i'm only getting three now it's
because<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:36.990> terms<00:01:37.380> were<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.860> we're

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
because the two terms were one and we're

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.830 
because the two terms were one and we're
throwing<00:01:38.579> putting<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.479> add<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
throwing putting in the two to add to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
throwing putting in the two to add to
the<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.680> becoming<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.100> three<00:01:41.340> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the one and it's becoming a three we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
the one and it's becoming a three we
used<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.909> ended<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.509> being<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.049> tooth

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
used to be ended it being a tooth

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.870 
used to be ended it being a tooth
hopefully<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> didn't<00:01:44.310> lose<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.759> with

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
hopefully I didn't lose out there with

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
hopefully I didn't lose out there with
that<00:01:44.909> simple<00:01:45.360> math<00:01:45.509> equation<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.799> would<00:01:47.009> have

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that simple math equation you would have

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
that simple math equation you would have
to<00:01:47.159> change<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.610> 2<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> 3<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.770> for

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to change your 2 to a 3 to make up for

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.440 
to change your 2 to a 3 to make up for
the<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.360> get

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the one that you all so that you can get

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
the one that you all so that you can get
it<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> people<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.640> do

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it for you but a lot of people don't do

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
it for you but a lot of people don't do
this<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.689> creatures<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.350> habit

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
this because we are creatures of habit

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.859 
this because we are creatures of habit
