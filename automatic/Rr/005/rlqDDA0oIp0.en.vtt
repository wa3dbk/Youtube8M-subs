00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.259
 therefore stock market the topic of today on the street 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.429
 me 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.310
 Carlos Kunkel every stroke you execute 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.839
 you must transfer the weight to the ball 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.130
 that is to say with this there is nothing else what to spend the weight of our body 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.470
 to the ball 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.219
 it is not the same to hit only with the arm with the hand because the 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.670
 ball will lose strength speed 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.900
 to take care of her with the transfer of weight is going to give you a very 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.020
 simple 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 suppose they were thrown friend to the pool between two people 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 one takes it from the arms and the other from the legs 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.060
 of art this way 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 and we make this movement 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.370
 because as you can see the other person because it is profiled and seeing 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.599
 What's left next to him has his legs open 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.040
 to be balanced and then go 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 then as you can observe 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.490
 and that man entity explains as an educator then the left foot is in front 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.710
 which is the support foot and the back foot ends in a point 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.570
 since we can not compare the weight of a person with that of a ball 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.900
 but this does not serve to understand the principles that we have to do 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.100
 to effectively transfer 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.630
 the weight of abortion 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.509
 Of course we can do it only shot without being profiled with closed legs 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.530
 let's see with the pure heart and so on 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.080
 the ball may pass 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.340
 but not having the weight and speed that we seek 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.300
 so if we follow the concepts that I mentioned 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.180
 the ball will always have weight 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.250
 and it will be hard country opponents 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 as you can observe 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 rolle federer 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.830
 first of all the ball is shaped like that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 to then be able to turn effectively 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.850
 then open your legs comfortably to be in balance 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 if he were closed 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.179
 the weight of the ball that comes over him 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.889
 I would send it back 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.309
 then to be comfortably with the legs open 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.249
 balanced 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.109
 then start to rotate shoulders and hips 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.629
 that is where the weight is effectively transferred 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.619
 forward 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.979
 or do work 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.649
 after the left foot 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.609
 to be ahead 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.779
 already has all the weight 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.019
 on that foot 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.909
 and the back end points 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.509
 at the end it ends in front with the shoulders turned and hip 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 i effectively transfer 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.709
 we have another form of federer 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.409
 as you can observe 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.069
 does the same 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.429
 profiling 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.369
 with legs open 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.099
 start to turn shoulders and hips 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.349
 the left foot ends with the weight of your body 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.199
 the right foot left behind 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.779
 at the end after going all the weight of the ball 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.559
 and ends of faith 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.369
 here we have another video of yelena already with two 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.659
 although she with her style but finally has the same principles 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.319
 or can observe 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.889
 it is profiled 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.219
 the legs are comfortably open 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 if they were I know how it starts to turn shoulders and hips 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.529
 in the end 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.699
 the left foot ends in front 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.069
 with his weight 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.069
 of the right foot ends strass 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.509
 It is important to mention that we have to do these movements at 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.779
 same time that comes work 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.419
 if for example we throw the shoulders and hips before the arrival 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.549
 ball 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.150
 We are not going to effectively transfer the weight, but in hama we are going to 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.809
 paste 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.649
 'with the ass works 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:03.649
 same way if we advance the right leg 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:08.459
 we are going to transfer from the weight to the leg, be it a side 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 we will not transfer it forward 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.309
 to put on the suit that those terms we've talked about 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.849
 and your shot will have much more speed 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.239
 much more weight 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.579
 and your opponent will hurt you a lot 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.340
 remember the practice makes the master see you at court nin
