go under here this is display render

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.220 
go under here this is display render
settings<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> settings

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
settings and this is all the settings

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.000 
settings and this is all the settings
you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.620> save<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> Maya<00:00:56.879> iff<00:00:57.920> just<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you can do save it to a Maya iff just a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
you can do save it to a Maya iff just a
heads<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.230> then<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> frame

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
heads up and then this is the frame

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
heads up and then this is the frame
padding<00:01:04.619> i<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:04.920> say<00:01:05.040> give<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.309> frame

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
padding i would say give it frame

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.700 
padding i would say give it frame
padding<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> about<00:01:06.270> three<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> has

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
padding to about three that way it has

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.840 
padding to about three that way it has
like<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.040> cushion<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.770> then<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:11.670> are

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
like some cushion and then these are

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
like some cushion and then these are
where<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> start<00:01:12.510> frame<00:01:12.780> rates<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.530> right

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
where the start frame rates are right

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.140 
where the start frame rates are right
here<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> mind<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:16.979> no<00:01:17.280> frame<00:01:17.640> rates<00:01:17.880> because

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
here so mind has no frame rates because

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
here so mind has no frame rates because
i<00:01:18.360> didn't<00:01:18.540> animate<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:18.900> anything<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
i didn't animate or anything so it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
i didn't animate or anything so it's
just<00:01:21.210> 0<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.020> 110<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.350> all

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
just 0 it's just 110 so if you do all

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
just 0 it's just 110 so if you do all
the<00:01:25.920> frame<00:01:26.100> weighs<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.400> let's<00:01:26.580> say<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> have

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the frame weighs like let's say you have

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.950 
the frame weighs like let's say you have
200<00:01:27.630> frames<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.579> 200<00:01:30.210> you're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
200 frames and you do what 200 you're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.749 
200 frames and you do what 200 you're
the<00:01:31.290> batch<00:01:31.470> render<00:01:31.680> will<00:01:31.920> crash<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.610> heads

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the batch render will crash just a heads

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.490 
the batch render will crash just a heads
up<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.509> maybe<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:34.380> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
up so do you like maybe them in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
up so do you like maybe them in
intervals<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.950> 10<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.250> intervals<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.820> 20<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
intervals of 10 or intervals of 20 so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
intervals of 10 or intervals of 20 so
then<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.259> done<00:01:37.560> it'll<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
then they will get done it'll be a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
then they will get done it'll be a
little<00:01:38.520> slower<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.479> won't<00:01:39.780> crash<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
little slower but it won't crash I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.880 
little slower but it won't crash I
promise<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.960> alright<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.790> then

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
promise you that alright so then

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.649 
promise you that alright so then

it's out of this this or this it's
usually<00:02:47.930> images<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.590> me<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:49.700> sometimes<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
usually images for me but sometimes it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.850 
usually images for me but sometimes it
will<00:02:50.420> save<00:02:50.720> into<00:02:50.900> cash<00:02:51.140> sometimes<00:02:51.709> we'll

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
will save into cash sometimes we'll

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.620 
will save into cash sometimes we'll
savings<00:02:52.220> eclipse<00:02:53.920> alright<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.100> after<00:02:55.220> that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
savings eclipse alright so after that

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.100 
savings eclipse alright so after that
once<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.720> find<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.640> go<00:02:58.640> into<00:02:58.970> apps<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.990> is

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
once you find it go into apps this is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.550 
once you find it go into apps this is
haraam<00:03:00.500> windows<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:01.250> heads<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:02.350> check<00:03:03.350> f

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
haraam windows just heads up check f

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.020 
haraam windows just heads up check f
check<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:06.230> turn<00:03:06.800> your<00:03:07.100> images<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:07.820> a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
check this will turn your images into a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.020 
check this will turn your images into a
movie<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.260> go<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.440> open<00:03:09.770> sequence<00:03:12.760> I'll<00:03:13.760> just

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.610 
movie so go to open sequence I'll just
use<00:03:14.209> my<00:03:14.239> I'll<00:03:14.570> just<00:03:14.750> use<00:03:14.870> my<00:03:14.900> Davey<00:03:15.170> final

these that is my final now it's all it's
all<00:03:35.989> really<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.380> sped<00:03:36.800> up<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.220> don't

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
all really really sped up but don't

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.090 
all really really sped up but don't
worry<00:03:38.090> about<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.540> it's<00:03:39.380> going<00:03:39.739> as<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> can

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
worry about that it's going as you can

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.860 
worry about that it's going as you can
see<00:03:40.250> as<00:03:40.550> fast<00:03:40.970> as<00:03:41.180> Superman<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.980> do<00:03:43.100> this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
see as fast as Superman so you do this

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.600 
see as fast as Superman so you do this
save<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.019> movie<00:03:49.390> blah<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:51.100> save<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.370> under

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
save as movie blah I save it just under

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.070 
save as movie blah I save it just under
movies<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.209> then<00:03:54.040> save<00:03:55.660> sure<00:03:56.660> these

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
movies and then save sure these

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.960 
movies and then save sure these
transformations<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:57.980> then<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.459> up<00:03:59.739> as<00:04:00.970> you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
transformations and then it's up as you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.540 
transformations and then it's up as you
did<00:04:02.150> well<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.750> after<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:04.010> just<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.340> into

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
did well and after that you just go into

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.039 
did well and after that you just go into
movies<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:08.450> right<00:04:08.570> there<00:04:10.690> so<00:04:11.690> rendering

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
movies it's right there so rendering

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.220 
movies it's right there so rendering
actually<00:04:12.410> isn't<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.680> hard<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:14.840> fairly

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
actually isn't that hard it's fairly

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.250 
actually isn't that hard it's fairly
simple<00:04:15.590> it's<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:17.030> sometimes<00:04:17.209> on<00:04:18.020> sometimes

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
simple it's just sometimes on sometimes

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.870 
simple it's just sometimes on sometimes
if<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.560> don't<00:04:18.739> do<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:18.890> in<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.130> while<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.729> will

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
if you don't do it in a while you will

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.250 
if you don't do it in a while you will
kind<00:04:20.150> of<00:04:20.270> forget<00:04:20.539> it

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
kind of forget it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.010 
kind of forget it
but<00:04:24.860> I'll<00:04:25.860> just<00:04:25.920> reiterate<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:26.780> batch<00:04:27.780> render

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
but I'll just reiterate for batch render

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.950 
but I'll just reiterate for batch render
go<00:04:28.830> under<00:04:29.070> rendering<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.790> then<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.840> can

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
go under rendering and then you can

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.940 
go under rendering and then you can
either<00:04:31.080> do<00:04:31.760> render<00:04:32.760> settings<00:04:33.620> which<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.830> you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
either do render settings which then you

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.340 
either do render settings which then you
can<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.600> change<00:04:36.600> as<00:04:36.840> much<00:04:36.960> as<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.170> want<00:04:37.410> oh

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
can just change as much as you want oh

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.140 
can just change as much as you want oh
yeah<00:04:40.350> also<00:04:42.230> this<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.410> quality<00:04:44.030> under<00:04:45.030> my

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
yeah also this is the quality under my

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.940 
yeah also this is the quality under my
software<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.840> quality<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:48.950> would

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
software this is quality I would

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.920 
software this is quality I would
probably<00:04:50.220> say<00:04:50.490> go<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.000> intermediate<00:04:51.720> or

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
probably say go to intermediate or

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.360 
probably say go to intermediate or
production<00:04:52.290> quality<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.980> will<00:04:53.070> take<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.250> little

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
production quality it will take a little

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.420 
production quality it will take a little
while<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.240> would<00:04:54.510> be<00:04:54.690> better<00:04:58.130> like<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.340> you

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
while but it would be better like if you

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.160 
while but it would be better like if you
do<00:04:59.730> intermediate<00:05:00.450> it'll<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:00.930> be<00:05:00.990> highest

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
do intermediate it'll just be highest

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.050 
do intermediate it'll just be highest
quality<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:01.860> then<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.550> will<00:05:02.760> give<00:05:02.910> you<00:05:03.030> a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
quality so then this will give you a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.580 
quality so then this will give you a
higher<00:05:03.300> quality<00:05:03.510> through<00:05:03.960> your<00:05:04.080> animation

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
higher quality through your animation

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.690 
higher quality through your animation
which<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.580> nice<00:05:05.730> oh<00:05:09.770> well<00:05:10.770> after<00:05:11.160> that<00:05:11.310> all

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
which is nice oh well after that all

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.730 
which is nice oh well after that all
this<00:05:12.150> stuff<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.510> optional<00:05:12.960> all<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.470> rest<00:05:13.650> of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
this stuff is optional all the rest of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.190 
this stuff is optional all the rest of
the<00:05:13.830> stuff<00:05:13.950> is<00:05:14.070> optional<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:15.810> go<00:05:15.960> into<00:05:16.170> a

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
the stuff is optional so you go into a

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.650 
the stuff is optional so you go into a
higher<00:05:16.380> threshold<00:05:16.680> just<00:05:17.070> mini<00:05:17.430> man<00:05:18.000> if<00:05:18.510> you

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
higher threshold just mini man if you

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.020 
higher threshold just mini man if you
want<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:18.930> just<00:05:19.110> do<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.100> number<00:05:20.310> i<00:05:20.430> actually<00:05:20.940> do

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
want to just do the number i actually do

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.250 
want to just do the number i actually do
not<00:05:21.180> know<00:05:21.300> what<00:05:21.390> number<00:05:21.630> of<00:05:21.720> samples<00:05:22.050> means

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
not know what number of samples means

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.610 
not know what number of samples means
i'm<00:05:22.980> going<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.190> look<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.400> up<00:05:24.440> but<00:05:25.440> that's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
i'm going to look that up but that's

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.920 
i'm going to look that up but that's
about<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.100> actually<00:05:26.730> for<00:05:27.060> rent<00:05:27.570> per<00:05:27.780> batch

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
about it actually for rent per batch

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.780 
about it actually for rent per batch
render<00:05:28.140> it's<00:05:28.410> very<00:05:28.800> simple<00:05:29.070> it's<00:05:29.250> very<00:05:29.610> easy

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
render it's very simple it's very easy
