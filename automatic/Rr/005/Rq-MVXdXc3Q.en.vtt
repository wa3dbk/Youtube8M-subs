little baby sea turtles and they crawl
their<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> surface<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> sand

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
their way up to the surface of the sand

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910

and<00:00:42.780> once<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.170> reach<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> surface<00:00:43.590> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and once they reach the surface it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
and once they reach the surface it's
usually<00:00:44.040> nighttime<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.899> start

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
usually nighttime and they then start

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
usually nighttime and they then start
moving<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> ocean<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.090> are

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
moving to the ocean because they are

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.959 
moving to the ocean because they are
queued<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.230> -<00:00:49.590> starlight<00:00:50.160> shining<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.789> the

queued in - starlight shining off the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389 
queued in - starlight shining off the
water<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.500> brightness<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> natural

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
water that brightness in all the natural

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.639 
water that brightness in all the natural
darkness<00:00:53.699> tells<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
darkness tells them come this way and of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
darkness tells them come this way and of
course<00:00:55.829> once<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> ocean<00:00:56.489> will

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
course once they're in the ocean will

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549 
course once they're in the ocean will
they've<00:00:56.940> got<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> better<00:00:57.390> chance<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:58.020> surviving

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they've got a better chance of surviving

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
they've got a better chance of surviving
their<00:00:58.680> predators<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.699> better

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
their predators because they have better

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
their predators because they have better
maneuverability<00:01:00.059> better<00:01:00.870> places<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> little

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
maneuverability better places to little

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
maneuverability better places to little
guys<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> hide<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> hopefully<00:01:03.059> enough<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
guys to hide and hopefully enough of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
guys to hide and hopefully enough of
them<00:01:03.600> will<00:01:03.750> survive<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.409> species<00:01:04.949> will

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
them will survive the species will

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
them will survive the species will
perpetuate<00:01:05.700> itself<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:07.140> here's<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> problem

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
perpetuate itself but here's the problem

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980 
perpetuate itself but here's the problem
we<00:01:08.520> human<00:01:08.880> beings<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> live<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> these

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we human beings like to live on these

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
we human beings like to live on these
same<00:01:10.260> sandy<00:01:10.770> beaches<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:12.060> beaches

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
same sandy beaches and on those beaches

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
same sandy beaches and on those beaches
we<00:01:12.570> build<00:01:12.780> nightclubs<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> condominiums<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
we build nightclubs and condominiums and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
we build nightclubs and condominiums and
our<00:01:14.760> artificial<00:01:15.180> light<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:16.229> causes<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
our artificial light which causes the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
our artificial light which causes the
turtles<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> wrong<00:01:17.909> direction

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
turtles to go in the wrong direction

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
turtles to go in the wrong direction
they<00:01:19.020> crawl<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.530> into<00:01:19.710> our<00:01:19.860> city<00:01:20.040> streets<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they crawl up into our city streets and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
they crawl up into our city streets and
on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> sidewalks<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.810> run

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
on the sidewalks where they can get run

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
on the sidewalks where they can get run
over<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.320> cars<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:23.009> eaten<00:01:23.340> by<00:01:23.460> dogs<00:01:23.520> cats<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
over by cars maybe eaten by dogs cats a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
over by cars maybe eaten by dogs cats a
variety<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> problems<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.790> real

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
variety of problems and that's a real

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
variety of problems and that's a real
bad<00:01:27.299> problem<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.960> bad<00:01:28.200> situation<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bad problem a bad situation for the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.800 
bad problem a bad situation for the
Turtles<00:01:29.640> yeah<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.509> kind<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
Turtles yeah you know it's just kind of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
Turtles yeah you know it's just kind of
a<00:01:30.900> yucky<00:01:31.229> situation<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.950> human<00:01:32.189> beings

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
a yucky situation for human beings

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
a yucky situation for human beings
what's<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> solution<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> solution<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
what's the solution well the solution is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
what's the solution well the solution is
not<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> turn<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> lights<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.810> turn

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
not to turn the lights off but just turn

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
not to turn the lights off but just turn
the<00:01:37.110> lights<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.220> turn<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.549> down<00:01:38.820> enough

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the lights down to turn them down enough

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.929 
the lights down to turn them down enough
that<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.140> doesn't<00:01:40.710> over<00:01:41.250> brighten<00:01:41.729> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
example of where we're having to use

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.340 
example of where we're having to use
human<00:02:32.010> intervention<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.000> solve<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> problem

of human intervention which of course

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.220 
of human intervention which of course
just<00:02:37.580> easier<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.880> turn<00:02:39.600> down<00:02:39.630> those<00:02:39.989> lights

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
just easier if we turn down those lights

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.660 
just easier if we turn down those lights
in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> first<00:02:40.620> place
