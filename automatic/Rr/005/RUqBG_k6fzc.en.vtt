some of the fact that i do have left but
as<00:04:03.320> far<00:04:03.500> as<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.920> actual<00:04:04.990> exercises<00:04:05.990> that

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
as far as the actual exercises that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.250 
as far as the actual exercises that
you're<00:04:06.230> doing<00:04:07.570> body<00:04:08.570> beast<00:04:08.690> does<00:04:08.990> something

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
you're doing body beast does something

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.810 
you're doing body beast does something
called<00:04:09.470> dynamic<00:04:09.650> set<00:04:10.070> training<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:10.640> what<00:04:10.790> that

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
called dynamic set training so what that

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.700 
called dynamic set training so what that
means<00:04:11.210> is<00:04:11.660> one<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.500> aspects<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.070> is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
means is one of the aspects of that is

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.050 
means is one of the aspects of that is
determining<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.920> weight<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:16.790> i'm<00:04:16.880> going<00:04:16.970> to

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
determining a weight so i'm going to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.250 
determining a weight so i'm going to
start<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.359> low<00:04:17.540> weight<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.989> i'm<00:04:18.080> going<00:04:18.200> to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
start with a low weight and i'm going to

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.020 
start with a low weight and i'm going to
work<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.530> higher<00:04:18.710> rate<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.220> weight<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:19.850> where

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
work to a higher rate a weight and where

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.420 
work to a higher rate a weight and where
i'm<00:04:20.150> also<00:04:20.330> going<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.930> lower<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.859> reps<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:22.310> i

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
i'm also going to lower the reps as i

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.100 
i'm also going to lower the reps as i
move<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.790> higher<00:04:22.910> weight<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.479> i'm<00:04:23.780> going<00:04:23.960> to

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
move to a higher weight and i'm going to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.589 
move to a higher weight and i'm going to
do<00:04:24.259> that<00:04:24.439> move<00:04:24.680> back<00:04:24.949> to<00:04:25.159> back<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.460> back<00:04:25.599> with

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
do that move back to back to back with

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.240 
do that move back to back to back with
the<00:04:26.750> same<00:04:26.930> muscle<00:04:27.289> working<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.680> same<00:04:27.860> muscles

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the same muscle working the same muscles

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.270 
the same muscle working the same muscles
so<00:04:28.879> I<00:04:28.909> might<00:04:29.300> start<00:04:29.539> with<00:04:29.599> 5<00:04:29.870> pounds<00:04:30.409> as<00:04:31.099> i'm

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
so I might start with 5 pounds as i'm

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.399 
so I might start with 5 pounds as i'm
doing<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.550> shoulder<00:04:31.879> move<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.389> we're<00:04:32.780> doing<00:04:33.020> 15

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
doing a shoulder move and we're doing 15

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.290 
doing a shoulder move and we're doing 15
reps<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.949> then<00:04:34.280> i'm<00:04:34.370> going<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.580> go<00:04:34.639> 10<00:04:34.909> pounds

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
reps and then i'm going to go 10 pounds

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.179 
reps and then i'm going to go 10 pounds
of<00:04:35.360> our<00:04:35.509> own<00:04:35.599> you<00:04:35.750> do<00:04:35.870> 12<00:04:36.169> reps<00:04:36.259> and<00:04:36.620> then<00:04:37.099> i'll

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
of our own you do 12 reps and then i'll

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.860 
of our own you do 12 reps and then i'll
go<00:04:37.219> to<00:04:37.340> 15<00:04:37.729> pounds<00:04:37.909> we<00:04:38.150> really<00:04:38.419> going<00:04:38.509> to<00:04:38.569> do<00:04:38.659> 8

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
go to 15 pounds we really going to do 8

go to 15 pounds we really going to do 8
reps<00:04:39.129> and<00:04:40.129> then<00:04:40.400> i'll<00:04:41.060> even<00:04:41.389> i'll<00:04:41.689> drop<00:04:41.900> down

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
reps and then i'll even i'll drop down

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.379 
reps and then i'll even i'll drop down
await<00:04:42.409> get<00:04:43.370> back<00:04:43.490> down<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.699> 10<00:04:43.909> pounds<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.300> do

await get back down to 10 pounds and do

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.439 
await get back down to 10 pounds and do
8<00:04:44.539> reps<00:04:44.719> again<00:04:45.319> so<00:04:45.889> it's<00:04:46.699> working<00:04:46.969> that<00:04:47.270> muscle

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
8 reps again so it's working that muscle

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.980 
8 reps again so it's working that muscle
really<00:04:48.159> to<00:04:49.159> fatigue<00:04:49.520> we're<00:04:50.120> with<00:04:50.270> x2<00:04:50.569> I<00:04:50.689> kind

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
really to fatigue we're with x2 I kind

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.480 
really to fatigue we're with x2 I kind
of<00:04:51.020> think<00:04:51.139> yeah<00:04:51.379> you<00:04:51.439> worked<00:04:51.770> till<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.460> you

chests<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.779> our<00:05:14.990> biceps<00:05:15.500> okay<00:05:16.099> so<00:05:16.159> we're<00:05:16.490> just

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
chests in our biceps okay so we're just

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.490 
chests in our biceps okay so we're just
we're<00:05:17.240> focusing<00:05:17.659> on<00:05:17.840> areas<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.259> we're<00:05:18.409> not

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
we're focusing on areas and we're not

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.959 
we're focusing on areas and we're not
rotating<00:05:18.710> through<00:05:19.159> different<00:05:19.460> muscles<00:05:19.759> we're

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
rotating through different muscles we're

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.490 
rotating through different muscles we're
going<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.150> focus<00:05:20.270> on<00:05:20.509> one<00:05:20.659> area<00:05:20.689> before<00:05:21.289> moving

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
going to focus on one area before moving

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.200 
going to focus on one area before moving
on<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.830> next<00:05:21.949> so<00:05:22.669> that's<00:05:22.849> really<00:05:22.969> the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
on to the next so that's really the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.510 
on to the next so that's really the
biggest<00:05:23.779> difference<00:05:24.080> that<00:05:24.529> I've<00:05:24.650> noticed<00:05:25.069> um

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
biggest difference that I've noticed um

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.050 
biggest difference that I've noticed um
and<00:05:26.349> a<00:05:27.349> less<00:05:27.860> cardio<00:05:28.129> so<00:05:28.520> there's<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.729> cardio

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
and a less cardio so there's a cardio

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.829 
and a less cardio so there's a cardio
one<00:05:29.449> day<00:05:30.940> even<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.029> we<00:05:32.120> have<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.389> this<00:05:32.539> weekend

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
one day even if we have it this weekend

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.420 
one day even if we have it this weekend
if<00:05:32.930> there<00:05:33.020> was<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.169> cardio<00:05:33.469> into<00:05:34.129> the<00:05:34.250> schedule

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
if there was a cardio into the schedule

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.279 
if there was a cardio into the schedule
last<00:05:34.729> week<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.300> then<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.779> think<00:05:35.990> we<00:05:36.080> have<00:05:36.199> it

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
last week and then I think we have it

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.540 
last week and then I think we have it
again<00:05:36.469> next<00:05:36.650> week<00:05:36.889> but<00:05:37.009> I<00:05:37.069> don't<00:05:37.250> believe<00:05:37.400> we

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
again next week but I don't believe we

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.379 
again next week but I don't believe we
have<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.699> cardio<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.360> week<00:05:38.589> so<00:05:39.589> for<00:05:39.800> me
