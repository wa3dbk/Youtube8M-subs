so<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.970> impact<00:03:36.270> driver<00:03:36.680> when<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.770> hit<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
so that impact driver when you hit it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
so that impact driver when you hit it
with<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.550> hammer<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.000> drives<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.660> bit<00:03:39.989> into

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
with the hammer it drives the bit into

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.020 
with the hammer it drives the bit into
the<00:03:40.500> screw<00:03:40.800> as<00:03:41.040> well<00:03:41.340> as<00:03:41.520> turns<00:03:41.880> it

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the screw as well as turns it

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.270 
the screw as well as turns it
counterclockwise<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:43.620> how<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.860> works<00:03:44.040> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
counterclockwise that's how it works so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.750 
counterclockwise that's how it works so
well<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:48.890> spring<00:03:49.890> kroehner<00:03:50.100> was<00:03:50.340> still<00:03:50.550> good

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
well and spring kroehner was still good

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.070 
well and spring kroehner was still good
so<00:03:51.150> we're<00:03:51.330> just<00:03:51.360> gonna<00:03:51.540> go<00:03:51.660> ahead<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.840> put<00:03:52.019> it

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
so we're just gonna go ahead and put it

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.880 
so we're just gonna go ahead and put it
right<00:03:52.110> back<00:03:52.320> on<00:03:57.350> those<00:03:58.350> two<00:03:58.530> Phillips<00:03:58.860> head

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
right back on those two Phillips head

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.150 
right back on those two Phillips head
screws<00:03:59.010> use<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> impact<00:04:00.330> driver<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:01.890> get<00:04:02.040> out

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
screws use the impact driver to get out

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.270 
screws use the impact driver to get out
I<00:04:02.400> put<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.730> little<00:04:02.880> handy<00:04:03.390> C's<00:04:03.540> on<00:04:03.690> these<00:04:03.840> so

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280
