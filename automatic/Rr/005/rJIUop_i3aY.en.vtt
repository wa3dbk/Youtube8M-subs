00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
ride a bike go swimming I mean it's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.120 
ride a bike go swimming I mean it's
basically<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.960> looks<00:00:16.139> basically<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.590> place<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
basically it looks basically a place to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
basically it looks basically a place to
get<00:00:17.250> away<00:00:17.340> place<00:00:18.029> where<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.480> young<00:00:18.630> kids

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
get away place where I think young kids

get away place where I think young kids
to<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> find<00:00:19.890> themselves<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.699> think

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
