00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
which I haven't walked three days ago
this<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.500> diamond<00:00:26.039> took<00:00:26.550> me<00:00:26.789> about<00:00:28.250> other

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
this this diamond took me about other

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.630 
this this diamond took me about other
month<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> goal<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.399> gold

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
month that's it and the goal to get gold

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
month that's it and the goal to get gold
for<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.090> SVU<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> last<00:00:34.200> gonna<00:00:34.530> unbox

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
for my SVU which is the last gonna unbox

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
for my SVU which is the last gonna unbox
to<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.180> special<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.050> thought<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to make it special because I thought it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940 
to make it special because I thought it
would<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> hardest<00:00:39.500> it<00:00:40.500> took<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:40.829> about

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
would be the hardest it took me about

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450 
would be the hardest it took me about
three<00:00:41.309> days<00:00:41.489> i<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.030> say<00:00:42.980> darkness<00:00:43.980> gun<00:00:44.190> that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
three days i would say darkness gun that

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
three days i would say darkness gun that
it<00:00:44.640> took<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:45.059> probably<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.140> ballista<00:00:46.649> took<00:00:46.950> me

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it took me probably the ballista took me

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
it took me probably the ballista took me
about<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> week<00:00:48.840> together<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.360> i<00:00:51.739> didn't<00:00:52.739> i

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
about but a week together and i didn't i

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
about but a week together and i didn't i
am<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.550> seen<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.030> they've<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> still

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
am not seen what they've all this still

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
am not seen what they've all this still
looks<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.710> i'm<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.579> high<00:00:57.059> enough

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
looks like because i'm not a high enough

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
looks like because i'm not a high enough
rank<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.460> seen<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
rank to see it but i have seen it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880 
rank to see it but i have seen it
through<00:01:00.239> picking<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> ground

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
through picking it up on the ground

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.380 
through picking it up on the ground
anyways<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.140> thought<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.880> SVU<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> my

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
anyways I thought I do the SVU and my

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.320 
anyways I thought I do the SVU and my
first<00:01:06.630> video<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.290> diamonds<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.060> found

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
first video for diamonds because I found

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
first video for diamonds because I found
that<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> SVU<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.740> probably<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that the SVU was probably one of the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.960 
that the SVU was probably one of the
best<00:01:11.850> looking<00:01:12.060> kinda<00:01:12.689> need<00:01:12.840> snipers<00:01:13.820> side<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
best looking kinda need snipers side to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
best looking kinda need snipers side to
side<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.630> DSR<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.619> thought<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.310> was

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
side with the DSR I thought it was

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
side with the DSR I thought it was
really<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.170> right

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really cool because as you can see right

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.760 
really cool because as you can see right
on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.390> basically<00:01:21.869> our<00:01:22.049> own<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> gun

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
on the like basically our own with a gun

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
on the like basically our own with a gun
it's<00:01:23.689> covered<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> diamonds<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.740> also<00:01:26.729> think

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's covered in diamonds and also think

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's covered in diamonds and also think
that<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.509> realistic<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.259> another<00:01:28.619> way

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that it's not realistic in another way

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
that it's not realistic in another way
because<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.030> by<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.509> would<00:01:30.659> probably<00:01:31.110> cost

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
because one by one would probably cost

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
because one by one would probably cost
thousands<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> dollars<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.549> means<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> gun

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
thousands of dollars that means this gun

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
thousands of dollars that means this gun
is<00:01:33.150> probably<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.020> million<00:01:34.409> dollars

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is probably about a million dollars

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.760 
is probably about a million dollars
anyway<00:01:35.340> um<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> SVU<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:39.329> gold<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
anyway um the SVU how I got gold for it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.600 
anyway um the SVU how I got gold for it
was<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.759> i<00:01:41.790> did<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.570> i<00:01:42.710> did<00:01:43.710> hardcore<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> get

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
was what i did is i did hardcore to get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270 
was what i did is i did hardcore to get
my<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.060> shot<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.570> kill<00:01:45.740> which<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:47.009> really

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
my one shot one kill which was really

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.850 
my one shot one kill which was really
easy<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.360> should<00:01:48.600> use<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:49.619> i

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
easy what you should use which i

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.550 
easy what you should use which i
recommend<00:01:50.210> definitely<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> collar

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
recommend definitely is the a collar

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.770 
recommend definitely is the a collar
with<00:01:52.680> laser<00:01:53.100> sight<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.990> close<00:01:54.990> range<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
with laser sight so close range and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.780 
with laser sight so close range and
no<00:01:57.740> range<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.460> need<00:01:58.790> not<00:01:58.940> know<00:01:59.119> reach<00:01:59.360> sorry<00:01:59.900> um

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
no range I need not know reach sorry um

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.890 
no range I need not know reach sorry um
no<00:02:01.790> scope<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.200> with<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.600> thought<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
no scope so with the I thought that the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.320 
no scope so with the I thought that the
laser<00:02:06.110> sight<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.650> like<00:02:06.770> dead<00:02:07.159> on<00:02:07.369> compared<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
laser sight was like dead on compared to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.199 
laser sight was like dead on compared to
the<00:02:08.509> other<00:02:08.630> call<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.709> duty's<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.280> was<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:11.090> would

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
the other call of duty's it was it would

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
the other call of duty's it was it would
go<00:02:11.390> anywhere<00:02:11.569> really<00:02:11.990> there's<00:02:12.440> no<00:02:12.560> real<00:02:12.770> point

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
go anywhere really there's no real point

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
what I think is numb is that you have to

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.010 
what I think is numb is that you have to
get<00:05:44.760> what<00:05:44.970> their<00:05:45.210> season<00:05:45.510> with<00:05:45.570> your<00:05:45.750> sniper

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
get what their season with your sniper

get what their season with your sniper
