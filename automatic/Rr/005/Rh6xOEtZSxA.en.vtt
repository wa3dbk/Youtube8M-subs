video<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> made<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.920> 4<00:00:47.370> days<00:00:47.399> ago<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:48.000> was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

day<00:00:48.329> 6<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> 7<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.510> guess<00:00:51.570> would<00:00:51.989> be

day 6 and 7 so this my guess would be

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.779 
day 6 and 7 so this my guess would be
days<00:00:52.739> 8<00:00:53.460> through<00:00:53.879> 12<00:00:54.090> whatever<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> yeah<00:00:57.590> I

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
days 8 through 12 whatever so yeah I

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
days 8 through 12 whatever so yeah I
damn<00:00:59.789> right<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> stalled<00:01:01.280> for<00:01:02.280> a

think this is my gym letting each other

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.920 
think this is my gym letting each other
know<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:53.730> were<00:02:53.940> doing<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.690> everything

know how we were doing and everything

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.530 
know how we were doing and everything
and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:56.280> she<00:02:56.580> was<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.730> gee<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> don't<00:02:57.360> know

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and then she was like gee I don't know

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.310 
and then she was like gee I don't know
if<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.100> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.120 

I<00:03:01.370> think<00:03:02.370> her<00:03:03.290> wanting<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.320> quit<00:03:04.620> kind<00:03:05.040> of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
I think her wanting to quit kind of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.910 
I think her wanting to quit kind of
rubbed<00:03:05.340> off<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:05.790> me<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> she<00:03:06.930> started<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.860> she

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
rubbed off on me so she started so she

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.070 
rubbed off on me so she started so she
joined<00:03:08.190> Weight<00:03:08.430> Watchers

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
so I'm debating whether I should enjoy

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.390 
so I'm debating whether I should enjoy
Weight<00:03:11.970> Watchers<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.510> not<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.190> have<00:03:14.190> done

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400

Weight Watchers or not I have done
Weight<00:03:14.580> Watchers<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> past<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.780> can

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
Weight Watchers in the past and I can

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.350 
Weight Watchers in the past and I can
say<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.489> think<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.820> said<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
say and I think I said this in a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.180 
say and I think I said this in a
previous<00:03:18.570> video<00:03:18.930> before<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.920> was

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
previous video before that that was

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.460 
previous video before that that was
really<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.580> only<00:03:21.090> thing<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.630> worked<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.290> me

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
really the only thing that worked for me

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.330 
really the only thing that worked for me
like<00:03:23.630> honestly<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:26.420> love<00:03:27.620> maybe<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.830> 15

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
like honestly I love maybe like 15

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270 
like honestly I love maybe like 15
pounds<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.299> then<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.900> course<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.380> got<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.890> felt

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
pounds and then of course I got I felt

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.220 
pounds and then of course I got I felt
like<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.519> was<00:03:32.670> comfortable<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.810> stopped

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
like I was comfortable and I stopped

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.160 
like I was comfortable and I stopped
going<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:36.030> really<00:03:36.239> works<00:03:36.540> because<00:03:36.870> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
going but it really works because you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.020 
going but it really works because you
can<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.799> know<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.010> eat<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.640> can't<00:03:38.880> you're

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
can you know you eat you can't you're

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360 
can you know you eat you can't you're
blind<00:03:39.330> checkout<00:03:39.750> which<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.370> essentially

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
blind checkout which is essentially

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
blind checkout which is essentially
calorie<00:03:41.850> counting<00:03:42.360> almost<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.230> they<00:03:43.320> have

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
calorie counting almost that they have

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.280 
calorie counting almost that they have
their<00:03:43.680> own<00:03:43.709> formula<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.140> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
their own formula so it's like it's the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.210 
their own formula so it's like it's the
healthy<00:03:46.680> way<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.890> do<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.700> not

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
healthy way to do it it's not

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.690 
healthy way to do it it's not
it's<00:03:48.910> not<00:03:49.170> some<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.470> know<00:03:50.590> diet<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.490> like<00:03:51.670> a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
it's not some you know diet it's like a

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.280 
it's not some you know diet it's like a
lifestyle<00:03:52.270> change<00:03:52.510> which<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.900> really<00:03:53.170> what

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
lifestyle change which is really what

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.910 
lifestyle change which is really what
this<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.470> about

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
this is about

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.320 
this is about
and<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.830> really<00:03:56.830> trying<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.280> lose<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:58.090> much

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
and I just really trying to lose as much

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.060 
and I just really trying to lose as much
weight<00:03:58.390> as<00:03:58.720> possible<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:59.470> quickly<00:03:59.500> as

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
weight as possible as quickly as

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.660 
weight as possible as quickly as
possible

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
possible

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.850 
possible
and<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:02.020> would<00:04:02.170> think<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.470> I've<00:04:02.590> learned

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
and you would think that I've learned

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.740 
and you would think that I've learned
that<00:04:03.130> by<00:04:03.340> now<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.820> doesn't<00:04:04.240> really<00:04:04.390> work<00:04:04.690> that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
that by now it doesn't really work that

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.140 
that by now it doesn't really work that
way<00:04:04.990> but<00:04:05.710> I<00:04:06.190> still<00:04:07.090> fall<00:04:07.780> into<00:04:08.170> these<00:04:08.350> traps

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
way but I still fall into these traps

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.630 
way but I still fall into these traps
and<00:04:10.150> think<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:11.170> change<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.800> funny<00:04:12.400> way

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
and think that I can change it funny way

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.340 
and think that I can change it funny way
I<00:04:12.940> just<00:04:13.360> wanted<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.780> give<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:13.990> guys<00:04:14.050> two
