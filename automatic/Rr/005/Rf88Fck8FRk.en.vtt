00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.400
 she posted on youtube beauty and who speaks 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 teacher david for the channel is for 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
 copy and today we will continue with the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.140
 subject of numerous awards in the past 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 we learned to recognize a number 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.849
 incredible 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.230
 I promise to divide the same by 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 smaller numbers 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 today we will use it is a method that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.950
 It will encourage a little time is who 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 will do the enem or who does contest 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.020
 public or who does until proof in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.170
 otherwise no military college is good to use 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.809
 this method here because it is little is 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:56.870
 enough time to operate in Brazil. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.870
 number pm any number 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:11.760
 You know the first thing, it's good to take the root. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 feel square 101 does not have a root 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:21.720
 square exact it what I have here 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.150
 smaller number than entered is number 10 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 so I can state that it is more 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.970
 or less approaches 10 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 he is then that sentence and only sector 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.229
 I have an idea because I want this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:48.200
 information because I want to know the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:49.530
 profits in less than 10 being the 23 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.110
 37 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 so these are the numbers by the minors 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.380
 what you should be is if you had a rage 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 Exact for example are I could already 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 to say that it is not a is not the number 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.490
 worries 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.440
 then it is already through the first phase of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 to blush 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.980
 when he is not an exact queen 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.870
 it is not a square petacchi feel 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.860
 approximately 10 childhood in pay 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.840
 interest less than 10 what I'm going to do 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.560
 now I get this number in the center of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.380
 good level and good is ex 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.690
 ineligibility no one gets 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.560
 feeling here is divisible by these 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.690
 numbers 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:46.910
 so he's goulart sure he's from 1982 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.050
 he would have a number almost ending with 10 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.540
 246 of 8 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.770
 I do not remember determines everything so I can 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.120
 sign here did not give two good has passed 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.810
 for my second part of the first 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 phase 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 if it were Mayan in the attack given to affirm 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.100
 that he was not a job like he did not 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.040
 it's an exact root try the second step 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.810
 is always is divided by two 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.820
 not because it is not a model to exit 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:30.330
 and not two here I felt the finger for three 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:34.920
 goals or milestones we have the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.430
 I'll call the numbers do not know the most 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:47.400
 old and over 122 is not less than 3 of the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:54.170
 total square theme took shock 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.170
 let's continue here three minimum bet 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.600
 100ha leader is your book number 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.720
 because I know he has to finish 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.989
 they were the concepts he ends here 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.239
 with a unit of it is the 20 not always 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.239
 such collective also after the plenary 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:27.520
 You 're full in the name of nilson. 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:35.160
 here and last now 17 assimile 2007 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.110
 I'll get here, I'll stop until the unit. 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:46.690
 or multiply the units will have their 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:57.330
 fear will not stay in the 22 10 - bush 8 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:05:05.410
 was 17 8:17 I can not say that 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:09.070
 is not visible at 17 and bets that up 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:13.510
 Marquinhos felt it is not divisible 29 23 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:25.210
 million / 5 and neither for sex then this 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:28.780
 number 1 111 is personal beauty 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:33.160
 this method here makes it much easier 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.790
 it's fast I just need to know the root 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.220
 find approximate root identify in 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.830
 which picked numbers I will divide and 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.880
 feel and know of ceteb de 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.500
 visibility 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.500
 just this that geek
