North board wheels they're pretty good
for<00:00:32.789> sliding<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.359> I<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:34.140> rather<00:00:34.230> have

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
for sliding but I would rather have

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
for sliding but I would rather have
different<00:00:35.010> wheels<00:00:35.190> uh<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.160> came<00:00:38.339> with

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
good flexi born I really like it's not

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.450 
good flexi born I really like it's not
too<00:01:20.130> flexy<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.440> an<00:01:22.560> overall<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.190> like

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.530 
too flexy but it's an overall good like
free<00:01:23.820> ride<00:01:24.030> board<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.660> guess<00:01:25.130> um<00:01:26.360> good<00:01:27.360> for

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
free ride board I guess um good for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.940 
free ride board I guess um good for
downhill<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.080> carving<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.720> um<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.710> grip

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
downhill and carving and um the grip

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.180 
downhill and carving and um the grip
tape<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.730> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.360> fall<00:01:33.750> off<00:01:34.190> pretty

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
tape it can kind of like fall off pretty

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.150 
tape it can kind of like fall off pretty
easy<00:01:36.050> like<00:01:37.050> mine<00:01:37.230> has<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.590> fallen<00:01:37.830> off<00:01:38.130> yet

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
easy like mine has it fallen off yet

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.040 
easy like mine has it fallen off yet
like<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.760> kind<00:01:39.120> of<00:01:39.210> fell<00:01:39.390> off<00:01:39.420> around<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
like it kind of fell off around the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.510 
like it kind of fell off around the
screw<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.410> don't<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.010> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
screw I don't think you can see it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.890 
screw I don't think you can see it
because<00:01:41.730> I<00:01:41.850> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.180> fixed<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.780> right

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
because I kind of fixed it like right

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
because I kind of fixed it like right
there<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.610> don't<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.330> but

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
there I don't think you can see it but

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.340 
there I don't think you can see it but
I'm<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.440> like<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.680> pintail<00:01:47.160> pretty<00:01:47.580> much<00:01:48.350> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
I'm it's like a pintail pretty much but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.250 
I'm it's like a pintail pretty much but
it<00:01:49.500> cuts<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.660> that's<00:01:51.660> what<00:01:52.050> makes

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
it cuts off right here that's what makes

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.930 
it cuts off right here that's what makes
it<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.650> shorter<00:01:53.100> than<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> 40<00:01:53.940> inch<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
it a little shorter than the 40 inch and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.710 
it a little shorter than the 40 inch and
everything's<00:01:56.940> really<00:01:57.180> good<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
everything's really good about this

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.630 
everything's really good about this
board<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.260> has<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.690> little<00:02:01.640> concave

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
board and it has the little concave

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.840 
board and it has the little concave
thing<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:04.280> front<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.550> keeps<00:02:05.730> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
thing right here front and it keeps you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.130 
thing right here front and it keeps you
from<00:02:05.970> will<00:02:06.150> bite<00:02:06.330> because<00:02:06.510> these<00:02:06.720> trucks<00:02:07.020> are

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
from will bite because these trucks are

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
from will bite because these trucks are
pretty<00:02:07.350> Carvey<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
pretty Carvey and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.619 
pretty Carvey and
I<00:02:09.539> don't<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.629> down

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
I don't know if you can see right down

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.330 
I don't know if you can see right down
the<00:02:12.989> middle<00:02:13.019> as<00:02:14.239> pretty<00:02:15.239> good<00:02:15.540> concave<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.530> was

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the middle as pretty good concave I was

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
the middle as pretty good concave I was
like<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> baby<00:02:17.790> kick<00:02:18.090> tail<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.959> good<00:02:19.170> for

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
like a baby kick tail it's good for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.309 
like a baby kick tail it's good for
popping<00:02:20.340> all<00:02:20.489> these<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:21.060> shove<00:02:21.870> its<00:02:22.110> or

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
