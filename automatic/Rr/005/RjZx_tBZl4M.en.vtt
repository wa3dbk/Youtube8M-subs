00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:04.180
 Good evening is either 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.570
 I would like to introduce a pot 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.879
 It is called lavender 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.879
 First strike goal before 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.539
 16 pages often used but not sensing 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.589
 ToDay 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.650
 Both Essentials Two 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.989
 Reference 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.439
 Has accompanied three players 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.470
 Are the Top 10 Other Companies Still Different? 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.620
 It is local production for local consumption 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.800
 I think I'm getting into a slump 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 It's a very disappointing place to sniper this doll actually 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.490
 is not it 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.120
 First one side 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.690
 It's been a while 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 It's ellegarden 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.010
 race 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.790
 It is Kawasaki town, but 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.600
 Still a little high 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.980
 Seven or less places are decided 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 But such 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 It is full of the photograph 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.480
 It is lavender 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.380
 Of the temple 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.810
 There is a natural difference 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.240
 Already in Japan 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.820
 Lavender 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480
 What are the other three things 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.560
 Something completely different 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.080
 By all means once 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.160
 Of the temple 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.860
 lavender 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 I want you to come by 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.730
 If you are in Osaka 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.219
 Osaka Tenmangu 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.760
 In the planning people center 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.200
 Every Wednesday 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.820
 I think that I will offer after night 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.060
 There is also a time to rest 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.390
 Taipei from 7 am to 9 pm every Wednesday night 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.960
 Because I live near 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.510
 Because it is a seminar 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.450
 You can wake up the operating time of the authoring 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 Though 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.039
 It is a solid tailor 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.319
 I have a nursing care certification break 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 It is lonely 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.839
 1432 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.459
 I thought you started using it 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.419
 m interchange 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 Essential treatment 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.249
 When that happens 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.709
 This store is this 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.979
 Just read Li 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.409
 Okamoto 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.529
 Until then 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.710
 Yes that person was used to 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.599
 There are many others 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599
 Confirmation was late, but what is this about it 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.109
 Immediately 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.169
 It is in the middle of the US 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.969
 And flew to America 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.839
 Take a job, for example 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.259
 Both are reverse Mano 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.539
 Sold with 2319 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.709
 Over time before I say something 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.459
 Show smile when going through rebuilding 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.459
 About 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.689
 And in that we come once a month 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.239
 It is from a veteran person 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.459
 Because people 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.019
 That billion dollar absorption 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 It is a pin 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.099
 I understood the other day 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.119
 Though 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.710
 Fukaya green onion requirements 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.449
 It's totally different 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.669
 Together 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.139
 Not only that 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.949
 Actually 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.029
 It is double of last year 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.569
 Current 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.669
 I'm coming back at the office and stare at it 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.329
 No need for the right bank 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.249
 Enchant 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.729
 It may be an application 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:00.779
 Just 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.580
 Try making full use of the fork 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.949
 Yasuke Kensuke 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.949
 That we need bamboo 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.609
 Though it is lavender and how to use 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.350
 I think it's a granddaughter but I'm sending it 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.709
 thing 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.169
 Why Renew 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.880
 Half body bath or offensive odor closed 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.749
 It is said that the chest 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.020
 It is in the 40th place of strength 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.849
 Alive 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.099
 Either goal first goal 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.449
 I could do it in 4 ways ... 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.499
 complexion 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.890
 Many books 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.939
 Endo Aoi 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.939
 I also indicate the sympathetic area 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.699
 It is a relaxing effect 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.759
 In terms of relaxation 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.949
 But 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.509
 As it is said 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.949
 It is by convenience 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.949
 Standard sleep well 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.370
 Ryosuke Horii 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.779
 1422 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.469
 It is not eight times 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.469
 With Narnia switch 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:26.979
 However 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.169
 In a big corner of a street corner, I will not go soon 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.509
 I can not 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.509
 It looks like it was burned red 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.749
 lavender 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.520
 Besides 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.689
 Open to god 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:48.579
 in use
