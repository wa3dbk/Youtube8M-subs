00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.429
 her friends 120 channels welcome again 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 once again with Adriano Panzironi 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 the author of the book is 120 years old 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 truth that nobody wants to tell you and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.520
 today we will talk about water of importance 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 of the water than you assume and i 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.350
 what kind maybe well then everyone is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 agree that you must drink at least two 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.510
 at least he says water 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.330
 the medicine 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.390
 what does Signor Panzironi say? I say that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.670
 this very long root on how the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 medicine decides to face the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.820
 health problem 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 so let's start right away 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.250
 quite light because it is not a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 advice to give this before saying 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.789
 if good advice would at least be necessary 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 reasoning why they give us this 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.530
 the advice I ask a question the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.379
 wild animals animals in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 kindly they have to reluctantly say when 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 they do not have the stimulus of thirst 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.230
 the primitive man imagines it in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.120
 ride with a bottle because so 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 when thirsty or when he didn't 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 thirsty could drink quietly 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.990
 and instead official medicine tells us 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.360
 to drink to drink a lot and good also 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 when we don't always have good in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.890
 effects I had not thought of it but then 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 because they advise us when we eat 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.009
 of the salty food inevitably comes to us 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.659
 to drink because our body must 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 remove the salt we ate 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.380
 in excess 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.860
 when we are in the sun or an area 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.750
 warm our water then evaporates us 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.939
 we are dehydrated and must drink 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 this is called the thirst stimulus the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.750
 our body is able to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.460
 tell us your needs can with 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 various stimuli then the last of the series 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 your site I estimate to eat to sleep 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 to pee, etc. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040
 but official medicine tells us of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.640
 drink even when we don't hear this 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.170
 stimulus seems to understand that if not 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 we have the stimulus of thirst and not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.759
 we should drink 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.409
 in theory, we shouldn't drink in theory 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.270
 without the stimulus of thirst 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.460
 but I tell you that this advice is there 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.789
 will give official medicine actually a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.060
 good advice but it is good advice 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.520
 precisely because modern nutrition 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 the problem forces us to give more 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.739
 that what we eat does not stimulate 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.690
 our thirst so we don't have it 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.900
 urge to drink and tell us to do it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 just to help our body ad 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.080
 assimilate these foods 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.720
 can you better explain this concept 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.430
 but we know that when we eat 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.459
 what he predicted that born from 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.110
 Milan and 60 70 percent of the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.030
 introduced calories are in the form of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.940
 sugars we know we introduce 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.890
 sugars in our intestines we activate 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.360
 a hormone that insulin well 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 insulin as we have said a lot 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.709
 of times to force the cells to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 going to sugar needs two 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.410
 elements of salt and water not a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.780
 case when eating food immediately 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.269
 we have a water retention effect 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 well if we do not drink since it is not 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.370
 we have the stimulus of the seat we have 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.920
 problems of the absence of water and second 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.360
 her if our body is not enough to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.880
 where he goes to get it 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.880
 well i guess from urine from feces 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.100
 exact is one of these reasons why there 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.530
 they say they drink water and fix it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.940
 the problem of constipation 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.260
 on the contrary if we don't eat anymore 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.030
 these foods cilic weapons of 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.410
 sugar but back to eating meat 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.299
 fish, fruit and vegetables 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.829
 we will see another phenomenon later 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.910
 about a week we don't eat anymore 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.370
 these foods 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.500
 we will go back to making so many very clear peppers 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.880
 and sometimes we will wonder why it was all 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.890
 this water simply ours 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.900
 people are releasing because it is no longer 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.209
 retained by the action of insulin well 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.160
 this surely must be tried though 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.410
 at this point I ask you what kind of 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.049
 water drink because the medicine is concordant 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.639
 in advising that you must drink water and 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.590
 low in sodium and mineral salts 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.209
 from here there is really fun because 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.280
 marketing has really focused 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.109
 on highlighting precisely the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.090
 brands of those waters that do not have 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.040
 minerals have very few if 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.180
 let's imagine the very lucky campaigns 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.459
 like that of the sodium particle 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.940
 that only in the bottle or water 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.650
 that eliminates the obvious water that the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.470
 those are the best-selling brands 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.170
 a bit of mineral salts and it seems to be 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.940
 a positive thing for water instead 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.260
 I ask you a question that perhaps makes us 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.880
 understand that this is not the case 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.920
 in your opinion what is the simplest way 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.470
 and more efficient for our body than 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.950
 take the mineral salts 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.110
 well I guess with the power we say 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.660
 introducing them with water because in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.220
 our supply of mineral salts 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.830
 in fact they are bound to proteins to 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.870
 fibers and then mineral salts bound to 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.190
 food is less assimilable than not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.270
 those in the water 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.610
 obviously when we drink 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.680
 water mineral salts are dissolved 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.960
 in it is therefore more easily enters 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.910
 in the bloodstream and then imagine 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.010
 in short, in the past, not animals or 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.550
 still today animals have to 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.640
 puddles 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.310
 primitive man certainly drank gods 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.510
 Lakes of the rivers did not go looking for the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.850
 pure source no 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.070
 certainly then he said so surely not 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.840
 makes a turn, however, Signor Panzironi 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.350
 ahi ahi ahi and he hasn't answered me yet 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.730
 that is, which water to prefer in drinking 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.230
 certainly enough water 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.030
 natural for the simple fact that 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.860
 the effect of efficiencies is given 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.330
 just from mineral salts present 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.880
 inside we know the waters 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.560
 effervescent are four volcanic 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.150
 therefore these springs pass 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.730
 through volcanic rocks and 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.620
 release many mineral salts 2 salts 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.270
 Fundamental minerals are calcium which 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.800
 we know it is used in ours 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.810
 own for buffer control system 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.670
 acidosis but also bicarbonate the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.020
 baking soda and the element itself 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.460
 perfect to stop the system ie 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.170
 improve the basic acid system 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.270
 well surely with this one 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.880
 affirmation there will be many 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.800
 controversy however we go ahead indeed 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.810
 I greet you, Signor Panzironi, to be 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.450
 here you too have been greeted 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.840
