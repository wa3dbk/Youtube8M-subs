00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.460
 the same 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.090
 Color roses is very easy 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.130
 to decorate any corner of 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.390
 or whatever combination you can think of we 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.829
 to see the tutorial to do our 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.790
 colorful flowers we will need 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.250
 newspaper coloring scissors can be 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.020
 in liquid like these powder like 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 which are to make water taste or 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 you can also use watercolors water 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 a brush 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 glue 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 pieces of unicel or cardboard can be 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 some ovation dish was chabled or 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.860
 you can use a cover of a box 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860
 paperboard 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.179
 and our optional materials are 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.609
 thin wire for the stem of the rose 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.019
 and some bottle or jar if you want to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.019
 put them in vase mode 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.930
 let's start let's take our 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.150
 newspaper and let's draw a spiral 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.530
 you do not need to stay super good 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 done so do not worry 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.700
 and at the end of the spiral we draw a 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.680
 peak 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.960
 now the spiral does not have to stay 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.479
 perfect but if you take care that the distance 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.310
 between lines is more or less the same and 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.700
 we cut following the line of 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.700
 spiral 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 once trimmed well in the fun 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.430
 let's take a cap or surface 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.770
 to mix the water and the brush and for 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.870
 course our dyes the rose that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.930
 I will be a beautiful blue green and 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.000
 so I will need these two colors 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:11.730
 we put some drops of dye we wet 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.710
 the brush and we mix the color will be done 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.910
 the clearer the more water we throw at it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.220
 that takes this into account to do 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.080
 gradrados, very good, I recommend you 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.270
 that you put a greater concentration of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.490
 color at the peak of the spiral because 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.020
 that will be the center of our rose and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.120
 also a little on the banks for 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.120
 give you that effect of lights and shadows 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.170
 then we take a napkin and with 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.880
 Carefully press on the spiral 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.380
 so that it absorbs the excess water and 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.380
 dry much faster 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.880
 do not worry if the color you chose 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.950
 it looks very dark or grayish when I know 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.989
 that will look much better we will 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.460
 take it off very carefully and put it 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.740
 in the sun to dry really fast 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.480
 When it is completely dry you will see that 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.530
 the color became clearer and it is 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 time to put together our flower 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.450
 let's take the spiral peak and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.370
 bend it towards the center 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.170
 then we go back to making a small 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.470
 fold in the same direction and 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.660
 we started to roll 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.340
 while we wind we go pressing a 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.620
 little by the bottom in the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.600
 first 5 laps after that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.300
 we roll up normal and little by little we go 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.010
 releasing the newspaper is to say that 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:48.820
 being weaker as soon as 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:50.500
 we advance when everything is rolled 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.600
 let's press against the surface 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.370
 where we are working and to fold a 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.170
 little the edges outward so that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.170
 look more like a rose 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.170
 two 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.769
 then we will remember a small 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.840
 Unicel circle or cardboard depends on 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.670
 what you have chosen to be more or less 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.129
 of the size that the rose occupies by the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.169
 bottom and before we stick 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:24.190
 to cut that little tail that we had left 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:26.169
 roll now if we put glue and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.690
 we paste pressing very carefully 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.880
 so as not to deform it and leaving that part 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.870
 of the free spiral because it's with that 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.870
 we will cover the unicel 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:46.249
 and that's how easy it is to have your rose 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.469
 newspaper now if you want to put it type 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.479
 single vase we cut a piece of 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:52.279
 wire of the size that you want what 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.349
 insert from the bottom and 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.889
 we put some glue so that it does not 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.889
 come out 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.929
 they look super flirty anywhere 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:08.669
 You can even thread them in a candle 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:10.859
 and give that romantic and feminine touch 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.989
 your space or as a beautiful decoration 

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:14.989
 of tables of some important party 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.889
 already liked it and if you liked it and 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.440
 share it with the indicative so that 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.210
 put more health and talking about things 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.250
 good wave I want to recommend you with the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.470
 good esteem series that is called me here 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.840
 where I appear and am a person 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.759
 very very talkative that throws all of 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.910
 head so if you want to take a 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.380
 look give it to comment subscribe you 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:51.759
