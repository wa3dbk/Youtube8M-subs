00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.710
 welcome to pellages of a world of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.710
 watchmaking 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.949
 we have the swatch brand which is still 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.000
 the first brand in unit and that is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.430
 left in this group to which we 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 belong who introduced the head 0-1 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 one with for beach volleyball which 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.179
 will come with other products so he 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.130
 is true that in some areas these 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.840
 connected products will offer a lot 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 of conviviality or ease 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 but let's be so realistic a brand like 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 who for the second year to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 pass the milestone of 4 million watches 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.510
 over 4 million over 4 million 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 exported watches 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.110
 unfortunately still the attitude that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 we will market the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.570
 touch technology united to 16 years in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 1999 represents only 2 5% of the units 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.190
 I can introduce you to another head 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.559
 tissot titeuf tactile connected quebec 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 that have low to me to reread with the ebikon 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 beacons share beautiful beacons and we 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 have made an agreement with the alpine club 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 Switzerland or Switzerland where there were 160 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.640
 hut of cabins where we go 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 equip by the end of the year 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.659
 80 of these cabins with the tag that is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 a solar beacon so actually 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.240
 by your energy problem and / or with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.159
 solar tubes connected here you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 when you arrive in the cabin you 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 can see to see your watch have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.840
 the real the tibet tri have the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.860
 temperature hygrometry and that's 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.540
 Swiss mechanical watchmaking at exists 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.850
 for more than 400 euros and I think 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.829
 that it will still exist in the future 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 and the least connected is more a 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.180
 today's technology that can 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
 become obsolete in five years ago 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 still a lot wrist that have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.119
 no shows today and maybe 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.460
 that these connected worlds also objects 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.409
 connected oro go on new ones 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.820
 wrist that one day these new wrist 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.770
 we are used to wearing something 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 for them too suddenly this Sunday 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.119
 I wish I could wear a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.610
 pair of mechanical Swiss show on 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.680
 think why not a day to have 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 connectivity to another 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 yes but that could be imagined on 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.920
 a bracelet for example there is no need 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.210
 that is necessarily the promo shows 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 talk they are connected but a 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.460
 arm is that they can give 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 some information 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.870
 we want a win new customers and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.750
 not to lose one who would like 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.820
 that would mean ah I buy myself over the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.520
 tag heuer I buy myself a connected if 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.300
 we had the best android language 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.900
 and if we had the best engine 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.900
 intel microprocessors we would have everything 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.140
 the aptitude people attitude to make a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 connected mode that could be at the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.630
 apple's legal limit but she can 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 to be less good, ie less 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.940
 much less two months of application 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.220
 so we are able to make a 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 very simple connected watch that you 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.250
 would give for example that your beats 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.810
 of heart the number of hours that you 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.400
 have slept 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.660
 the number of steps you have made 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.350
 opening your fridge or 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.739
 opening your house or car 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.930
 and we could also do the watch 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.010
 exactly how apple since we 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.080
 have the same skill we 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.150
 we can not do anything 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.280
 have a partnership because the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.680
 competence in high technology 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.330
 we did not have it we left the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.830
 principle that the watch remains the master 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.750
 we do not want to put a bad 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.000
 phone on the wrist because we see the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.130
 surface available on a watch these 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.200
 camps is relatively small you have 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.530
 two pushers a crown when all 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.480
 okay 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.040
 if you have a chronograph on the other hand 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.860
 you do not have that friendliness that we have 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.170
 on the phone is for that 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.200
 we use the phone as 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.840
 help to improve usability 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.280
 of fashion use if you run 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.750
 four times around you 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.799
 district 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.780
 so there the times that I come from 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.670
 take are directly downloaded 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.260
 on the phone because that's for sure 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.750
 speaks of the Swiss born of whom speaks of this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.459
 reinforcing the ordonance of 70 2 that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's good to do it but I 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.940
 think that's enough is not enough 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.459
 also retain its capabilities 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.230
 innovation in Switzerland by keeping everything 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.640
 what can be done in Switzerland and in 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.430
 developing to have this shot before 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.210
 what is at the level of innovation I 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.640
 think maybe not the only one 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.750
 but one of the key success factors of 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.870
 our Swiss watch industry 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.170
 so we have a lot of features 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.620
 already in the watch and after we have them 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.790
 connections with weapons with 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.550
 graphics the story the coaching that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.750
 is all the added functions but 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.690
 added to a beautiful a beautiful product not 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.590
 backwards and that's very important 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:48.440
 our fundamental philosophy 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.230
 different offices notice 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.710
 the web is full of silicon valley on 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.500
 now it's perfect for the 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.270
 phone actually the watch is 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.710
 independent the phone is diagonal 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.740
 therefore magnesium 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.090
 it's both precise like the 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.410
 most beautiful Swiss mechanics since 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.660
 in fact it's a mechanical watch and 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.160
 soon it contains micro cheap and a 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.140
 antenna which are a key actually encrypted 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.770
 so for every individual who buy 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.510
 the watch there is an encrypted code of nature 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.620
 military in terms of security so we 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.380
 is really in very high levels 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.660
 security that is going to be an access key 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.430
 to all the data of the environment 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.860
 user's home 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.660
 it can be in your car 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.950
 without your key it can be in 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.540
 your apartment it can be between a 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.570
 other bank account that can be 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.600
 find your access codes for a 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.370
 map of frequent flyers so when 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.440
 it works it's very simple we have 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.160
 worked with the leading Swiss company 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.750
 worldwide in the field of 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.110
 data the digital which is called wise 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.560
 iquique based in Geneva wazi that has 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.620
 equipped with data and systems of 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.480
 creep sion or not craypion who are 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.660
 deemed the safest in the world in the 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.070
 best capitalized box in the world a 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.750
 box that has a network rites and the 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.990
 outstanding a mark that is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.880
 extremely notorious called apple 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.580
 who returns with his big hooves and his 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.550
 means in a market that is the market 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.600
 of watchmaking and compared to that I 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.020
 think it's creating a 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.490
 climate of stress that makes that all 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.270
 world has to position itself a bit in the 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.310
 precipitation 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.660
 not always with concrete products 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.850
 which are ready to be marketed 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.220
 but it needed a reaction and a 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.870
 well shown that this reaction she 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.890
 begins to take place today at the 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.480
 good news for Swiss watchmaking 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.910
 is that segments of less than 1000 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.320
 francs represent a small part 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.320
 of the watchmaking industry 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.780
 Swiss and that thanks to that makes it the 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.550
 level of impact exposure of 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.100
 smartwatch should remain rather 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.840
 limited three years horizon and to a 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.120
 moment everyone will not want 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.950
 wear a smartwatch everyone does not 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.780
 will not want to wear the apple smartwatch 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.520
 and we actually saw in history 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.060
 marks only when a brand that 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.650
 arrive at 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.120
 missioned actually into dominant brands 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.610
 it also leaves a place extremely 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.870
 important for challengers and we 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.490
 suggest that the market for 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.770
 smartwatch will be dominated by 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.030
 American actors like apple but 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.169
 that there are actually segments of 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.910
 market especially in the high end 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.139
 on which Switzerland has not only a 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.440
 playing card but also a business to 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.440
 preserve
