 very good to everyone today how to do 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.970
 this a new video tutorial of 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.400
 photoshop in which I will teach you how to create 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.759
 a 3d text like that of minecraft a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.199
 user request and nothing first 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.359
 what we have to do is give him file 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.069
 new as always we select the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 size we want for example thousand per 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.000
 thousand 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 we double click on the background 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 we select the frame tool 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.800
 rectangular and we eliminate what is the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.829
 fund if we do not want to put a fund of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.249
 she specific 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:43.300
 we select a letter for example from 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:43.300
 green color a little darker 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.840
 and select a text tool 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.070
 this specific source of minecraft that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.470
 now leave in the description so that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 you can download the selected the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.030
 area where we want to write we put 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 skewer example 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.150
 we increase the size a little 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.370
 with the mouse wheel 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.880
 for example 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.770
 we center it a bit 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.149
 we can even increase the canvas 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.710
 increasing the width for example to 50 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.090
 centimeters so we have more 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.170
 space to work 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.149
 and once here let's say we'll double 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.340
 the layer giving the right button to 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.550
 duplicate layer or by pressing the control 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.640
 j 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.220
 we will always download the copy 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.470
 the original up above 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.860
 copy and the next thing we will do is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.450
 select the copy 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.530
 and with the arrows on the keyboard go down 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 said copy until as you see here it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.890
 see the transparent holes 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 and we just have to give it to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.130
 up again until we plug right 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.190
 the transparent gap that is above 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.020
 here you see how they are already superimposed 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.530
 we select the layer again 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.050
 main we give the right button 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:21.030
 fusion options 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 and we will select for example a stroke 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.590
 of 3 pixel in size we will select 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.180
 color overlay by selecting on 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.850
 the color we want for example 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.520
 this 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:42.080
 that resembles pretty much what it is 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.760
 the title of the minecraft we give to ok and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.630
 to the copy we give the right button 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.820
 fusion options 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.910
 we give the stroke three pixels too 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.200
 colors overlay 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.560
 we put a darker tone 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.069
 something like that we give ok and already more or less 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.530
 we have let's say the text in 3-d with the 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.890
 way that we wanted that is the one that is of 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.450
 title of the game's minecraft 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.690
 next thing we have to do is 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.840
 select the two layers with control 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.360
 we give the right button raster hoist 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.210
 text 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.370
 we give the right button again 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.110
 we combine the layers 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.740
 and once this is done we will give you the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.740
 edit edition 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.740
 perspective 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.060
 and here we will play say on the axes 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.090
 horizontal here 3 horizontal and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.180
 vertical putting values ​​for example 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.060
 5 so that as you see here you can see a little 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.890
 more inclined 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.270
 if you want him to lean towards the other 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.880
 side you have to put minus 5 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.210
 and playing with this concretely with the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.440
 title of minecraft 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.870
 is around 45 or so we give to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.030
 intro and apply and we already have our 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.890
 title ready for our miniatures 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.080
 our works or everything that you 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.540
 want to use these techniques the 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.920
 you can use with other sources not with 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.500
 all because there are some that do not 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.389
 lets let's say do this kind of 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.030
 3d effect 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.280
 but well all the letters let's say 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.349
 they are so a little wide and showy is 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.659
 pretty easy to do as 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.729
 you have seen and I do not expect anything that has 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.249
