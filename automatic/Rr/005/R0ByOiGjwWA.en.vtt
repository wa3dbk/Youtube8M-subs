00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.860
 we will start by demonstrating how 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.510
 a cartridge works like that 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.180
 print here I have a template 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.520
 the hp cartridge we really go 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 do all the training based on the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.020
 hp cartridges is where the procedure 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.119
 recharge is people apply to 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.640
 virtually all cartridges 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.820
 other brands models and glue 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.750
 well here we have 93 which is a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.050
 hp colorful cartridge used very 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.710
 multifunction 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.500
 these models practically 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.899
 I will demonstrate how the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 cartridges print the people first 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.040
 there are some parts within the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.320
 cartridge that results in 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.690
 ink compartments 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.680
 in case of the color is three of the black is 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.520
 only one agent has the lid part of the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.229
 crato the use of cartridge head body 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.329
 that this metal plate and the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.249
 circuit it makes the contact of the 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.249
 with the print head 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.709
 the procedure it takes to make 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.859
 the print is the drip of the 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:29.049
 particles of fifth it happens with the 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.749
 overheating a particle here 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.060
 in the printhead which is where 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.880
 shipped fifth down on the sheet 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.639
 in this case what happens when people 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.279
 speaks very much that for example it is d'oxum 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.200
 who dies when the cartridge burns 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:47.799
 there is a great possibility of having 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.840
 the print head is missing , and the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.240
 that happens to the resistance heats up and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 as it has no liquid or in case the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.910
 fifth for what it is practically 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.280
 manages that part of the resistance she comes 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.230
 break the electric circuit 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.210
 if it breaks one or more frequently 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.410
 electrical power it may even accuse the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.990
 cartridge and many of the cases are 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 due to customers using the fifth 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.130
 she talks a lot and she starts to talk 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.350
 burn a part of the printed circuit 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.890
 here that can not be seen 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.030
 naked eye only with a microscope am 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.340
 inside the cartridge 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.050
 we have a screen that is inside 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.860
 a metal screen 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.280
 this metal screen protects the head 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.620
 and pressure against debris leaving the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.700
 sponge or ink because it begins to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.520
 stay in school 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 if these debris from the sponge descends 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.380
 up to the head impression she goes 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 go through a maze below here 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.160
 She will happen what she will clog. 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.220
 the cartridge then whenever people 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.410
 do the recharging is good at once not 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.330
 calculate this screen 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.810
 I'll explain further ahead in 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.489
 Virtual demonstrated how a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.170
 cartridge is I'm going to explain the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.860
 care that we must have at the time of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.100
 handle it first never touch the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.750
 hand on the printed circuit board 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.910
 What happens is that we have the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.100
 static electricity in practically 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.000
 all objects and especially the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.890
 our body 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.370
 we have a great disadvantage 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.980
 also in the hand there are sweat and this 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.720
 sweat in contact with this circuit he 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.269
 it may come to damage driving 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.489
 electricity from one point to another until 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.750
 that he if he clothes some circuit in the part 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.269
 printhead 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.390
 the sweat problem in his hand he too 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.070
 can cause is corrosion between the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.010
 contacts mainly for people who 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.150
 have too much uric acid 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.030
 so we always have to take a lot 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.450
 careful handling will never go back to hand 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.850
 Direct here always was to get a customer 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.460
 never catch up with him in the contact 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.710
 the customer will always see and will come and 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.470
 putting your hand like this and it 's always good 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.090
 correct the customer of this problem in order to 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.360
 to avoid the problem for us also in the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.980
 no one wants to deny it next time it's 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.160
 be very careful with cartridges as well. 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.530
 that never gets dirty this cover is always 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.230
 that this already keep it very clean the cante 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.540
 always likes to see the cartridge clean 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.400
 like it was original it does not understand 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.620
 in fact we opened the cartridge 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.470
 and do a recharge in here 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 he thinks we're just putting on a 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.800
 magic machine and nothing happens 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.200
 only in court 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.540
 so keep the car sound always clean 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.140
 Nothing scratching 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.000
 nothing Stiletto brand is and always 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.260
 this part of the head pressure clean 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.440
 because when you know I want to have 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.470
 Used it will have lots of markings 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.570
 of ink in that part here usually he 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.610
 comes this way very dirty as can 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.800
 be showing a video 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.790
 we have to take some measures of 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 clean it 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.960
 and a very fundamental detail never 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.990
 let this happen that is 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.960
 happening to me in this case a video 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.300
 class I'm showing her without the glove is 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.090
 more a professional to recharge and never 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.280
 may appear with a dirty hand 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.290
 he is always with the white hand that 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.780
 it is also a way of not showing 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.690
 customer and the recharge made a manual and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.370
 using a camera then whenever the 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.590
 people to handle a cartridge takes 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.320
 very careful and the first was the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.260
 first step is to wear gloves equal to 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.500
 company in the kit gloves are cheap 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.210
 they are disposable but you can 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.450
 reuse them a couple of times 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.250
 so always wear gloves no problem 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.180
 which will take a waste of 20 or 30 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.510
 cents per refill but we have to use 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.510
 The streets
