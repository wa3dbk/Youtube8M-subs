 I had a clear program and as I do not like 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.280
 I got a chance sea and you 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.630
 first television experience as 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.820
 was how did you get all the television 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.930
 because I studied classical dance when 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 girl and then this one my teacher was me 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.369
 already lombardini and I already had a program 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.619
 child who was called my little friends 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.990
 with me and I talk and then he took me to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:39.140
 to do a ballet at 7 years old and then there 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.430
 this one needed was the producer not 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.300
 I know what they needed to do 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.409
 commercial about a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.229
 an intimate demarcation clothing 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:53.210
 there is no marcelita and then if 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.210
 well they called me says and I started 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.460
 on channel 8 I made a novel with rené 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:07.739
 muñoz 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:10.750
 which is san martín in itself little 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:19.060
 but I retired many years ago by 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.640
 supposedly many years because this first 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.920
 I always had the big desire to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.810
 study 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.000
 and then I said good if I continue in the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 television is going to be very difficult for me 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 can have a stable life in question 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.770
 of couples with joselo because it's a 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.560
 I work very 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.080
 very demanding one leaves very late at night 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.540
 then I prefer to have a couple have 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 a stable relationship with joselo and he 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 gave the opportunity I wanted to study and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.900
 see if I would like to study 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.550
 I'm going to dedicate my son could do 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.560
 many things student right of 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.120
 university in santa mayor reason took 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.430
 life and then I did two graduate 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.960
 criminology and penitential law and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.520
 after that it's like the tailor already in the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.980
 world of law that you got into your 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.350
 profession you do not miss you television 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.240
 not for nothing the truth 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.150
 I see sometimes actresses actors that if 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.250
 Not that this worm was never dies 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 it will be that according to zenith never you will not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.750
 I know I do not know but I never miss it 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.110
 they called me and they offered me this job 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.570
 but no 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.060
 television before television 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.550
 From now 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.700
 good look now there's talent there 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.099
 many talents I see young actresses 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.930
 good and very good young actors very 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.550
 good but undoubtedly that the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.290
 television from before like they had a 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.140
 very special magic that I do not have 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.569
 right now I do not know unforgettable actresses like 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.940
 doris wells marina baura 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.700
 Ivan Moreno were wonderful actresses 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.550
 the earlier novels were based on the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.350
 love then came the time of the crisis of 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.850
 the social criticism that was also very 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.010
 good and right now 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.020
 I sometimes see some novels for 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.610
 see the actors and the actresses 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.340
 There seems to be a lot of talent too 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.100
 right now 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.280
 another time another time other topics the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.980
 pink novel that in which are the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.720
 mexican 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:29.410
 that of the fia but I always made 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.990
 bad and then good if you do one thing 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.520
 morgan is called the devil and the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.050
 possessed that she was a little witch 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.210
 I only starred 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.490
 two or three novels I do not remember in the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.280
 cinema that if I made two sacred films 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.530
 of characters that exists to interpret 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.530
 identify topics on television 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.389
 with sweet Maria who was a dancer 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.009
 classic that was paralyzed after 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.009
 an accident 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.999
 and it was bad too it was not anymore 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.499
 It was not bad but it was frustrated bitter 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.529
 I had a lot of complex because imagine 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:09.089
 a classic dancer who remains in a 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.610
 accident and is in a wheelchair 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.300
 the frustration was very great but not 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.300
 they were bad 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.560
 yes, of course 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:26.560

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.930
 It was the day you saw it for the first time 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.060

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.070
 You were for a strong author and some 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.710
 grace that is 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.710

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.120

 I had worked in television for 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.930
 joselo 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.780
 but for me it was Mr. Jose what 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.390
 they created 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.820

 total that after I found it in 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.229
 venevision 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.220
 once I went up and I was already recording 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.860
