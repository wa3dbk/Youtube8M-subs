we're going to talk about today which is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
we're going to talk about today which is
squad<00:00:58.559> sizes<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> squad<00:00:59.750> specializations

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
squad sizes and squad specializations

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540

and<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.350> am<00:01:01.469> playing<00:01:01.710> by<00:01:01.890> myself<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.340> already

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and i am playing by myself i already

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
and i am playing by myself i already
mentioned<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
mentioned that and it's actually kind of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870 
mentioned that and it's actually kind of
tough<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.589> play<00:01:04.739> battlefield<00:01:05.189> 3<00:01:05.339> by<00:01:05.489> yourself

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
tough to play battlefield 3 by yourself

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
tough to play battlefield 3 by yourself
but<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.330> impossible<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
but it's not impossible but one of the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
but it's not impossible but one of the
problems<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.090> play<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
problems when you do play with a lot of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
problems when you do play with a lot of
friends<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> squad<00:01:10.860> sizes<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.939> squad

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
friends is the squad sizes now the squad

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
friends is the squad sizes now the squad
sizes<00:01:12.689> makes<00:01:12.900> sense<00:01:13.140> battlefield<00:01:13.710> 3<00:01:13.950> was

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sizes makes sense battlefield 3 was

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
sizes makes sense battlefield 3 was
built<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> ground<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.299> four

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
built from the ground up with four

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
built from the ground up with four
people<00:01:15.810> per<00:01:15.990> squad<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.590> classes<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.490> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
people per squad for classes you know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
people per squad for classes you know
each<00:01:17.820> person<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.240> play<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> classes

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
each person can play one of the classes

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.740 
each person can play one of the classes
it<00:01:19.500> makes<00:01:19.740> sense<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> but

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it makes sense if you think about it but

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
it makes sense if you think about it but
my<00:01:21.869> problem<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:22.920> always<00:01:23.250> played

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
my problem is is I've always played

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
my problem is is I've always played
battlefield<00:01:24.030> games<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> battlefield<00:01:25.350> used

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
battlefield games and battlefield used

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
battlefield games and battlefield used
to<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> six<00:01:26.520> man<00:01:26.700> squads<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.689> really

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to have six man squads and I was really

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
to have six man squads and I was really
used<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> six<00:01:28.650> man<00:01:28.829> squads<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
used to six man squads it's really

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
used to six man squads it's really
frustrating<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.630> you've<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.900> multiple

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
frustrating when you've got multiple

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
frustrating when you've got multiple
people<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.549> game<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
people in the game with you to have to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
people in the game with you to have to
break<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.560> separate<00:01:34.890> squads

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
break up into into separate squads

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.469 
break up into into separate squads
because<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.729> hurts<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.240> flow<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
because that really hurts the flow of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
because that really hurts the flow of
the<00:01:36.630> game<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.710> started<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the game and I started to think about it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
the game and I started to think about it
I<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> originally<00:01:39.600> wanted<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I when I originally wanted to do this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
I when I originally wanted to do this
video<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> talk<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.189> squad<00:01:41.549> size<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.939> i<00:01:42.030> was

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
video and talk about squad size as i was

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
video and talk about squad size as i was
going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> corner<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.290> hey<00:01:43.500> why

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
going to be on the corner like hey why

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.340 
going to be on the corner like hey why
don't<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:45.030> increase<00:01:45.420> squad<00:01:45.990> sizes

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
don't we actually increase squad sizes

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
don't we actually increase squad sizes
back<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.680> six<00:01:46.950> wouldn't<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.640> make<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
back to six wouldn't that make a lot a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
back to six wouldn't that make a lot a
lot<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.570> sense<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.930> mean<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> would<00:01:49.320> it'll<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
lot of sense i mean it would it'll it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.139 
lot of sense i mean it would it'll it
would<00:01:50.009> allow<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.430> people<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.759> play<00:01:51.000> together

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
would allow more people to play together

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.139 
would allow more people to play together
because<00:01:52.049> multiplayer<00:01:52.439> games<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:52.979> about

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
because multiplayer games are all about

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
because multiplayer games are all about
you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> social<00:01:54.720> interaction<00:01:55.259> playing

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you know the social interaction playing

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.499 
you know the social interaction playing
with<00:01:55.680> friends<00:01:55.829> having<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.640> time<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
with friends having a good time but the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
with friends having a good time but the
more<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> thought<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> realize

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
more I thought about the more I realize

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.080 
more I thought about the more I realize
you<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.729> create<00:02:00.000> more

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you know that would just create more

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
you know that would just create more
problems<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> way<00:02:01.229> battlefield<00:02:01.710> 3<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
problems and the way battlefield 3 is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
problems and the way battlefield 3 is
actually<00:02:02.130> set<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.880> can't<00:02:03.390> imagine

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
actually set up I can't imagine

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.270 
actually set up I can't imagine
battlefield<00:02:04.259> 4<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.100> much

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
battlefield 4 would be that much

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
battlefield 4 would be that much
different<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.790> six<00:02:06.180> man<00:02:06.360> squads<00:02:06.750> work<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
different that six man squads work that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
different that six man squads work that
well<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.160> reason<00:02:08.310> behind<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.910> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
well and the reason behind that is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.089 
well and the reason behind that is
because<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> medic<00:02:10.500> mechanics

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
because of the way the medic mechanics

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.500 
because of the way the medic mechanics
work<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> actually<00:02:12.090> change

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
work they would have to actually change

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
work they would have to actually change
that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
that
because<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.740> got<00:02:13.890> six<00:02:14.190> people<00:02:14.370> spawning

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
because if you got six people spawning

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.790 
because if you got six people spawning
on<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.630> well<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> guess<00:02:16.170> five<00:02:16.440> people

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
on you know well I guess five people

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.470 
on you know well I guess five people
could<00:02:16.950> potentially<00:02:17.430> spawn<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.060> person

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
could potentially spawn on one person

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
could potentially spawn on one person
that's<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.260> pretty<00:02:19.440> big<00:02:19.620> deal<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.040> would

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that's a pretty big deal that would

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's a pretty big deal that would
change<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> lot<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.240> these<00:02:21.330> maps<00:02:21.600> play

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
change the way a lot of these maps play

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.720 
change the way a lot of these maps play
that<00:02:22.140> would<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.650> would<00:02:22.710> really<00:02:23.100> change<00:02:23.430> that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that would that would really change that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
that would that would really change that
the<00:02:23.880> mindset<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.170> in

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
the mindset you have to take in in

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.560 
the mindset you have to take in in
battlefield<00:02:25.950> 3<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.940> don't<00:02:27.210> know<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.510> would

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
battlefield 3 so I don't know if I would

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.700 
battlefield 3 so I don't know if I would
want<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.020> something<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
want to see something like that and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.890 
want to see something like that and
battlefield<00:02:29.100> 4<00:02:29.280> surprisingly<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:30.600> kind<00:02:30.870> of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
battlefield 4 surprisingly it's kind of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.870 
battlefield 4 surprisingly it's kind of
a<00:02:30.990> shocker<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.470> hear<00:02:31.620> myself<00:02:31.800> say<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.460> let

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
a shocker to hear myself say that let

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.060 
a shocker to hear myself say that let
alone<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.300> know<00:02:33.420> endorse<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.800> i<00:02:34.830> think

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
alone you know endorse it but i think

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.470 
alone you know endorse it but i think
the<00:02:35.160> squad<00:02:35.400> sighs<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.730> should<00:02:35.910> definitely<00:02:36.300> stay

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the squad sighs I should definitely stay

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120 
the squad sighs I should definitely stay
at<00:02:36.570> 4i<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.260> makes<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.770> game<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> little

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
at 4i think it makes the game a little

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.430 
at 4i think it makes the game a little
bit<00:02:38.430> more<00:02:38.610> balanced<00:02:39.120> unless<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.020> figure<00:02:40.320> out

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bit more balanced unless they figure out

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.410 
bit more balanced unless they figure out
a<00:02:40.470> way<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.770> make<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> maps<00:02:41.520> integrate<00:02:42.090> into

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
a way to make the maps integrate into

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.140 
a way to make the maps integrate into
larger<00:02:42.810> squad<00:02:43.080> sighs<00:02:43.290> maybe<00:02:44.220> nerf<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.880> medic

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
larger squad sighs maybe nerf the medic

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.580 
larger squad sighs maybe nerf the medic
to<00:02:45.300> an<00:02:45.420> extent<00:02:45.780> where<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.020> don't<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to an extent where you don't have you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.410 
to an extent where you don't have you
know<00:02:46.680> six-man<00:02:47.190> medic<00:02:47.580> trains<00:02:47.850> running<00:02:48.180> around

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
know six-man medic trains running around

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.610 
know six-man medic trains running around
because<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.840> already<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.200> problem<00:02:49.500> with

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
because that's already a problem with

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.800 
because that's already a problem with
four<00:02:49.800> people<00:02:50.070> imagine<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.210> six<00:02:51.480> people

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
four people imagine it with six people

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.930 
four people imagine it with six people
it<00:02:52.530> could<00:02:52.710> get<00:02:52.830> quite<00:02:53.100> frustrating<00:02:53.700> kind<00:02:53.880> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it could get quite frustrating kind of

across<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.360> board<00:04:12.600> something<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.320> I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
across the board something that I

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.980 
across the board something that I
thought<00:04:14.610> was<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.880> brilliant<00:04:15.180> idea<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.660> think<00:04:15.750> it

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
thought was a brilliant idea I think it

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.450 
thought was a brilliant idea I think it
works<00:04:16.170> perfectly<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:16.859> there<00:04:17.040> are<00:04:17.190> some

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
works perfectly but there are some

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.190 
works perfectly but there are some
problems<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.210> there's<00:04:18.570> nothing<00:04:19.020> more

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
problems with it there's nothing more

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.750 
problems with it there's nothing more
annoying<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:19.799> world<00:04:19.980> than<00:04:20.250> getting<00:04:20.580> into

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
annoying in the world than getting into

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.340 
annoying in the world than getting into
a<00:04:20.790> squad<00:04:21.150> with<00:04:21.419> three<00:04:21.750> people<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.200> are

unfortunately and I would like to see
them<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.410> battlefield<00:04:29.860> 4<00:04:29.920> put<00:04:30.370> something<00:04:30.790> into

them in battlefield 4 put something into

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.820 
them in battlefield 4 put something into
the<00:04:31.090> game<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.450> actually<00:04:31.900> stopped<00:04:32.350> other

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the game that actually stopped other

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.740 
the game that actually stopped other
players<00:04:33.280> from<00:04:33.520> stacking<00:04:33.910> squad<00:04:34.360> perks<00:04:34.630> like

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
players from stacking squad perks like

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.080 
players from stacking squad perks like
that<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.200> let's<00:04:35.920> say<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.490> squad<00:04:36.790> amo

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
that so let's say I have on squad amo

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.780 
that so let's say I have on squad amo
let's<00:04:37.870> say<00:04:38.020> Billy<00:04:38.290> joins<00:04:38.650> my<00:04:38.890> squad<00:04:39.190> we<00:04:39.580> want

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
let's say Billy joins my squad we want

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.460 
let's say Billy joins my squad we want
to<00:04:39.850> play<00:04:39.970> together<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.450> Billy<00:04:40.630> also<00:04:41.050> tries<00:04:41.290> to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
to play together and Billy also tries to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.170 
to play together and Billy also tries to
put<00:04:41.620> on<00:04:41.710> squad<00:04:42.040> ammo<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.790> game<00:04:43.030> would

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
put on squad ammo the game would

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.430 
put on squad ammo the game would
actually<00:04:43.570> say<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.050> was<00:04:44.260> like

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
actually say that that was like

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.050 
actually say that that was like
unavailable<00:04:45.070> or<00:04:45.160> wouldn't<00:04:45.490> let<00:04:45.640> him<00:04:45.820> actually

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
unavailable or wouldn't let him actually

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.790 
unavailable or wouldn't let him actually
put<00:04:46.390> that<00:04:46.540> on<00:04:46.660> there<00:04:46.840> because<00:04:47.170> i<00:04:47.200> already<00:04:47.500> have

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
put that on there because i already have

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.950 
put that on there because i already have
squat<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> milan<00:04:48.700> that<00:04:49.330> would<00:04:49.450> make<00:04:49.570> it<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:49.840> that

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
squat a milan that would make it so that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.150 
squat a milan that would make it so that
we<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.290> run<00:04:50.590> into<00:04:50.620> those<00:04:50.920> situations

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
we don't run into those situations

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.370 
we don't run into those situations
anymore<00:04:51.700> I<00:04:51.940> know<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.360> pretty<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:53.350> know

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
anymore I know it's pretty you know

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.920 
anymore I know it's pretty you know
trivial<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.100> be<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.400> okay<00:04:54.820> people<00:04:55.420> are<00:04:55.510> too

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
trivial to be like okay people are too

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.450 
trivial to be like okay people are too
stupid<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.560> but<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.920> lot<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.100> times<00:04:57.310> if

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
stupid to do that but a lot of times if

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.760 
stupid to do that but a lot of times if
you're<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:57.730> playing<00:04:58.260> with<00:04:59.260> friends<00:04:59.470> if

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
you're not playing with friends if

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.050 
you're not playing with friends if
you're<00:04:59.920> just<00:05:00.040> playing<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.460> know<00:05:00.550> solo<00:05:00.820> like

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
you're just playing you know solo like

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.310 
you're just playing you know solo like
I'm<00:05:01.180> doing<00:05:01.450> here<00:05:01.600> it's<00:05:01.720> really<00:05:01.990> hard<00:05:02.200> to

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
I'm doing here it's really hard to

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260 
I'm doing here it's really hard to
communicate<00:05:02.560> with<00:05:02.800> people<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.120> would

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
communicate with people so that would

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.520 
communicate with people so that would
make<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.450> so<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.870> would<00:05:04.990> force<00:05:05.290> them<00:05:05.470> to

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
make it so that it would force them to

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.170 
make it so that it would force them to
use<00:05:05.890> a<00:05:05.920> different<00:05:06.040> squad<00:05:06.520> perk<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:06.880> think<00:05:07.090> that

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
use a different squad perk I think that

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.490 
use a different squad perk I think that
would<00:05:07.270> be<00:05:07.360> beneficial<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:08.020> think<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.380> would

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
would be beneficial I think that would

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.530 
would be beneficial I think that would
be<00:05:08.650> awesome<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:10.180> would<00:05:10.390> totally

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
be awesome it would totally

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.900 
be awesome it would totally
revolutionize<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.710> squad<00:05:12.010> specialization

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
revolutionize the squad specialization

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.670 
revolutionize the squad specialization
system<00:05:13.300> because<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.780> would<00:05:13.930> finally<00:05:14.350> get<00:05:14.500> to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
system because you would finally get to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.170 
system because you would finally get to
see<00:05:14.860> some<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.280> other<00:05:15.310> ones<00:05:15.670> that<00:05:15.940> aren't

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
see some of the other ones that aren't

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.610 
see some of the other ones that aren't
aren't<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.750> same<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.260> don't<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.470> know<00:05:17.560> you

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
aren't the same you don't you know you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.230 
aren't the same you don't you know you
don't<00:05:17.770> have<00:05:17.890> three<00:05:18.190> people<00:05:18.460> run<00:05:18.669> squad<00:05:19.000> amo

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
don't have three people run squad amo

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.490 
don't have three people run squad amo
squad<00:05:19.540> sprint<00:05:19.870> which<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.110> think<00:05:20.260> are<00:05:20.350> probably

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
squad sprint which I think are probably

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.930 
squad sprint which I think are probably
the<00:05:20.710> two<00:05:20.770> most<00:05:20.919> common<00:05:21.490> ones<00:05:21.640> you<00:05:21.730> see

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
the two most common ones you see

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.790 
the two most common ones you see
probably<00:05:22.630> because<00:05:22.900> of<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.140> first<00:05:23.380> two<00:05:23.590> only

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
probably because of the first two only

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.070 
probably because of the first two only
one<00:05:24.100> left<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.300> lot<00:05:25.480> of<00:05:25.510> questions<00:05:25.930> have

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
one left but a lot of questions have

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.270 
one left but a lot of questions have
been<00:05:26.110> surrounding<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.650> know<00:05:26.800> what<00:05:27.010> kind<00:05:27.220> of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
been surrounding you know what kind of

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.740 
been surrounding you know what kind of
different<00:05:27.640> specializations<00:05:28.240> are<00:05:28.510> they<00:05:28.600> going

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
different specializations are they going

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.510 
different specializations are they going
to<00:05:28.810> bring<00:05:29.470> into<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.740> game<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:30.070> know<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.250> lot<00:05:30.460> of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
to bring into the game I know a lot of

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.820 
to bring into the game I know a lot of
the<00:05:30.700> rumored<00:05:31.090> things<00:05:31.360> back<00:05:31.600> when<00:05:32.440> premium

the rumored things back when premium

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.110 
the rumored things back when premium

first release was that they were going
to<00:05:34.150> release<00:05:34.450> new<00:05:34.590> specializations<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.770> know

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
to release new specializations you know

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.500 
to release new specializations you know
squad<00:05:36.400> healing<00:05:36.850> that<00:05:37.000> was<00:05:37.180> one<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.450> was

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
squad healing that was one that was

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.730 
squad healing that was one that was
thrown<00:05:37.720> around<00:05:37.870> because<00:05:38.169> apparently<00:05:38.560> that

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
thrown around because apparently that

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.970 
thrown around because apparently that
was<00:05:38.860> one<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.870> existed<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.290> really<00:05:41.830> early

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
was one that existed in a really early

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.320 
was one that existed in a really early
build<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.520> game<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.850> mean<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.030> don't<00:05:43.240> know

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
build of the game I mean I don't know

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330 
build of the game I mean I don't know
how<00:05:43.540> legit<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.080> information<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.770> but<00:05:45.250> I've

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
how legit that information is but I've

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.890 
how legit that information is but I've
heard<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.669> several<00:05:46.120> different<00:05:46.450> times<00:05:46.660> so<00:05:46.810> I

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
heard that several different times so I

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.850 
heard that several different times so I
actually<00:05:47.140> think<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.470> would<00:05:47.680> be<00:05:47.770> an

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
actually think that would be an

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.620 
actually think that would be an
interesting<00:05:48.070> one<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.610> add<00:05:48.880> into<00:05:49.180> battlefield

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
interesting one to add into battlefield

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.330 
interesting one to add into battlefield
4<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.080> essentially<00:05:50.740> what<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> would<00:05:51.160> do<00:05:51.310> is

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
4 and essentially what it would do is

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980 
4 and essentially what it would do is
they<00:05:51.669> would<00:05:51.700> it<00:05:52.090> would<00:05:52.180> increase<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.600> heel

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
they would it would increase the heel

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.409 
they would it would increase the heel
time<00:05:53.229> so<00:05:54.100> you<00:05:54.160> would<00:05:54.370> heal<00:05:54.550> much<00:05:54.729> faster<00:05:54.790> I

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
time so you would heal much faster I

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.060 
time so you would heal much faster I
don't<00:05:55.870> know<00:05:55.960> if<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:56.229> revolves<00:05:57.010> around

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
don't know if that revolves around

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.740 
don't know if that revolves around
standing<00:05:57.520> on<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.669> med<00:05:57.880> pack<00:05:58.120> or<00:05:58.330> just<00:05:58.540> you

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
standing on a med pack or just you

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.570 
standing on a med pack or just you
healing<00:05:59.140> faster<00:05:59.560> and<00:05:59.740> you<00:06:00.010> know<00:06:00.100> as<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.250> general

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
healing faster and you know as a general

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.219 
healing faster and you know as a general
rule<00:06:00.610> like<00:06:00.970> everybody<00:06:01.360> everybody<00:06:02.020> in<00:06:02.110> your

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
rule like everybody everybody in your

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.140 
rule like everybody everybody in your
squad<00:06:02.470> heels<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.800> little<00:06:02.890> bit<00:06:03.100> quicker<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.640> think

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
squad heels a little bit quicker I think

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.310 
squad heels a little bit quicker I think
that's<00:06:04.300> cool<00:06:04.479> I<00:06:04.630> mean<00:06:04.660> that's<00:06:04.930> something<00:06:05.140> that

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
that's cool I mean that's something that

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.750 
that's cool I mean that's something that
was<00:06:05.500> actually<00:06:05.830> in<00:06:05.950> home<00:06:06.220> front<00:06:06.520> if<00:06:06.669> you

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
was actually in home front if you

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.159 
was actually in home front if you
remember<00:06:07.120> that<00:06:07.210> was<00:06:07.330> actually<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:07.660> perk<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.050> it

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
remember that was actually a perk and it

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.540 
remember that was actually a perk and it
worked<00:06:08.350> out<00:06:08.500> pretty<00:06:08.710> pretty<00:06:09.220> good<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.430> think

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
worked out pretty pretty good I think

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.400 
worked out pretty pretty good I think
that<00:06:09.820> was<00:06:09.940> one<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.240> coolest<00:06:10.960> things<00:06:11.260> about

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
that was one of the coolest things about

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.280 
that was one of the coolest things about
homefront<00:06:12.040> were<00:06:12.160> some<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.610> uniqueness

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
homefront were some of the uniqueness

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.540 
homefront were some of the uniqueness
behind<00:06:14.290> some<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.620> their<00:06:14.710> perks<00:06:14.950> systems<00:06:15.400> and

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
behind some of their perks systems and

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.040 
behind some of their perks systems and
stuff<00:06:15.760> so<00:06:15.970> I<00:06:16.000> would<00:06:16.210> definitely<00:06:16.240> love<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.810> see

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
stuff so I would definitely love to see

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.420 
stuff so I would definitely love to see
something<00:06:17.260> like<00:06:17.380> that<00:06:17.530> another<00:06:17.919> idea<00:06:18.310> I've

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
something like that another idea I've

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.430 
something like that another idea I've
had<00:06:18.640> is<00:06:19.180> actually<00:06:19.419> something<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:19.930> revolves

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
had is actually something that revolves

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.159 
had is actually something that revolves
around<00:06:20.530> repairing<00:06:21.400> faster<00:06:21.790> so<00:06:22.000> a<00:06:22.030> squad<00:06:22.630> squad

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
around repairing faster so a squad squad

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.900 
around repairing faster so a squad squad
repair<00:06:23.620> something<00:06:23.979> you<00:06:24.250> know<00:06:24.340> probably<00:06:24.640> come

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
repair something you know probably come

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.280 
repair something you know probably come
up<00:06:24.940> with<00:06:25.180> a<00:06:25.210> fancier<00:06:25.630> name<00:06:25.690> than<00:06:25.960> that<00:06:26.080> but

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
up with a fancier name than that but

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.719 
up with a fancier name than that but
essentially<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:26.740> would<00:06:26.830> allow<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:27.130> to<00:06:27.400> repair

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
essentially it would allow you to repair

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:28.950 
essentially it would allow you to repair
vehicles<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:28.270> little<00:06:28.450> bit<00:06:28.570> faster<00:06:28.720> now

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
vehicles a little bit faster now

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.520 
vehicles a little bit faster now
honestly<00:06:29.890> that<00:06:30.130> would<00:06:30.250> require<00:06:30.520> them<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.000> tune

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
honestly that would require them to tune

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.810 
honestly that would require them to tune
the<00:06:32.530> repair<00:06:32.860> tool<00:06:33.040> so<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.490> doesn't<00:06:33.760> get

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
the repair tool so it doesn't get

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.310 
the repair tool so it doesn't get
overpowered<00:06:34.210> because<00:06:34.600> I<00:06:34.660> know<00:06:34.720> that<00:06:35.050> they

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
overpowered because I know that they

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.170 
overpowered because I know that they
they<00:06:35.830> nerf<00:06:36.070> the<00:06:36.280> repair<00:06:36.610> tool<00:06:36.789> it<00:06:36.910> used<00:06:37.090> to

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
they nerf the repair tool it used to

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.480 
they nerf the repair tool it used to
repair<00:06:37.450> much<00:06:37.720> faster<00:06:38.200> back<00:06:39.010> in<00:06:39.160> some<00:06:39.310> of<00:06:39.400> the

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
repair much faster back in some of the

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.900 
repair much faster back in some of the
earlier<00:06:39.520> versions<00:06:40.240> of<00:06:40.330> battlefield

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
earlier versions of battlefield

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.550 
earlier versions of battlefield
ree<00:06:41.000> but<00:06:41.480> I<00:06:41.510> would<00:06:41.690> love<00:06:41.810> to<00:06:41.870> see<00:06:42.140> them<00:06:42.320> bring

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
ree but I would love to see them bring

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.840 
ree but I would love to see them bring
something<00:06:42.920> like<00:06:42.950> that<00:06:43.220> in<00:06:43.370> there<00:06:43.550> because

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
something like that in there because

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.280 
something like that in there because
it's<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.090> passive<00:06:44.540> perk<00:06:44.780> it's<00:06:44.990> something

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
it's a passive perk it's something

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.690 
it's a passive perk it's something
that's<00:06:45.440> not<00:06:45.590> going<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:45.980> be<00:06:46.010> a<00:06:46.100> huge<00:06:46.370> game

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
that's not going to be a huge game

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.880 
that's not going to be a huge game
breaker<00:06:46.970> but<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.360> would<00:06:47.480> it<00:06:47.690> would<00:06:47.890> promote

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
breaker but it would it would promote

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.770 
breaker but it would it would promote
people<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.430> k<00:06:49.580> get<00:06:49.850> out<00:06:49.940> repair<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.420> vehicles

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
people to k get out repair the vehicles

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.180 
people to k get out repair the vehicles
you<00:06:50.900> know<00:06:51.080> you<00:06:51.170> can<00:06:51.320> repair<00:06:51.530> it<00:06:51.620> a<00:06:51.650> lot<00:06:51.800> faster

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
you know you can repair it a lot faster

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.860 
you know you can repair it a lot faster
than<00:06:52.280> you<00:06:52.400> used<00:06:52.520> to<00:06:52.640> and<00:06:53.570> that's<00:06:53.690> something

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
than you used to and that's something

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.510 
than you used to and that's something
that<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.110> would<00:06:54.260> love<00:06:54.500> to<00:06:54.680> see<00:06:54.860> in<00:06:55.070> battlefield

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
is a very polarizing topic some people

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.350 
is a very polarizing topic some people
really<00:07:10.100> like<00:07:10.190> the<00:07:10.460> specializations<00:07:11.180> other

really like the specializations other
people<00:07:11.720> think<00:07:11.900> is<00:07:12.020> just<00:07:12.200> too<00:07:12.410> much<00:07:12.560> like<00:07:12.800> call

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
people think is just too much like call

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.280 
people think is just too much like call
of<00:07:13.040> duty<00:07:13.340> I'm<00:07:14.030> pretty<00:07:14.330> much<00:07:14.510> you<00:07:14.660> know<00:07:14.780> I'm<00:07:14.960> Pro

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
of duty I'm pretty much you know I'm Pro

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.750 
of duty I'm pretty much you know I'm Pro
specializations<00:07:16.040> I<00:07:16.100> think<00:07:16.250> it<00:07:16.370> adds<00:07:16.520> a<00:07:16.640> new

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
specializations I think it adds a new

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760 
specializations I think it adds a new
dynamic<00:07:17.000> to<00:07:17.270> the<00:07:17.360> game<00:07:17.660> I<00:07:17.900> think<00:07:18.350> due<00:07:18.530> to<00:07:18.650> the

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
dynamic to the game I think due to the

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.290 
dynamic to the game I think due to the
fact<00:07:18.950> that<00:07:19.130> the<00:07:19.310> a<00:07:19.340> lot<00:07:19.730> of<00:07:19.820> these<00:07:19.910> things<00:07:19.970> are

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
fact that the a lot of these things are

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.870 
fact that the a lot of these things are
passive<00:07:20.750> you<00:07:20.870> know<00:07:20.990> you<00:07:21.050> don't<00:07:21.350> have<00:07:21.560> to<00:07:21.880> it's

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
passive you know you don't have to it's

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.370 
passive you know you don't have to it's
not<00:07:23.000> like<00:07:23.150> it<00:07:23.300> increases<00:07:23.840> your<00:07:23.870> bullet<00:07:24.260> damage

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
not like it increases your bullet damage

not like it increases your bullet damage
or<00:07:24.680> anything<00:07:24.830> crazy<00:07:25.040> like<00:07:25.220> that<00:07:25.370> it<00:07:25.670> usually
