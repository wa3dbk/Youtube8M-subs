00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hi guys, how are you? We move the process. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 step by step of this gradient that I did 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.270
 in the eyes using this part had 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 catarina and river 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.150
 so it was from his clearest zio passing 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.670
 from the darkest to the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.530
 of shadow I used only this little planet as 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.180
 You can see in the following video. 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.670
 and to learn just to continue watching 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 start applying the judgment here 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.930
 on my eyelid and coming up here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930
 also economic 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.010
 not need to go pretty straight forward that 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 People are going to spread this, I'm going to spread it with 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 fear even looks 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.460
 I'll show you why. 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.190
 mix jumbo ana cormick it's the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.129
 white and white makes the color last 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.309
 Its more vibrant looking here has been in 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:09.250
 up the game and here without his eyes is 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.390
 here at the angle I want and I'm going to pull 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 into the eyelid 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700
 I will not take that shadow to the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.710
 At that point I want her to stay in 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.000
 final because after we a suitcase 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 it will rise higher 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.460
 there the people risk getting to the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 eyebrow to get an effect that I 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.150
 I do not want to 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.310
 and here it is, look, there goes a 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.460
 I presume who serves I pulled to leave 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.310
 more mouse and here begins the drawing 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.060
 rounded it will look like this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.709
 Old man that I start drawing and with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.929
 next we will continue 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.859
 and so on until you reach the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.959
 inner corner 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.240
 now comes as long as the voltage that is equal 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:02.880
 people to be black and I will apply 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:08.759
 This gift is a dark blue and I'm going 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.579
 apply after black looks but actually 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.680
 I'm going a little bit over the black because 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.049
 the idea is that these colors have a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.599
 transition between them that is not 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.120
 so evident where one started the other 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.940
 We ended but have to merge to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 stay with a more natural finish 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.269
 Like I said to you, I'm going to give 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.700
 continuity of the drawing to the event is 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.170
 giving continuity here and now I will 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.680
 to see with that blue tone I showed 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.650
 at first for you here and it's that tone 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.709
 here I remember here that part was 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.989
 without shadow and once again giving 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.989
 continuity the design up here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.530
 I come back here, look where you started, I'm not going. 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.760
 bring to the inner corner because the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.900
 People are going to eliminate this inner corner . 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.900
 another shade 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.190
 It's also going to bring a little bit up. 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.900
 this other blue was forming now 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.720
 You see how these colors go up and finish 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.990
 going up a little bit are also the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:32.640
 Reinforcement Here Looks Black Now 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.640
 to condense even smoking 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.830
 I will reinforce the dark blue 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.130
 the light blue I will also eliminate the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.130
 inner corner 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.550
 bring a little bit here up there 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.550
 line and I'm going to draw now 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:28.170
 that same pain in my Opel will 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.170
 here below the lower lashes 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.689
 Respecting me, I'm not going 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:43.379
 pass on him and I'll think about it too 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:47.849
 on the line gaga will use the curvex you 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.829
 places here looks very close to the root of the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.549
 eyelashes and date 

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:56.239
 feeling fondling chicken does not squeeze 

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:56.239
 but again 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.190
 there you are feeling that you are not 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.250
 searching, it's okay, you press I do 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.640
 so it is fragrant grip to the other 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.640
 Just so up I 'll stay the mask 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.890
 catching two bells jazz 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.400
 I will also stay on the lower lashes 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.050
 at least indac mark 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.879
 so that 's it folks I hope you 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.620
