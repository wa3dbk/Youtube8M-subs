00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
two plus or the three because it runs

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.040

about<00:01:10.759> eight<00:01:11.030> hundred<00:01:11.060> dollars<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:11.899> have<00:01:12.020> a

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
about eight hundred dollars and I have a

about eight hundred dollars and I have a
best<00:01:12.259> buy<00:01:12.470> credit<00:01:12.530> card<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.789> something<00:01:14.149> just

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
best buy credit card but something just

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180 
best buy credit card but something just
came<00:01:14.509> out<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.869> DG<00:01:15.229> i<00:01:15.259> had<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.860> i<00:01:15.920> think

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
came out that DG i had and i think

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.180

it works out well you know the biggest

it works out well you know the biggest
thing<00:01:50.360> was<00:01:50.509> there<00:01:50.660> was<00:01:50.720> no<00:01:50.989> one<00:01:51.140> else<00:01:51.170> kind<00:01:51.560> of

thing was there was no one else kind of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.109 
thing was there was no one else kind of
doing<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.069> in<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.459> market<00:01:52.940> and

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
doing this in this market and

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.260 
doing this in this market and

essentially DG DJI even though this is a
very<00:01:56.649> pricey<00:01:57.759> investment<00:01:59.229> just<00:02:00.229> came<00:02:00.410> out

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
very pricey investment just came out

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.219 
very pricey investment just came out
with<00:02:00.739> their<00:02:00.950> DJI<00:02:01.459> phantom<00:02:01.550> 3<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.899> it's<00:02:03.050> in<00:02:03.140> that

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
with their DJI phantom 3 so it's in that

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.749 
with their DJI phantom 3 so it's in that
newer<00:02:03.500> line<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.979> they<00:02:04.099> have<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.610> still

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
newer line that they have but it still

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.120 
newer line that they have but it still
looks<00:02:04.789> like<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.119> little<00:02:05.360> bit<00:02:05.479> their<00:02:05.599> older<00:02:05.840> one

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
looks like a little bit their older one

does<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.650> without<00:03:16.920> having<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.730> do<00:03:17.880> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
does this without having to do that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
does this without having to do that
necessarily<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.900> you're<00:03:19.350> controlling<00:03:19.710> it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
necessarily and you're controlling it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.770 
necessarily and you're controlling it
from<00:03:19.920> your<00:03:20.340> phone<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.240> don't<00:03:21.360> need<00:03:21.660> to

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
from your phone so you don't need to

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
from your phone so you don't need to
have<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.050> necessarily<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.710> specific<00:03:22.950> person

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
have it necessarily on a specific person

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.360 
have it necessarily on a specific person
with<00:03:24.240> this<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:24.900> map<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.830> your<00:03:26.160> phone

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
with this you can map it on your phone

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
with this you can map it on your phone
you<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.580> set<00:03:26.910> waypoints<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:27.870> certain

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
you can set waypoints of do certain

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.020 
you can set waypoints of do certain
things<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:29.040> say<00:03:29.070> how<00:03:29.340> far<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.820> want<00:03:29.940> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
things you can say how far you want to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.030 
things you can say how far you want to
go<00:03:30.090> all<00:03:30.420> different<00:03:30.870> kind<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.140> stuff<00:03:31.410> it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
go all different kind of stuff it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.880 
go all different kind of stuff it's
doing<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.850> only<00:03:33.480> thing<00:03:33.600> left<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.200> lily<00:03:34.770> has

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
doing the only thing left that lily has

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.410 
doing the only thing left that lily has
is<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.490> waterproof<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.270> know<00:03:36.360> if

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
is that that's waterproof you know if

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.840 
is that that's waterproof you know if
you<00:03:36.540> fly<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:36.960> into<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> river<00:03:37.650> or<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> lake<00:03:37.950> it's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
you fly this into a river or a lake it's

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.250 
you fly this into a river or a lake it's
a<00:03:38.940> good<00:03:39.150> chance<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:40.020> know

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
a good chance that you're you know

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.570 
a good chance that you're you know
you're<00:03:40.290> going<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.620> lose<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.980> fan<00:03:41.160> unless<00:03:41.370> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
you're going to lose this fan unless you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.640 
you're going to lose this fan unless you
have<00:03:41.730> insurance<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.480> other<00:03:43.020> than<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.230> this

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
have insurance but other than that this

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.170 
have insurance but other than that this
is<00:03:43.860> pretty<00:03:44.070> much<00:03:44.220> blowing<00:03:44.580> away<00:03:44.760> anything

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
is pretty much blowing away anything

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.340 
is pretty much blowing away anything
that<00:03:45.330> Lily<00:03:45.630> had<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.680> am<00:03:47.600> amazingly<00:03:48.600> excited

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
that Lily had and I am amazingly excited

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.460 
that Lily had and I am amazingly excited
about<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.060> 800<00:03:51.540> bucks<00:03:51.720> 12

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
about this now you know so 800 bucks 12

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.930 
about this now you know so 800 bucks 12
megapixel<00:03:52.950> still<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.190> same<00:03:53.340> exact<00:03:53.670> thing<00:03:53.850> is

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
megapixel still the same exact thing is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.600 
megapixel still the same exact thing is
the<00:03:54.030> other<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.930> as<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.140> said<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.610> 2.7

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
the other one but as I said you get 2.7

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.660 
the other one but as I said you get 2.7
k<00:03:57.290> resolution<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.770> get<00:03:58.920> effectively<00:03:59.280> 2k

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
k resolution so you get effectively 2k

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.520 
k resolution so you get effectively 2k
resolution<00:03:59.850> you're<00:04:00.360> not<00:04:00.450> getting<00:04:00.660> 4k<00:04:01.050> you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
resolution you're not getting 4k you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.870 
resolution you're not getting 4k you

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
fan favorite because it's actually not a
