which<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.759> running<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
which I have right here running a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.560

so these things I think are good to go
now<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.130> tangible<00:01:41.549> heads<00:01:41.909> with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
now they got some tangible heads with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170 
now they got some tangible heads with
like<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.600> impact<00:01:43.020> driver<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.460> even<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> little

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
like an impact driver and even a little

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.550 
like an impact driver and even a little
jigsaw<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.990> stuff<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.380> haven't

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
jigsaw and all that stuff I haven't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069 
jigsaw and all that stuff I haven't
tried<00:01:46.770> any<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.220> yet<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
tried any of those yet and I have

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
tried any of those yet and I have
separate<00:01:49.439> tools<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> those<00:01:50.040> purposes<00:01:50.640> anyway

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
separate tools to those purposes anyway

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
separate tools to those purposes anyway
so<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> speak<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> how

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so I'm not going to speak to how

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.920 
so I'm not going to speak to how
effective<00:01:53.100> those<00:01:53.310> are

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
effective those are

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.040 
effective those are
however<00:01:54.830> if<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.820> decide<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.240> go<00:01:56.480> with<00:01:56.600> those<00:01:56.810> I

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
however if you decide to go with those I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.770 
however if you decide to go with those I
would<00:01:57.320> suggest<00:01:57.500> getting<00:01:57.920> two<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.480> have<00:01:59.750> a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
would suggest getting two so you have a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.570 
would suggest getting two so you have a
spare<00:02:00.230> one<00:02:00.410> of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.620> motor<00:02:00.800> bodies<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.520> you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580
