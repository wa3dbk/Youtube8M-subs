hi I'm Paul ball from how to play bass
calm<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.310> video<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> have<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
calm in this video we're going to have a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.690 
calm in this video we're going to have a
quick<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.359> at<00:00:06.720> drop<00:00:07.049> D<00:00:07.230> tuning<00:00:07.700> firstly

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
quick look at drop D tuning firstly

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.280 
quick look at drop D tuning firstly
we're<00:00:09.059> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.240> look<00:00:09.389> at<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> drop<00:00:10.110> D

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
we're going to look at what is drop D

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.879 
we're going to look at what is drop D
tuning

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
tuning

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
tuning
then<00:00:11.460> we're<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> look<00:00:12.210> at<00:00:12.360> two<00:00:12.540> ways

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
then we're going to look at two ways

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.900 
then we're going to look at two ways
that<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.110> tune<00:00:13.530> your<00:00:13.559> bass<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.490> get<00:00:14.670> drop

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that you can tune your bass to get drop

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.080 
that you can tune your bass to get drop
D<00:00:15.089> tuning<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> drop<00:00:16.980> D<00:00:17.130> tuning<00:00:17.160> well

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
D tuning so what is drop D tuning well

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.750 
D tuning so what is drop D tuning well
drop<00:00:18.869> D<00:00:19.080> tuning<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.619> an<00:00:19.710> alternative<00:00:20.220> tuning

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
drop D tuning is an alternative tuning

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.109 
drop D tuning is an alternative tuning
method<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> standard<00:00:22.170> tuning<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> e<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.400> D

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
method to the standard tuning of e a D

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
method to the standard tuning of e a D
and<00:00:24.330> G<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:25.109> you're<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.560> familiar<00:00:25.890> with

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and G that you're probably familiar with

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
and G that you're probably familiar with
now<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.119> hundreds<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.570> alternative

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
now there are hundreds of alternative

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
now there are hundreds of alternative
tunings<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.250> drop<00:00:29.460> D<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> probably<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.390> most

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
tunings but drop D is probably the most

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
tunings but drop D is probably the most
common<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.679> we're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
common and it's the one we're going to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
common and it's the one we're going to
look<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.279> today<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.780> drop<00:00:34.050> D<00:00:34.230> tuning

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
look at today and you get drop D tuning

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.970 
look at today and you get drop D tuning

E string to D to get drop D tuning when
you<00:01:01.590> D<00:01:01.800> tune<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.219> E<00:01:02.399> string<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.820> drop<00:01:03.080> drop<00:01:04.080> D

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you D tune your E string to drop drop D

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
you D tune your E string to drop drop D
tuning<00:01:04.760> what<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.570> going

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
tuning what you're doing is you're going

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
tuning what you're doing is you're going
down<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> tone<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> tone<00:01:08.340> equals<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:08.939> frets

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
down a tone and a tone equals two frets

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
down a tone and a tone equals two frets
so<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.260> E<00:01:10.290> string<00:01:10.409> moves<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.159> D<00:01:11.340> all

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so when your E string moves to D all

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
so when your E string moves to D all
your<00:01:12.030> notes<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.930> locations<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.710> effectively

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
your notes the locations off effectively

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.060 
your notes the locations off effectively
move<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:14.820> frets<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.530> which<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.920> at

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
move up two frets so a which is here at

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
move up two frets so a which is here at
the<00:01:17.130> fifth<00:01:17.369> fret<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> E<00:01:18.420> string<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the fifth fret of the E string when you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
the fifth fret of the E string when you
in<00:01:19.650> drop<00:01:19.979> D<00:01:20.009> tuning<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.390> e<00:01:21.570> string<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
in drop D tuning and this e string is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
in drop D tuning and this e string is
tuned<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> D<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.710> goes<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.210> seventh

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
tuned to D a goes here to the seventh

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
tuned to D a goes here to the seventh
fret<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.860> you're<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
fret so what you do you're going to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
fret so what you do you're going to
sound<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> open<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.479> string<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:29.280> you're

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
sound the open a string then you're

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
sound the open a string then you're
going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> sound<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.689> fretted<00:01:31.200> note<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
going to sound the fretted note at the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
going to sound the fretted note at the
seventh<00:01:32.850> fret<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> E<00:01:33.479> string<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
seventh fret of the E string and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170 
seventh fret of the E string and
obviously<00:01:34.920> those<00:01:35.070> two<00:01:35.100> won't<00:01:35.579> sound<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> same

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
obviously those two won't sound the same

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
obviously those two won't sound the same
but<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
but then what you're going to do is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
but then what you're going to do is
while<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:37.920> keeping<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:39.240> note<00:01:39.509> fretted

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
while you're keeping this note fretted

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
while you're keeping this note fretted
with<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.350> left<00:01:40.560> hand<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.070> reach<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.820> with

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
with the left hand you reach over with

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
with the left hand you reach over with
the<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.210> hand<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the right hand so you can get that in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
the right hand so you can get that in
there<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> tuning<00:01:45.659> pegs

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
there we go and get into the tuning pegs

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.710 
there we go and get into the tuning pegs
and<00:01:46.259> detune<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.189> tuning<00:01:47.759> peg<00:01:48.030> until<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.540> two

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and detune the tuning peg until the two

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870 
and detune the tuning peg until the two
notes<00:01:48.930> sound<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> same<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.700> what

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
notes sound the same so that's what

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
notes sound the same so that's what
we're<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.960> here's<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> open<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
we're going to do so here's the open a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.070 
we're going to do so here's the open a
string

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
string

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.400 
string
here's<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> nodes<00:01:54.770> at<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:54.950> 7th<00:01:55.310> fret<00:01:56.410> here

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
here's the nodes at the 7th fret here

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:05.980 
here's the nodes at the 7th fret here
they're<00:01:57.620> different<00:02:04.300> there<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.330> think<00:02:05.510> that's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
they're different there I think that's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.510 
they're different there I think that's
pretty<00:02:06.410> close<00:02:08.560> there<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:09.619> go<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.130> then<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.400> I

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
pretty close there we go and then if I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.180 
pretty close there we go and then if I
play<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:10.910> open<00:02:11.150> string<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.710> hear<00:02:13.040> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
play the open string you can hear that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.350 
play the open string you can hear that
slower<00:02:13.490> than<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.940> E<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.430> that's<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.940> drop<00:02:17.150> D

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
slower than the E and that's you drop D

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.670 
slower than the E and that's you drop D
tuning<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.120> second<00:02:20.660> method<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.350> going<00:02:21.590> to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
tuning so the second method is going to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.770 
tuning so the second method is going to
be<00:02:21.770> very<00:02:22.040> similar<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.670> first<00:02:22.910> method<00:02:23.330> but

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
be very similar to the first method but

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.570 
be very similar to the first method but
instead<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.080> using<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.560> open<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.010> string<00:02:25.040> and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
instead of using the open a string and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.760 
instead of using the open a string and
the<00:02:26.000> note<00:02:26.180> at<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> 7th<00:02:26.840> fret<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> E<00:02:27.410> string

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
the note at the 7th fret of the E string

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.050 
the note at the 7th fret of the E string
what<00:02:28.220> we're<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.490> do<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.760> we're<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.910 
what we're going to do is we're going to
sound<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.360> note<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> 12th<00:02:30.320> fret<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.800> E

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
sound the note at the 12th fret of the E

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.090 
sound the note at the 12th fret of the E
string<00:02:31.370> obviously<00:02:32.060> when<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:33.230> string<00:02:33.980> is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
string obviously when that string is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.070 
string obviously when that string is
tuned<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.340> e<00:02:34.610> that's<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.360> octave<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.780> E<00:02:35.900> which

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
tuned to e that's the octave of E which

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.260 
tuned to e that's the octave of E which
is<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> e<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:37.190> by<00:02:37.310> using<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.700> open<00:02:37.970> D<00:02:38.240> string

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
is the e but by using the open D string

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.960 
is the e but by using the open D string
and<00:02:39.170> sounding<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.710> against<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.280> note<00:02:40.520> here

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
and sounding that against this note here

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.120 
and sounding that against this note here
and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.570> detuning<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.500> string<00:02:42.740> as<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:43.010> did

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and then detuning the string as we did

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.630 
and then detuning the string as we did
before<00:02:43.280> by<00:02:43.580> reaching<00:02:43.820> over<00:02:44.360> we're<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.350> to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
before by reaching over we're going to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.180 
before by reaching over we're going to
achieve<00:02:46.640> drop<00:02:47.710> drop<00:02:48.710> D<00:02:49.250> tuning<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:50.240> way<00:02:50.420> so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
achieve drop drop D tuning that way so

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.180 
achieve drop drop D tuning that way so
there's<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> open<00:02:52.550> D<00:02:52.700> string<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:54.770> can<00:02:54.950> hear

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
there's the open D string you can hear

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.440 
there's the open D string you can hear
they're<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.400> right

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.210 

slightly<00:03:02.450> flat<00:03:04.000> again<00:03:05.410> we've<00:03:06.410> got<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> drop<00:03:07.040> D

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
slightly flat again we've got a drop D

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.490 
slightly flat again we've got a drop D
tuning<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.819> way<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:10.990> quick<00:03:11.990> summary<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.380> what

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
tuning that way a quick summary of what

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.750 
tuning that way a quick summary of what
we<00:03:12.590> just<00:03:12.620> looked<00:03:12.890> at<00:03:13.130> with<00:03:13.310> drop<00:03:13.550> D<00:03:13.730> tuning

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
we just looked at with drop D tuning

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.230 
we just looked at with drop D tuning
with<00:03:14.630> two<00:03:14.840> methods<00:03:15.290> method<00:03:16.070> one<00:03:16.280> we<00:03:16.730> fret<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
with two methods method one we fret the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.930 
with two methods method one we fret the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
sound the open a string then you d tune

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400 
sound the open a string then you d tune
the<00:03:22.820> E<00:03:22.850> string<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.480> open<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.900> string
