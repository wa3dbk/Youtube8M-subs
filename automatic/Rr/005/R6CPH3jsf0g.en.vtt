so last week I posted a video blog about
strum<00:00:41.280> bowing<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.450> remember<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> may

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
strum bowing and you remember you may

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660 
strum bowing and you remember you may
remember<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.770> spoke<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
remember that I spoke about the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.950 
remember that I spoke about the
horizontal<00:00:46.430> strum<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.210> basically<00:00:48.780> like

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
horizontal strum which is basically like

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
horizontal strum which is basically like
a<00:00:48.989> shuffle<00:00:53.180> or<00:00:54.180> de<00:00:54.930> cachet<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a shuffle or de cachet if you are a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.799 
a shuffle or de cachet if you are a
classical<00:00:56.969> player<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:59.550> vertical<00:01:00.180> axis

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
classical player and the vertical axis

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
classical player and the vertical axis
the<00:01:01.079> vertical<00:01:01.230> strong<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:03.949> like<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the vertical strong I like I use that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
the vertical strong I like I use that
rhythm<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.180> used<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> last<00:01:06.540> week<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.170> it's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
rhythm I used it last week I think it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
rhythm I used it last week I think it's
just<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> random<00:01:07.890> rhythm<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> tend

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just kind of a random rhythm that I tend

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
just kind of a random rhythm that I tend
to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> Bo<00:01:10.350> Diddley<00:01:10.380> New<00:01:10.920> Orleans

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to do is like the Bo Diddley New Orleans

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
to do is like the Bo Diddley New Orleans
kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.119> groove<00:01:12.530> anyway<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> could<00:01:13.680> be

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
kind of groove anyway it could be

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
kind of groove anyway it could be
anything<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:17.220> wanted<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
anything but I wanted to get just a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.780 
anything but I wanted to get just a
little<00:01:18.330> deeper<00:01:18.840> today<00:01:19.110> into<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.130> vertical

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
little deeper today into this vertical

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.390 
little deeper today into this vertical
thing<00:01:21.299> since<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> foreign<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
thing since that's kind of foreign to a
lot<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> players<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.659> also<00:01:24.869> known<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.380> the
