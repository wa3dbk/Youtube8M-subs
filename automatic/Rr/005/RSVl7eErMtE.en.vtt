00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.220
 who likes to travel a lot but this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.010
 marplatense family takes that interest to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.499
 an unthinkable extreme thinks about starting 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.079
 in a motorhome a trip that will last 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:16.700
 about a decade and it will allow them 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.800
 meet 110 countries on five continents 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.150
 a challenge not 15 years ago 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.180
 about I proposed to make carla 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 a round the world in family and in a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 motorhome and he did not say no to me so in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.289
 that moment began story three 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 five years planning a trip is much 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:40.050
 clear weather it is a journey of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.680
 three hundred thousand kilometers and there are there 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.360
 many things to plan 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.150
 and we were following others 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 travelers through the internet to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.990
 build this story 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.270
 this during these 15 years 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.190
 We were following the travelers and I accepted 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.440
 we bought them the vehicle we sold the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.170
 home and we start to build the right thing 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.220
 for such a long trip how many are from 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 family we are six this one carla my wife 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.620
 and two males 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.540
 patricio and fabricio and two women lara and 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.270
 Ornella and as the principle of 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 coexistence in the motorhome and good as 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.990
 a house or first we are 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.970
 we have to adapt because we sold the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.550
 house we went rent a house more 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.670
 girl while we build the motorhome 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.700
 and this as we go with a common dream 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.390
 I do not have that there are not sometimes arguments 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.580
 but this is very nice to be fulfilling 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.830
 a family dream as is the theme of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.640
 handle the only one who manages his voice does not 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.040
 Carla drives us and I carla is 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 learning because with these 12 meters and 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.090
 medium 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.490
 the 20 tons this one has to learn to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.280
 handle again but when we came 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.770
 for here he started driving on the route that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.860
 you have already taken out your professional record 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.019
 because for this it requires professional and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 what will be the destiny of when 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.790
 they came from where and what will be the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.650
 destinations good we the last dwelling 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.709
 fixed was in ezeiza 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.840
 end of May we got on the vehicle and 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.170
 We made a farewell to June 3 in 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 capital and we were adapting some 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 things some adjustments and the date that I already 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.810
 we left that we went to san nicolÃ¡s 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.659
 as the first destination after we made this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.790
 Uruguay and we returned was on August 23 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.040
 this year we are going to do all 5 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.230
 continents even now we are seeing 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.739
 from there to get to Antarctica 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.739
 Argentina 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.480
 the trip will be between seven to ten 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.430
 years 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.680
 the trip is called round the world in 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.890
 80 months but it's because of the July issue 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.319
 verne the we calculate that it will be more 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.260
 close to 10 years with respect to 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.900
 works of you as they did good 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.560
 the works were left remaining in place 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.359
 fixed and we are doing 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 different things to finance it for 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.760
 For example, we exchanged T-shirts for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.549
 kilometers of travel will be a value to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.099
 kilometers we are going east selling the in 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.409
 the road by kilometers traveled 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.840
 then we have spaces in the micro that 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.930
 we leave for advertising and in addition 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.819
 we make web pages or we are looking for 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.799
 different ways to finance us the 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.260
 guys with school the guys with the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.870
 school they go with an education plan to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.780
 distance from the Argentine air force and 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.230
 also on our behalf we want that 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.090
 both we and they learn 5 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.310
 Languages English French Portuguese 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.740
 Italian and German 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.760
 a dream that begins to materialize 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.760
 and the dream have been seen
