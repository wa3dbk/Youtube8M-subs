00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
okay that's what I mean really been

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
okay that's what I mean really been
working<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.000> first<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> basic

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
working on so first this is the basic

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.520 
working on so first this is the basic
easy<00:00:37.410> setup<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> head<00:00:38.430> kick<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:39.530> good

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
easy setup to the head kick now good

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.569 
easy setup to the head kick now good
head<00:00:40.739> kick<00:00:40.980> should<00:00:41.160> come<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.809> down<00:00:43.579> over

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
head kick should come up and down over

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
head kick should come up and down over
the<00:00:44.700> net<00:00:44.910> over<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> job<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.809> we're<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.079> taking

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the net over the job so we're not taking

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
the net over the job so we're not taking
it<00:00:46.500> upward<00:00:47.010> angle<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.420> easier

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it upward angle it's a little bit easier

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.549 
it upward angle it's a little bit easier
to<00:00:48.660> defend<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> drill<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.250> head<00:00:50.489> kick<00:00:51.559> it

comes<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> bring<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> weight<00:00:55.320> down

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
comes up and I bring the weight down

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
comes up and I bring the weight down

okay so what I'm going to do is this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
okay so what I'm going to do is this
kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> reaction<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:58.890> opponent<00:00:59.420> drop<00:01:00.420> the
