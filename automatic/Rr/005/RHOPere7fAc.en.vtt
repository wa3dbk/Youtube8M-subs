00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.500
 hi friends today we are going to prepare a flan 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.120
 of coconut for this we need the 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 following ingredients that jump more or 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.070
 less for 8 people well first that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.500
 nothing we are going to make the candy that is the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.690
 bottom part of the flan we will put the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.080
 sugar and a splash of water 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.280
 and we'll leave it to be on medium heat 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.770
 stirring from time to time while 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.310
 we prepare the flan we will put the 5 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.950
 eggs then we will put the coconut milk 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.989
 from the same container and give a few taps 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.880
 because it is what is the concentrate of 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.700
 the milk below we will also put the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 sugar and we will start to beat for 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.140
 mix what is the egg and the milk of 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.230
 coconut with sugar 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.720
 well mixed while candy as 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.329
 will start to boil so little to 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.620
 little will get gold too 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.469
 we will mix the grated coconut 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.300
 to move the candy once in a while 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.430
 that you do not forget because like you 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.040
 that I will remain bitter and beige 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.530
 in a moment it is ready we will put it in 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.060
 the mold we will put it with the part of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.290
 below and we will move it to cover what 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.240
 is the base of the mold then we will put 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.780
 very carefully the mixture that we have 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.759
 prepared and leave it in a bowl over 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 big to do it in the bain-marie 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.520
 we will put some water and nothing what 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.759
 We will leave in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.119
 for 40 or 60 minutes since the milk 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.440
 of coconut takes a little longer to become 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.289
 so nothing past this time what 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 we will let cool and as you see with a 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.780
 little knife we ​​took off and you 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.360
 we put a plate we turn them over and that's it 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.220
 It's super simple and super easy if you do not 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.560
 you do is because you do not want is very 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.920
 good for people that you like the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.750
 coconut is exquisite and later on 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.340
