that<00:02:13.959> no<00:02:14.380> people<00:02:15.250> saw<00:02:15.400> me<00:02:15.430> get<00:02:15.670> hit<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:15.849> some

hard<00:02:16.150> shots<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.830> he<00:02:17.950> hurt<00:02:17.980> me<00:02:18.220> that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
hard shots not that that he hurt me that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.500 
hard shots not that that he hurt me that
much<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.700> they<00:02:18.819> see<00:02:18.970> me<00:02:19.090> get<00:02:19.180> hit<00:02:19.300> with<00:02:19.390> some

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510

now<00:04:33.190> right<00:04:33.850> now<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.030> think<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.720> can't<00:04:35.050> really

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
now right now I think you can't really

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.530 
now right now I think you can't really
move<00:04:35.410> up<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:36.010> heavyweight<00:04:36.280> those<00:04:37.150> guys<00:04:37.360> are

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
move up to heavyweight those guys are

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.559 
move up to heavyweight those guys are
too<00:04:37.660> big<00:04:37.870> light<00:04:38.200> hit

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
too big light hit

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.100 
too big light hit
cruiserweight<00:04:39.050> perhaps<00:04:39.619> but<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:39.889> think<00:04:40.189> no<00:04:41.110> you

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
cruiserweight perhaps but I think no you

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.159 
cruiserweight perhaps but I think no you
can<00:04:42.229> go<00:04:42.259> up<00:04:42.439> to<00:04:42.529> heavyweight<00:04:43.059> okay<00:04:44.059> well<00:04:44.270> what

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
can go up to heavyweight okay well what

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.989 
can go up to heavyweight okay well what
we'll<00:04:45.469> get<00:04:45.589> to<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.740> then<00:04:45.860> but<00:04:46.399> I<00:04:46.429> just<00:04:46.909> think

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:46.999 
we'll get to that then but I just think

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.839 
we'll get to that then but I just think
being<00:04:47.689> a<00:04:47.809> dominant<00:04:48.139> light<00:04:48.979> heavyweight<00:04:49.459> is

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849
