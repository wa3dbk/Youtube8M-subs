00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
think a bhutto technique it's just a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.609 
think a bhutto technique it's just a
medium<00:01:38.569> to<00:01:39.530> an<00:01:39.679> end<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.190> no<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.119> N<00:01:41.299> itself<00:01:41.929> the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
medium to an end and no the N itself the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.090 
medium to an end and no the N itself the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.600 

the<00:04:39.940> concept<00:04:40.450> behind<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:41.110> piece

floating-point<00:04:42.610> waves<00:04:43.180> as<00:04:43.770> everything<00:04:44.770> is

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
floating-point waves as everything is

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.950 
floating-point waves as everything is
moving<00:04:45.250> all<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.610> time<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.420> want<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.900> make

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
moving all the time and we want to make

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.080 
moving all the time and we want to make
things<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.530> table<00:04:48.010> we<00:04:48.280> want<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.670> like<00:04:48.820> graph

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
things as table we want to like graph

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.270 
things as table we want to like graph
things<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.570> make<00:04:49.750> things<00:04:49.780> safe<00:04:50.290> but<00:04:51.070> that's

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
things and make things safe but that's

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.220 
things and make things safe but that's
not<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.610> world<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.360> world<00:04:52.630> is<00:04:52.750> really<00:04:53.080> moving

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
not the world the world is really moving

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.370 
not the world the world is really moving
and<00:04:54.010> idea<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.460> things<00:04:55.090> constantly<00:04:55.660> shifting

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
and idea of things constantly shifting

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.540 
and idea of things constantly shifting
and<00:04:56.940> one<00:04:57.940> action<00:04:58.510> has<00:04:59.200> so<00:04:59.560> many<00:04:59.680> consequences

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
and one action has so many consequences

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.120 
and one action has so many consequences
because<00:05:01.000> everything<00:05:01.540> is<00:05:01.660> connected<00:05:02.020> so<00:05:02.470> if<00:05:02.740> I

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
because everything is connected so if I

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.960 
because everything is connected so if I
I<00:05:03.790> throw<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.540> little<00:05:04.860> pebble<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.040> water<00:05:06.400> it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
I throw a little pebble in the water it

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.510 
I throw a little pebble in the water it
will<00:05:07.180> make<00:05:07.210> ripples<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.220> that's<00:05:09.220> what

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
will make ripples and that's what

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.300 
will make ripples and that's what
everything<00:05:10.150> we<00:05:10.300> do<00:05:10.510> does<00:05:10.780> make<00:05:11.230> ripples

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.380
