00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770 
about it when I went down to the

showroom and played these things man it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
showroom and played these things man it
was<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.140> easy<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.440> pull<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.390> these<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.630> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
was so easy to pull this these are just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.740 
was so easy to pull this these are just
the<00:01:58.290> exception<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.759> rule<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the exception to the rule and that you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
the exception to the rule and that you
know<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:01.350> play<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:02.100> well<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.550> action

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
know they play very well the action

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.430 
know they play very well the action
doesn't<00:02:03.300> just<00:02:03.630> stop<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.080> dead<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.410> your

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
doesn't just stop you dead in your

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.260 
doesn't just stop you dead in your
tracks<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.280> around<00:02:05.550> on<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
tracks you can get around on it really

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.710 
tracks you can get around on it really
really<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:08.100> then<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.459> also<00:02:08.610> sounds<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
really well but then it also sounds so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.949 
really well but then it also sounds so
good<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.580> with<00:02:12.360> acoustics<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
good and so I think with acoustics in

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.960 
good and so I think with acoustics in
general<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.410> most<00:02:13.769> especially<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.549> 12

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
general but most especially with 12

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.670 
general but most especially with 12
strings<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:16.019> tough<00:02:16.470> act<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
strings that's a tough act to to make to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.009 
strings that's a tough act to to make to
a<00:02:19.709> sit<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.250> know<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.549> mean<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.019> they

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
a sit you know what I mean and they

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.690 
a sit you know what I mean and they
based<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> best<00:02:23.010> 12<00:02:23.310> string<00:02:23.549> I've

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
based it this is the best 12 string I've

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.710
