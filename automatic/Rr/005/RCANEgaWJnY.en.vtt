hi<00:00:01.050> gbg<00:00:01.560> cuts<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.399> an<00:00:02.580> suresh

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi gbg cuts here this is an suresh

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.820 
hi gbg cuts here this is an suresh
prototype<00:00:03.389> off<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.629> few<00:00:03.840> keys<00:00:04.049> ba<00:00:04.259> factory<00:00:04.650> that

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
prototype off a few keys ba factory that

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.970 
prototype off a few keys ba factory that
made<00:00:05.009> it's<00:00:05.580> about<00:00:05.790> half<00:00:06.120> done<00:00:06.680> here's<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.830> big

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
made it's about half done here's the big

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.950 
made it's about half done here's the big
view<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.370> middle<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:12.210> mechanism<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
view in the middle the mechanism that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.519 
view in the middle the mechanism that
turns<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> wheel<00:00:14.240> this<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.509> unloads<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
turns the wheel this one unloads the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
turns the wheel this one unloads the
buckets<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.550> big<00:00:18.510> wheel<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:20.660> puts<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
buckets from the big wheel and puts it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.400 
buckets from the big wheel and puts it
on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> conveyor<00:00:22.529> belt<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> friction<00:00:25.170> each

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
on the conveyor belt the friction each

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.220 
on the conveyor belt the friction each
of<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.800> mechanisms<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:26.939> large<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
of these mechanisms is very large so it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
of these mechanisms is very large so it
is<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.680> difficult<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.189> run<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> whole

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is very difficult to run the whole

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
is very difficult to run the whole
module<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.269> high<00:00:30.420> speeds<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.990> managed<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
module at high speeds I managed to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.880 
module at high speeds I managed to
reduce<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.180> friction<00:00:33.410> such<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
reduce some of the friction such that I

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.630 
reduce some of the friction such that I
can<00:00:35.070> easily<00:00:35.280> turn<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> crankshaft<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.600> shown

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
can easily turn the crankshaft as shown

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.500 
can easily turn the crankshaft as shown
this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> incomplete<00:00:39.329> by<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> I'll<00:00:45.210> stop

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
this is incomplete by way so I'll stop

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
this is incomplete by way so I'll stop
talking<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.050> show<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> parts<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
talking now and show you the parts of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:35.450 
talking now and show you the parts of
the<00:00:47.129> module<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.879> finished

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.520 

and<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.350> wheel<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.620> place

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.169 

so<00:01:46.530> yeah<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.429> I<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.969> finish

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
so yeah that's about it I will finish

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.169 
so yeah that's about it I will finish
this<00:01:48.509> module<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.259> six<00:01:49.740> months<00:01:50.250> Etta<00:01:50.429> as<00:01:50.850> I've

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
this module in six months Etta as I've

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.260 
this module in six months Etta as I've
an<00:01:51.570> important<00:01:52.229> exam<00:01:52.590> coming<00:01:52.859> up<00:01:53.119> remember<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
an important exam coming up remember to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.419 
an important exam coming up remember to
