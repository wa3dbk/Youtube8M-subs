the contest again with the lift of the
shoes<00:03:27.590> off<00:03:27.769> we<00:03:27.950> could<00:03:28.069> see<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.819> difference<00:03:28.870> in

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
shoes off we could see the difference in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.750 
shoes off we could see the difference in
the<00:03:30.560> shoe<00:03:30.799> lift<00:03:31.220> sighs<00:03:31.519> there<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.420> right<00:03:32.569> so

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
the shoe lift sighs there all right so

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.940 
the shoe lift sighs there all right so
go<00:03:34.760> ahead<00:03:34.819> again<00:03:35.180> cross<00:03:35.720> your<00:03:35.900> arms<00:03:36.110> eyes<00:03:36.560> open

go ahead again cross your arms eyes open
start<00:03:37.280> marching<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.670> place<00:03:39.700> all<00:03:40.700> right<00:03:40.910> and

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
start marching in place all right and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.360 
start marching in place all right and
eyes<00:03:41.900> closed<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:45.829> could<00:03:46.099> see<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
eyes closed so now we could see the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.780 
eyes closed so now we could see the
deviation<00:03:47.290> well<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.980> Illinois<00:03:49.370> internal

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
deviation well in the Illinois internal

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.400 
deviation well in the Illinois internal
room<00:03:49.910> yeah<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:50.420> not<00:03:50.630> much<00:03:50.810> internal<00:03:51.170> rotation

than<00:03:56.000> she's<00:03:56.269> ever<00:03:56.450> done<00:03:56.660> awesome<00:03:58.810> okay<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.760> now

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
than she's ever done awesome okay so now

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.119 
than she's ever done awesome okay so now
when<00:04:02.299> we<00:04:02.329> look<00:04:02.629> at<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.870> brain<00:04:03.110> Kaylee<00:04:03.950> we've

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
when we look at the brain Kaylee we've

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.360 
when we look at the brain Kaylee we've
got<00:04:04.310> different<00:04:04.610> parts<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.360> we<00:04:05.870> have<00:04:06.370> parts

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
got different parts of it we have parts

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.430 
got different parts of it we have parts
that<00:04:07.519> sit<00:04:07.760> down<00:04:08.000> here<00:04:08.360> in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> back<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.079> it's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
that sit down here in the back and it's

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680 
that sit down here in the back and it's
call<00:04:09.620> your<00:04:09.739> cerebellum<00:04:10.250> okay<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.329> remember

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
call your cerebellum okay and remember

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.180 
call your cerebellum okay and remember
when<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.870> had<00:04:12.049> your<00:04:12.200> arm<00:04:12.379> up<00:04:12.530> like<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.130> I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
when I had your arm up like this and I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.330 
when I had your arm up like this and I
said<00:04:13.250> resist<00:04:13.819> as<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.060> push<00:04:14.269> down<00:04:14.299> hold

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
said resist as I push down hold

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.099 
said resist as I push down hold
that's<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.639> cerebellar<00:04:17.209> response<00:04:17.720> when<00:04:17.989> you

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
that's a cerebellar response when you

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.050 
that's a cerebellar response when you
resist<00:04:18.470> hold<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.489> signal<00:04:19.880> which

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
resist hold it's in the signal which

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
resist hold it's in the signal which
tells<00:04:20.359> your<00:04:20.539> body<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.989> make<00:04:21.169> this<00:04:21.350> muscles

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
tells your body to make this muscles

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.210 
tells your body to make this muscles
strong<00:04:22.160> okay<00:04:22.639> now<00:04:23.479> on<00:04:23.840> top<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.919> there's

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
strong okay now on top of that there's

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.770 
strong okay now on top of that there's
this<00:04:25.340> little<00:04:25.490> tent<00:04:25.849> and<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.210> divider<00:04:26.539> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
this little tent and a divider and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.990 
this little tent and a divider and
there's<00:04:27.289> two<00:04:27.620> halves<00:04:28.099> on<00:04:28.340> each<00:04:28.460> side<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.880> know

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
there's two halves on each side you know

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.700 
there's two halves on each side you know
you<00:04:29.030> have<00:04:29.240> one<00:04:29.479> side<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.990> brain<00:04:30.169> controls<00:04:30.530> one

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
you have one side of brain controls one

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.310 
you have one side of brain controls one
side<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.039> body<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.490> opposite<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.200> is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
side of body and opposite and this is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.529 
side of body and opposite and this is
called<00:04:33.560> your<00:04:33.620> cerebral<00:04:34.460> cortex<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.180> that's

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
called your cerebral cortex and that's

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.940 
called your cerebral cortex and that's
the<00:04:35.780> part<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.260> were<00:04:36.380> testing<00:04:36.770> when<00:04:36.889> I

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
the part that we were testing when I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.070 
the part that we were testing when I
said<00:04:37.160> hold<00:04:37.340> your<00:04:37.400> arm<00:04:37.610> up<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:37.940> bite<00:04:38.539> down<00:04:38.810> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
said hold your arm up and bite down and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.680 
said hold your arm up and bite down and
push<00:04:39.740> up<00:04:39.770> into<00:04:40.070> my<00:04:40.190> hand<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.669> there's<00:04:41.419> nothing

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
push up into my hand and there's nothing

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.810 
push up into my hand and there's nothing
there<00:04:41.840> now<00:04:42.349> relax<00:04:42.650> your<00:04:42.860> jaw<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.400> push<00:04:43.669> up

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
there now relax your jaw and push up

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.570 
there now relax your jaw and push up
into<00:04:44.000> my<00:04:44.090> hand<00:04:44.270> real<00:04:44.539> hard<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.889> it's<00:04:46.130> nice<00:04:46.340> and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
into my hand real hard and it's nice and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.360 
into my hand real hard and it's nice and
strong<00:04:46.849> there<00:04:47.150> that's<00:04:47.810> because<00:04:48.370> when

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
strong there that's because when

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.460 
strong there that's because when
compression<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.150> affecting<00:04:50.660> frontal

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
compression is affecting frontal

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.740 
compression is affecting frontal
cerebral<00:04:52.099> cortex<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.669> have<00:04:53.090> lack<00:04:53.479> of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
cerebral cortex you have lack of

cerebral cortex you have lack of
initiation<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.440> motor<00:04:54.620> movement<00:04:55.039> when<00:04:55.430> you

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
initiation of motor movement when you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.990 
initiation of motor movement when you
bite<00:04:55.729> down

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
bite down

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.270 
bite down
that's<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:56.780> cranial<00:04:57.380> dental<00:04:57.770> compression

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
that's that cranial dental compression

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
that's that cranial dental compression
that<00:04:58.370> we're<00:04:58.490> going<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.669> evaluate<00:04:58.849> with<00:04:59.210> the

that we're going to evaluate with the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.680 
that we're going to evaluate with the
eye<00:04:59.330> can<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.200> dentist<00:05:00.560> look<00:05:00.740> at<00:05:00.889> so<00:05:01.849> we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
eye can have the dentist look at so we

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.930 
eye can have the dentist look at so we
were<00:05:02.780> just<00:05:02.960> stimulating<00:05:03.470> was<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.370> right<00:05:04.639> part

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
were just stimulating was the right part

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.089 
were just stimulating was the right part
of<00:05:05.030> your<00:05:05.380> cerebellum<00:05:06.410> that's<00:05:06.770> the

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
of your cerebellum that's the

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.400 
of your cerebellum that's the
reactionary<00:05:07.880> force<00:05:08.240> we<00:05:08.870> did<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.229> by

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
reactionary force we did that by

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.900 
reactionary force we did that by
stimulating<00:05:09.680> your<00:05:10.099> eyes<00:05:10.220> when<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.610> turn<00:05:10.789> your

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
stimulating your eyes when you turn your

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.490 
stimulating your eyes when you turn your
head<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.330> that<00:05:12.110> helped<00:05:12.740> too

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
head and that helped too

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.620 
head and that helped too
balanced<00:05:13.860> yeah<00:05:14.010> when<00:05:14.400> you're<00:05:14.550> walking<00:05:14.730> now

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
balanced yeah when you're walking now

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.540 
balanced yeah when you're walking now
don't<00:05:16.290> go<00:05:16.410> doing<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.830> exercise<00:05:17.040> all<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
don't go doing that exercise all the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.220 
don't go doing that exercise all the
time<00:05:17.730> yet<00:05:17.940> until<00:05:18.210> we<00:05:18.300> see<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.540> changes<00:05:18.930> okay

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
time yet until we see the changes okay

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.500 
time yet until we see the changes okay
and<00:05:19.920> then<00:05:20.250> we'll<00:05:20.370> figure<00:05:20.550> out<00:05:20.700> how<00:05:20.910> often<00:05:21.150> if

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
and then we'll figure out how often if

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.550 
and then we'll figure out how often if
necessary<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:22.290> need<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.530> do<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.830> all<00:05:23.490> right
