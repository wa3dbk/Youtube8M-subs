with my ring finger and at the same time

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.580 
with my ring finger and at the same time
I'm<00:04:08.150> hammering<00:04:08.540> with<00:04:08.690> my<00:04:08.900> middle<00:04:09.230> finger<00:04:09.560> so

I'm hammering with my middle finger so

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.140 
I'm hammering with my middle finger so
the<00:04:09.920> ring<00:04:10.100> finger<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.430> going<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:10.970> 9th

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the ring finger is going to the 9th

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.610 
the ring finger is going to the 9th
middle<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.200> going<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.769> 8th<00:04:13.360> but<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.660> pick

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
middle is going to the 8th but I pick

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.689 
middle is going to the 8th but I pick
the<00:04:16.010> D<00:04:16.190> string<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.880> then<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.780> picked<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.260> B

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.310 
the D string and then I picked the B
and<00:04:20.269> then<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.479> pull<00:04:20.659> them<00:04:20.749> both<00:04:20.900> off

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.990 

so

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.779 

so<00:04:34.000> after<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.539> pull<00:04:34.780> off<00:04:35.520> you're<00:04:36.520> going<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.669> go

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
so after you pull off you're going to go

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.520 
so after you pull off you're going to go
back<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.150> pick<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.449> four<00:04:37.660> string<00:04:37.990> again

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.890 

to<00:04:46.330> an<00:04:46.510> a5<00:04:46.840> chord<00:04:47.970> do<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.090> same<00:04:49.270> riff<00:04:49.510> again

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.550 

but<00:04:53.530> then<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.770> second<00:04:54.160> time<00:04:55.170> open<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.440> D

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
but then the second time open a and D

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.360 
but then the second time open a and D
which<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.920> like<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.070> d5<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:59.500> bard<00:04:59.710> at<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.950> second

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
which is like a d5 to bard at the second

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.480 
which is like a d5 to bard at the second
fret<00:05:00.610> it's<00:05:00.880> like<00:05:01.000> an<00:05:01.120> e5
