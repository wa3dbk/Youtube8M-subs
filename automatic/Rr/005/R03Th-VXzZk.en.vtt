one<00:01:47.080> clicks<00:01:47.409> like<00:01:47.650> my<00:01:47.799> old<00:01:47.950> mouse<00:01:48.159> but<00:01:48.520> you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
one clicks like my old mouse but you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.760 
one clicks like my old mouse but you
know<00:01:48.909> we're<00:01:49.090> gonna<00:01:49.210> do<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:50.020> finally<00:01:50.530> we<00:01:50.650> have

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
know we're gonna do and finally we have

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.620 
know we're gonna do and finally we have
the<00:01:50.799> nano<00:01:51.040> receiver<00:01:51.220> itself<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.210> let's<00:01:52.390> jump

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the nano receiver itself so let's jump

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.940 
the nano receiver itself so let's jump
right<00:01:52.690> into<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.350> show<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.619> but<00:01:53.770> his

right into it and show up but his

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.609 
right into it and show up but his
keyboard<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.549> actually<00:01:54.880> do<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.300> LCD<00:01:55.869> just

neat next I'm going to show you
something<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:11.709> perhaps<00:02:11.890> from<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
something that we perhaps from the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.370 
something that we perhaps from the
computer<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.480> look<00:02:13.750> at<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.170> actual

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
computer this is a look at the actual

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
software that comes with you can change

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.750 
software that comes with you can change
all<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> colors<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.470> backlighting<00:02:18.040> from

all the colors of the backlighting from

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.240 
all the colors of the backlighting from
just<00:02:19.660> about<00:02:19.870> any<00:02:20.170> kind<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.530> color<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.890> want<00:02:21.130> as

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
just about any kind of color you want as

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.370 
just about any kind of color you want as
you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.760> mean<00:02:22.060> any<00:02:22.390> color<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.260> can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
you can see I mean any color you can

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
you can see I mean any color you can
think<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.250> set<00:02:24.519> as<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> macro<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.209> you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
think of you can set as a macro and you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.229 
think of you can set as a macro and you
get<00:02:25.510> three<00:02:25.840> functions<00:02:26.320> for<00:02:26.560> each<00:02:26.590> set<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.250> a

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
get three functions for each set of a

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.300 
get three functions for each set of a
team<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.140> would<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.620> have<00:02:29.769> while

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
team that you would like to have while

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.979 
team that you would like to have while
it<00:02:30.489> only<00:02:30.610> has<00:02:30.850> really<00:02:31.239> one<00:02:31.390> function<00:02:31.870> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
it only has really one function and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.540 
it only has really one function and
that's<00:02:32.110> aesthetics<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.160> was<00:02:33.310> my

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
that's aesthetics this really was my

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.190 
that's aesthetics this really was my
favorite<00:02:33.880> part<00:02:34.060> about<00:02:34.150> two<00:02:34.570> words<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:35.019> how

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
favorite part about two words just how

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.350 
favorite part about two words just how
customized<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> backlighting<00:02:36.820> was<00:02:37.120> on

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
customized for the backlighting was on

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.630 
customized for the backlighting was on
the<00:02:37.810> keys<00:02:38.050> itself<00:02:38.590> logitech<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.220> made<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.459> just

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the keys itself logitech is made it just

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.370 
the keys itself logitech is made it just
as<00:02:39.760> easy<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.000> change<00:02:40.269> your<00:02:40.510> macros<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> is

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
as easy to change your macros as it is

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.410 
as easy to change your macros as it is
backlighting<00:02:42.070> with<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> program<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:43.269> you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
backlighting with the program all you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
backlighting with the program all you
really<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.200> click<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.620> key

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
really have to do is click on the key

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.040 
really have to do is click on the key
set<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> exactly<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.600> want<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.959> do

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
set it to exactly what you want is to do

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.229 
set it to exactly what you want is to do
when<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> hit<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:48.640> create<00:02:48.940> like

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
when you hit it and you can create like

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.030 
when you hit it and you can create like
simple<00:02:49.600> macro<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.959> step<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.319> web<00:02:50.440> browsers<00:02:50.470> and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
simple macro to step in web browsers and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.289 
simple macro to step in web browsers and
so<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.730> sure<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.090> SAT

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
so like that but I'm sure if you SAT

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.610 
so like that but I'm sure if you SAT
around<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.630> play<00:02:52.810> with<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.260> create

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
around and play with it you can create

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.170 
around and play with it you can create
really<00:02:54.010> cool<00:02:54.220> macros<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.610> set<00:02:54.850> your<00:02:54.970> games

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
really cool macros and set your games

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.160 
really cool macros and set your games
especially<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.870> your<00:02:55.989> RT<00:02:56.260> SS<00:02:56.410> out<00:02:56.709> there

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.740 

and<00:03:01.209> finally<00:03:02.209> we're<00:03:02.300> going<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.510> talk<00:03:02.630> about

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and finally we're going to talk about

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.740 
and finally we're going to talk about
the<00:03:02.840> g7<00:03:03.500> s<00:03:03.709> as<00:03:04.069> i<00:03:04.459> said<00:03:04.640> before<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.090> has<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> lot

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the g7 s as i said before it has a lot

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.920 
the g7 s as i said before it has a lot
of<00:03:05.780> macros<00:03:06.260> 13<00:03:06.950> programmable<00:03:07.670> controls<00:03:08.120> for

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
of macros 13 programmable controls for

of macros 13 programmable controls for
which<00:03:09.230> looked<00:03:09.560> at<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.040> film<00:03:10.310> there's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
which looked at that the film there's

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.400 
which looked at that the film there's
some<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.180> index<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.080> rest<00:03:12.230> soon
