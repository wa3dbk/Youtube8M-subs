00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
this concept video said when the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.840 
this concept video said when the
customer<00:02:21.120> want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.540> put<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.830> table<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
customer want to put on the table the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.260 
customer want to put on the table the
studs<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.870> found<00:02:25.290> under<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.550> put<00:02:26.790> on

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
studs can go found under we can put on

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.040 
studs can go found under we can put on
the<00:02:27.390> shape<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.870> changed<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:30.050> this

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the shape is changed but actually this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.860 
the shape is changed but actually this
is<00:02:31.230> concept<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.070> actually<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:33.330> technical

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
is concept so actually the technical

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.200 
is concept so actually the technical
point<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.260> view<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.100> little<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.460> tip<00:02:35.700> too

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
point of view it's a little bit tip too

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.600 
point of view it's a little bit tip too
much<00:02:36.420> otherwise<00:02:36.750> feels<00:02:37.620> very<00:02:37.890> good<00:02:38.130> yeah<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
much otherwise feels very good yeah you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.100 
much otherwise feels very good yeah you
mentioned<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.090> obviously<00:02:39.480> from<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
mentioned that obviously from like a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.840 
mentioned that obviously from like a
technical<00:02:40.920> point<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.160> view<00:02:41.220> you're<00:02:41.460> from<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
technical point of view you're from the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.660 
technical point of view you're from the
design<00:02:42.180> team<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.930> now<00:02:43.560> he's<00:02:43.800> from<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.460> actual

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
design team and now he's from the actual

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.640 
design team and now he's from the actual
engineering<00:02:45.060> team<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> ideas

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
engineering team so you have the ideas

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.170 
engineering team so you have the ideas
and<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:47.070> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.340> figure<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:47.880> right

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and they kind of figure it all out right

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.790 
and they kind of figure it all out right
right<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.910> me<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.480> realize<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.110> concept

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
right so to me to realize this concept

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.520 
right so to me to realize this concept
there<00:02:53.340> are<00:02:53.490> many<00:02:53.700> components<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.810> fish

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
there are many components to fish

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.030 
there are many components to fish
pudding<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.790> also<00:02:57.150> very<00:02:57.420> thin<00:02:57.720> body<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
pudding and also very thin body so to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
pudding and also very thin body so to
make<00:02:59.700> good<00:03:00.090> brightness<00:03:00.750> LCD<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:02.280> wrong

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
make good brightness LCD with wrong

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
make good brightness LCD with wrong
bacteria<00:03:03.540> right<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:04.260> example<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:04.890> very

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
bacteria right for example it's very

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.430 
bacteria right for example it's very
difficult<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.820> always<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.810> fighting<00:03:07.050> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
difficult so always we are fighting to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.930 
difficult so always we are fighting to
realize<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.370> idea<00:03:09.770> concept<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.400> always<00:03:11.790> we

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
realize the idea concept so always we

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.240 
realize the idea concept so always we
fight<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.230> are<00:03:13.440> studying<00:03:13.680> too

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
fight at it now we are studying too

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.520 
fight at it now we are studying too
pretty<00:03:14.610> others<00:03:14.940> these<00:03:15.270> products<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.350> then

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
pretty others these products so then

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.920 
pretty others these products so then
okay<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.100> mean<00:03:17.760> I've<00:03:17.880> looked<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.330> product

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
okay I mean I've looked at this product

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.740 
okay I mean I've looked at this product
like<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.230> see<00:03:19.520> there's<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> front<00:03:20.880> camera<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
like I see there's a front camera and a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.710 
like I see there's a front camera and a
back<00:03:21.959> camera<00:03:22.550> but<00:03:23.550> there's<00:03:23.730> no<00:03:23.850> USB<00:03:24.209> ports

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
back camera but there's no USB ports

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.070 
back camera but there's no USB ports
that<00:03:24.840> win<00:03:25.110> how<00:03:25.650> does<00:03:25.800> that<00:03:26.010> work<00:03:26.340> yeah<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.900> is

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
that win how does that work yeah this is

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.310 
that win how does that work yeah this is
just<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.590> concept<00:03:29.250> mock-up<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:30.930> have

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
just a concept mock-up so we don't have

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.250 
just a concept mock-up so we don't have
any<00:03:31.650> port<00:03:32.100> at<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.730> moment<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.930> course

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
any port at this moment but of course

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.350 
any port at this moment but of course
when<00:03:34.769> we<00:03:34.950> march<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:35.730> want<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.030> study

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
when we march on that we want to study

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.199 
when we march on that we want to study
about<00:03:36.810> them<00:03:37.050> one<00:03:37.830> tablets<00:03:38.340> run<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.700> android

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
about them one tablets run on android

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.020 
about them one tablets run on android
this<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:40.170> isn't<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.500> tablet<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.220> yeah

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
this is this isn't a tablet is it yeah

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.590 
this is this isn't a tablet is it yeah
this<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:44.010> concept<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.519> based<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.910> Phi<00:03:45.239> Phi

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
this is the concept is based on Phi Phi

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.550 
this is the concept is based on Phi Phi
oh<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.340> yeah<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:48.390> think<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.080> based<00:03:49.410> on

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
oh and yeah we think this is based on

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.250 
oh and yeah we think this is based on
Windows<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.630> moment<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:52.590> don't<00:03:53.310> have

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
Windows but at this moment we don't have

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.120 
Windows but at this moment we don't have
the<00:03:55.260> forest<00:03:56.040> buzzer<00:03:56.430> yet<00:03:57.769> okay<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:58.830> you're

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
the forest buzzer yet okay so you're

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.490 
the forest buzzer yet okay so you're
saying<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.519> because<00:04:00.480> it's<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
saying that because it's really a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.310 
saying that because it's really a
computing<00:04:02.430> system<00:04:02.670> yeah<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:03.750> better<00:04:04.230> on

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
computing system yeah it's better on

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.550 
computing system yeah it's better on
Windows<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.250> let's

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
Windows then let's

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.949 
Windows then let's
they<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.459> know<00:04:06.489> using<00:04:06.849> Android<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.840> know

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
they you know using Android for you know

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.330 
they you know using Android for you know
a<00:04:07.989> sony<00:04:08.319> power<00:04:08.860> yeah<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:10.090> we<00:04:10.500> want<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.560> focus<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
a sony power yeah so we want to focus on

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.390 
a sony power yeah so we want to focus on
more<00:04:12.520> productivity<00:04:13.470> that's<00:04:14.470> why<00:04:14.709> based<00:04:15.190> on

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
more productivity that's why based on

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.490 
more productivity that's why based on
windows<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.510> that's<00:04:16.720> why<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:17.049> prepare

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
windows so that's why we prepare

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.949 
windows so that's why we prepare
hardware<00:04:18.010> keyboard<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.090> easy<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.600> input

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
hardware keyboard and it's easy to input
