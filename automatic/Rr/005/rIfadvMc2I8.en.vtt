00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
Urban Decay Naked palette create my

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.729 
Urban Decay Naked palette create my
outer<00:00:33.470> V<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:34.360> chose<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.390> matte<00:00:35.780> medium<00:00:36.260> brown

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
outer V I chose a matte medium brown

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.950 
outer V I chose a matte medium brown
color<00:00:37.129> because<00:00:37.699> this<00:00:38.329> makes<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.720> really

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
color because this makes a really

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.490 
color because this makes a really
believable<00:00:39.530> contour<00:00:40.309> color<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:42.290> just

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
believable contour color so just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.270 
believable contour color so just
following<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.309> socket<00:00:44.829> really<00:00:45.829> press<00:00:46.129> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
following the socket really press the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
following the socket really press the
color<00:00:46.489> into<00:00:46.940> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 

it's<00:00:59.039> pretty<00:00:59.250> hard<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.989> someone<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.260> Asia

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's pretty hard for someone with Asia

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's pretty hard for someone with Asia
nice<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.840> socket<00:01:04.260> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
nice to do this because the socket is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.280 
nice to do this because the socket is
not<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.860> obvious<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> bring<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
not as obvious and I like to bring this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.180 
not as obvious and I like to bring this
color<00:01:07.560> towards<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> inner<00:01:08.610> corner<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.270> well

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
color towards the inner corner as well

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.140 
color towards the inner corner as well
to<00:01:11.190> add<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:11.520> dimension

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 

so<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.960> keep<00:01:19.140> blending<00:01:19.470> until<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.280> all

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
so just keep blending until you get all

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.670 
so just keep blending until you get all
the<00:01:20.550> harsh<00:01:20.820> edges<00:01:21.060> out

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.190 

next<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:28.760> going<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.180> go<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.540> with<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.020> regular

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

eyeshadow<00:01:30.680> brush<00:01:31.370> and<00:01:32.080> take<00:01:33.080> some<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.650> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
eyeshadow brush and take some of the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.710 
eyeshadow brush and take some of the
color<00:01:34.190> toasted<00:01:34.880> from<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> Naked<00:01:35.690> palette

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.830 

pressing<00:01:46.400> in<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.670> color<00:01:46.910> really<00:01:47.360> helps<00:01:47.690> to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
pressing in the color really helps to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:59.330 
pressing in the color really helps to
build<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.290> intensity<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.280> color

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.430 

you

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.570 

taking<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.500> pencil<00:02:04.800> brush<00:02:04.920> again<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.490> going

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
taking the pencil brush again I'm going

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.300 
taking the pencil brush again I'm going
to<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.600> color<00:02:06.780> hassle<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to go in with the color hassle and this

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.030 
to go in with the color hassle and this
will<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.760> redefine<00:02:09.540> our<00:02:09.840> V<00:02:10.170> shape<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.710> give

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
will just redefine our V shape and give

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.460 
will just redefine our V shape and give
it<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.700> dimension<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it a little more dimension so that it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.610 
it a little more dimension so that it
makes<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.860> believable<00:02:14.490> contour<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
makes a believable contour this is a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.760 
makes a believable contour this is a
darker<00:02:17.220> color<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.320> blend<00:02:19.590> in

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
darker color so it's going to blend in

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.820 
darker color so it's going to blend in
pretty<00:02:19.980> well<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.640> our<00:02:20.940> buck<00:02:27.380> here<00:02:28.380> i'm<00:02:28.530> just
