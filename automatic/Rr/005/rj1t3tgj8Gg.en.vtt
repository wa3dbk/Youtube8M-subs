here I'm gonna step out it might be a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.010 
here I'm gonna step out it might be a
bit<00:00:37.290> tricky<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.280> night<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.870> when<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
bit tricky to see at night here when you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.270 
bit tricky to see at night here when you
shut<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:44.840> probably<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.960> catch<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:49.219> see<00:00:50.219> if

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
shut it probably I can catch it see if

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
shut it probably I can catch it see if
you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:50.910> inside<00:00:52.100> ready<00:00:54.860> yeah

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you can get it from inside ready yeah

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.420 
you can get it from inside ready yeah
it's<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.879> small

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's very very small

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you can more so hear it than see it I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
you can more so hear it than see it I
guess<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.070> might<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.370> better<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
guess it might be a better thing for

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.300 
guess it might be a better thing for
