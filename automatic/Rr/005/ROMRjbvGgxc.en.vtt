00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
programs like mud box to get the base
down<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.860> use<00:00:50.070> substances<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.820> earth<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
down and then use substances on earth to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090 
down and then use substances on earth to
actually<00:00:51.449> bake<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> details<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> need

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
actually bake all the details and I need

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
actually bake all the details and I need
