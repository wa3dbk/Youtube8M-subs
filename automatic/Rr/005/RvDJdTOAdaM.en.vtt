00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.620
 and well hi everyone and yes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.310
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.320
 new episode of a weapon a 4th with 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.599
 the rxe 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 it seems to me that it was 160 something 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.449
 like that short so it does not matter what 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.660
 gameplay is located on the freight map 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.750
 a map a snowy terrain and with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.640
 big big tops and as has when 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 even stones confess I'm not going 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 put the gameplay in full I 'm going 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.140
 you put that series to the rx because 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.019
 that after this series I was trying a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 cream to the old father and I have a little 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.280
 idea I looked at the hunger score I got 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.470
 am saying yeah anyway it's a big 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.440
 score for this card is all with a 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.960
 sm runs so I'm going to burst on my 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.979
 youtube channel that this video does 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 that is, what the klm sequence 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.479
 and gardens in not even and me or what 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.580
 when I have time and when the rage 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.190
 also have time I will lose you 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 full video on rabies and I think 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.480
 that I'm going to do the same for the video to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.020
 the old father so 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.300
 I cropped and she will also switch to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.580
 rabies finally on the chain of rabies 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.850
 so that's what I had to you 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.570
 say at the beginning so I will describe you 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.100
 my class 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 excuse me I win a little early 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.450
 so I will describe my class 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.900
 so I know that the fight with exo 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.060
 the silent azerty I had like a 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.920
 everything each time the same basic end 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.980
 loan and a loan tracker I forget 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.370
 so much I would like to track silence of 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.720
 dead listening concentration and cleaner 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.790
 is an asset specializes I 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.590
 hijackers looters as of the trigger 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.830
 after it seems to me that I still had 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.440
 sonar report undetectable and 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.900
 determination to banks like you 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 did you see one is and one was portrayed 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.030
 was not full we were 5 rebounds 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.750
 consider to consider this as crowd on 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.170
 was 5 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 we were on a rather simple map to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 play and good I still managed to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.800
 queuing likes everything I do you 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.020
 The offers I make them fast enough 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.980
 also for that I speak a little fast and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.790
 So here so I'll tell you what 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.470
 I think of this weapon 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.010
 some males are still very very 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.830
 well by far it hurts like ready 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
 also at the big rate of fire but I 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.120
 is the silent step up badly 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.280
 damage but 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.530
 saint silain su she is really very 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 very badly bullet a little hindsight and what 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.720
 is good too is that visor visor 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.910
 laser the red dot integrated it which 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.750
 allows us to have a better 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.240
 but solid wise precision so that's 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 a soul that can be counseled on 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.360
 small cards 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.500
 even though it's an assault rifle but it 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.710
 must still be avoided on 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.540
 big 4 like like whiteout houston 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.700
 confession does not really choke the handle of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.830
 especially since I had not put 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.150
 two handles there I put I'm going 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.040
 prefer to put laser measurements 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.140
 because the basic viewfinder it is when 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.330
 even quite complicated so I preferred 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.890
 have better accuracy than having 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.840
 a better shoot the same if it's by 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.140
 she herself here you understood me the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.080
 back on the trees do not bother too much 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.870
 so I preferred to do like that one 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.630
 ironing or and I'm already 17 0 end 18 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 0 with assistance so it does not advance 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.750
 hurt too you noticed in me I forget 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.600
 to tell you the kind of small 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.920
 auvernÃ© the ptite banner so I know 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.020
 you do not like it or you do not like it 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.490
 says the mans comments whose hands 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.030
 on my first video I put it 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.200
 so it's up to you to see if you 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.360
 prefer that I put it down I the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.750
 otherwise let me get up but I 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.830
 think it's nice enough it's gfx 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.480
 of the rage that made me so 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.940
 I like him I asked him to 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.140
 to do it gladly I quickly 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.160
 in addition he also made me my banner 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.860
 twitter and I also have mine 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.239
 have the link of his twitter in in the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.489
 banner and where you see a word it takes 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.270
 he go it's a sign so went on the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.530
 follow will not be sorry for the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
 little white I took my breath 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.580
 because I have not I had people 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.650

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.850

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.220

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.740
 in the comments I leave it 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.320

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.690
 kress not serious that's not it's not 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.850
 so important to leave that so 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.850

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.920
