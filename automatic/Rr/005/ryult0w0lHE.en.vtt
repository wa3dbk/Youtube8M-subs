00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.380
 my strength is a world that consists only of blocks and in which one is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.609
 first have to find their way around 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.509
 who did not manage to play this title Standard we help 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.640
 Get through the first steps with this video 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.170
 First and foremost, we need some wood that is usually available 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.039
 it is to find trees it should collect about 20 units that is 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.109
 no compulsory subject 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.109
 but a guideline 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.400
 For the pocket and full has a cave the best looking for the quiz 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.810
 our first hideaway for the night since that sharp down too stupid 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.540
 We will also stare at their wool 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 However, if no heavier one focus had to kill himself there 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 deal 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 back in the cave, we can probably in the Ruhr, the important 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 Alpine roads 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.950
 out of our wood we make ourselves first of a few wooden slats from which we 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 to build our workbench again 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.929
 Now, instead of our little one, we have 2 1 3 times 3 coach windows 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.669
 disposal 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.579
 we are going to build some handles for our tool we want to have today 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.309
 with our ax facts 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.639
 So we make from our homes Stiebel WG these again on top of each other 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.649
 and have the handle 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.949
 the tool he is beautiful is relatively simple and always follows the 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.119
 same pattern 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.489
 No matter what material you wanted to make your tool 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.069
 since we now have a wooden pickaxe we can in our small 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.079
 Cave stone and mine coal 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.250
 BoÃŸeln won stones we make the same ado 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.249
 Tool 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.779
 Ad up 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.349
 but for the first time we build in Weiser foresight, a few facts and that 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 became us at the conversation with light 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:29.840
 another important utensil is blast furnaces the fastest materials 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.979
 it always needed some coal 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.369
 You can not find things immediately which of your caves you can from two 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.340
 different types of wood 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.340
 Make charcoal 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.179
 With our Steinberg time we are now working on these trips 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.580
 What we want to do with it is clear 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.580
 even better tool 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.629
 previously quickly burned out of the tube so notes important railway and 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.779
 then off to Berg Bank and the time-tested formula for tools 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.779
 applied 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.400
 because we now have a whole row at a dance our inventory 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.790
 we should also stow them somewhere else 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.389
 better safe than sorry 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.610
 "We build a chest and pack our stuff in there 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.229
 whether he is still a sheep, evidently the mother or the father of the three 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.650
 other sheep 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.749
 Just try it now, we'll build our bed 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:32.219
 No, these are stages but Hey why not 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.080
 We'll take it with us sometimes 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.630
 so now but our bed and our hard-won wool from the children of the 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.710
 Bad man Marschaus up there is used 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.639
 three wooden slats and something wool on top and fully from a bed was 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.699
 create 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.809
 Now I show you the valuable use of our wooden steps 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.529
 not helpful 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.490
 what they do with these wood tones and why there was no rise door 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.039
 we'll tell you next time
