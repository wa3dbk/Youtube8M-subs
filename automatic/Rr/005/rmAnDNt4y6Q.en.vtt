00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.500 

so<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.130> most<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> projects<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.270> make

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
so for most of the projects that I make

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
so for most of the projects that I make
I<00:00:22.460> use<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> two<00:00:23.910> squares<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.949> use<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.099> one

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
I use one of two squares I use this one

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.929 
I use one of two squares I use this one
it's<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.760> speed<00:00:27.090> square<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:29.550> use<00:00:29.760> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it's a speed square and I use this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.569 
it's a speed square and I use this
little<00:00:30.570> guy<00:00:31.910> small<00:00:32.910> square<00:00:33.239> um<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> today<00:00:35.219> what

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
little guy small square um so today what

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
little guy small square um so today what
I'm<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.950> miniature

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
I'm going to do is make a miniature

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'm going to do is make a miniature
speed<00:00:38.700> square<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.420> it'll<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.809> similar<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
speed square so it'll be similar to this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
speed square so it'll be similar to this
one<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> I'll<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.660> able<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.020> fit<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.379> pocket

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
one and I'll be able to fit in my pocket

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.910 
one and I'll be able to fit in my pocket
and<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:45.059> start<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.420> I'll<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.530> using<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and to start out I'll just be using a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.299 
and to start out I'll just be using a
piece<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.309> maple<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.420> I'll<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.780> ahead<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.309> cut

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
piece of maple and I'll go ahead and cut

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:07.870 
piece of maple and I'll go ahead and cut
it<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> table<00:00:51.149> saw

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.300 

so<00:01:08.659> I'll<00:01:08.780> use<00:01:08.810> my<00:01:09.170> sled<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.770> make<00:01:09.920> sure<00:01:10.130> that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
so I'll use my sled to make sure that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.750 
so I'll use my sled to make sure that
everything<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.850> square<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.110> piece

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.360 

to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> triangle<00:01:19.260> I'll<00:01:19.800> just<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:20.340> my

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
to make the triangle I'll just use my

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.250 
to make the triangle I'll just use my
speed<00:01:21.060> square<00:01:22.490> lay<00:01:23.490> down<00:01:23.730> here<00:01:24.110> put<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
speed square lay down here put this

00:01:25.260 --> 00:03:47.020 
speed square lay down here put this
piece<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:26.630> hold<00:01:27.630> things<00:01:27.870> firmly<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:30.110> cut<00:01:31.110> it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.930 

so<00:04:00.050> my<00:04:00.200> miniature<00:04:00.530> speed<00:04:00.980> square<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.490> complete

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
so my miniature speed square is complete

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.559 
so my miniature speed square is complete
and<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.420> works<00:04:02.690> really<00:04:02.900> good

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
and it works really good

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.710 
and it works really good
you<00:04:05.569> can<00:04:05.720> go<00:04:05.870> together<00:04:06.080> with<00:04:06.440> my<00:04:06.650> other<00:04:07.720> small

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
you can go together with my other small

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.979 
you can go together with my other small
square<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.940> went<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.270> line<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.630> could<00:04:11.840> not

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
square so I went in line that could not

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.100 
square so I went in line that could not
find<00:04:12.230> one<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.790> really<00:04:13.940> do<00:04:14.420> like<00:04:14.630> this<00:04:14.840> one<00:04:15.080> I

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
find one and I really do like this one I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.150 
find one and I really do like this one I
use<00:04:15.319> it<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.560> lot<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:18.500> is<00:04:18.680> why<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.859> came<00:04:19.100> up

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
use it a lot so this is why I came up

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.780 
use it a lot so this is why I came up
with<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:19.519> idea<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.750> miniature<00:04:21.200> one<00:04:21.790> and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
with this idea of the miniature one and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.640 
with this idea of the miniature one and
it's<00:04:23.570> probably<00:04:23.780> one<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.230> easiest

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
it's probably one of the easiest

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.010 
it's probably one of the easiest
projects<00:04:25.220> I've<00:04:25.340> ever<00:04:25.370> made<00:04:25.790> but<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.540> really

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
projects I've ever made but I really

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.010 
projects I've ever made but I really
like<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:27.380> one<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.890> will<00:04:28.070> use<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.460> lot<00:04:29.020> so

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
like this one and I will use it a lot so

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.659 
like this one and I will use it a lot so
thanks<00:04:30.320> for<00:04:30.440> watching<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.100> we'll<00:04:31.430> see<00:04:31.550> you
