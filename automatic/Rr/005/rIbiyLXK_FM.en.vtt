00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.230
 hello only audience and 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.519
 viewers in this video I will 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.439
 show you which steps and with 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.750
 which programs your graphics card 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.240
 or graphics cards for the case that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.279
 there are several overclocking why 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.779
 Overclocks can make sense of what it is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.520
 pay attention and what the optimal 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.439
 Requirements are if we are still in 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.149
 explain another video in this video 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.910
 video therefore only the files overclocking 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.110
 even we need about two to three 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.570
 programs or alternatively 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.489
 challenging games the first program 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.890
 is used to manipulate clock rates and 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.300
 if necessary, the fan speed for it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.340
 Almost every major manufacturer has 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.390
 graphics cards your own tool though 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.910
 They all basically the same 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.320
 represent the most widely used and 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.630
 from the interface to probably the most accessible 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.650
 is the msi afterburner the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.329
 of course not at all 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.070
 measure your work done 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.899
 So after you apply it 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.399
 we can start the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.050
 clock rates of the video card in 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.329
 careful steps to increase 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.280
 should be more than 50 megahertz at a time 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.320
 you do not dare try blindly 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.969
 blindly we define this way 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.040
 you only know the current one 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.540
 taktraten does not rely on experience 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.430
 the other owner of yours back 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.049
 graphics card model kindly 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.710
 in a forum or similar to 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.659
 have made available 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.909
 if turn out during research 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.190
 should that many users card model on 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.900
 for example, 150 or more megahertz 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.420
 operate safely over the standard clock 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.909
 you can also take bigger steps 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.770
 In general, it is very advisable to own 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 Overclock try for yourself 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.640
 to inquire about the experiences of others 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.080
 by drag and drop or per 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.509
 We can double-click the one you want 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.979
 set taktrate that created now 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.170
 profile we can apply and 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.940
 save the graphics card after 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 overclocked a pc reboot again 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.039
 you put a hook at applied 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.570
 startup after the taktraten applied 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.220
 It is important to find out if the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.560
 card is stable and how strong the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.330
 temperature rises and the graphics card 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.740
 or to put as much weight as possible 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.780
 You can count on a variety of programs 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.030
 resort to this offer 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 for example the heaven benchmark 3d 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.289
 mark 11 or 3d mark vantage on 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.429
 the main thing is that the full potential 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.470
 the card is used 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.300
 long the temperatures remain stable 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.130
 and no artifacts could occur 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.930
 clock rates continue to push upwards 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.489
 around the temperature development 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.750
 fan speed and other values 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.690
 reliable to monitor 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.220
 is the application gpu z but 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 also overclocking schools like the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.299
 afterburner offer such functions 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.970
 but not always work 100 percent 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.680
 Reliable that would be something 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.480
 to the process of overclocking itself 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.799
 must know as mentioned above follows 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.870
 a video with information on the 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.970
 system requirements, benefits etc 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.019
 In that sense, it's good stop that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 ears stiff until then
