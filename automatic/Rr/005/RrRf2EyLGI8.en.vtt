00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.850
 ah 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.910
 this government has a very clear mission 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 ensure that the rights you enshrine 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.430
 our constitution 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.320
 really materialize in all 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.449
 Mexicans 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.849
 and this is what we will be doing in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 the next few years in the years of this 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.520
 administration devote greater efforts 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.520
 for those who need it most 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 and make our country more 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.879
 productive that has a chance to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 greater growth and more development 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.870
 social and that all this translates into 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 this effort and in this purpose that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 has the government to bring justice 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 social to all Mexicans 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.240
 to do so and to achieve our 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.450
 goals we will really achieve that 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.550
 and mexico meets the big five 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.800
 national goals that my government has 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.629
 drawn 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 that we can be a country of greater 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.360
 development and a more inclusive team of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.420
 less poverty and less inequality a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 Mexico where education reaches everyone 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.780
 and be of higher quality in Mexico in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 greater economic growth 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.009
 ok that's going to bring development 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.759
 individual and collective development between 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.090
 Mexicans in Mexico in conditions 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.159
 of peace and security in the face of efficiency 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.550
 that the security areas are 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.160
 showing before the citizens and about 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.950
 a whole team that assumes its 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.200
 joint and several liability 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.320
 great causes of humanity 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.930
 and with this conviction is that the government 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 of the republic has been deploying these 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.530
 efforts 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 I am convinced that if really 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.580
 we maintain this effort in a 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.820
 intense all the time if we do not lower the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.030
 guard and if we really meet the goal 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.700
 that we have drawn the face that 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.060
 mexico will have in the next six 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.930
 years will be one of greater development and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.930
 greater progress
