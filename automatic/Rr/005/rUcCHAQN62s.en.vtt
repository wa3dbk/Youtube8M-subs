it's a little bit smokier and I like you
know<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.510> diesel<00:03:44.550> fired<00:03:45.550> up<00:03:45.850> real<00:03:46.060> quick

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.270 

yeah<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.460> turbo<00:05:09.480> that<00:05:10.480> uh<00:05:11.130> doesn't<00:05:12.130> have<00:05:12.220> a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
yeah the turbo that uh doesn't have a

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.130 
yeah the turbo that uh doesn't have a
sounds<00:05:12.610> ring<00:05:12.820> on<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.150> so<00:05:13.300> it's<00:05:13.450> pretty<00:05:13.660> exposed

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
sounds ring on it so it's pretty exposed

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.960 
sounds ring on it so it's pretty exposed
up<00:05:14.320> pretty<00:05:14.500> it's<00:05:14.830> loud<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:16.120> spool<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.420> uh<00:05:17.970> goes

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
up pretty it's loud the spool is uh goes

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.610 
up pretty it's loud the spool is uh goes
about<00:05:19.090> 27<00:05:19.600> pounds<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.900> boost<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.410> uh<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:22.620> reckon

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
about 27 pounds of boost and uh I reckon

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.740 
about 27 pounds of boost and uh I reckon
that's<00:05:23.740> about<00:05:23.890> it

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
that's about it

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.390 
that's about it
