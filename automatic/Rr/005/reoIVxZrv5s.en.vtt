output something to keep in mind is of

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.600 
output something to keep in mind is of
the<00:01:11.450> SDI<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.900> not<00:01:12.320> going<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.680> be<00:01:12.830> through<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.160> BNC

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the SDI is not going to be through a BNC

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.280 
the SDI is not going to be through a BNC
connector<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.570> through<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.750> DIN<00:01:15.020> connector

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
connector it is through a DIN connector

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.530 
connector it is through a DIN connector
so<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.340> have<00:01:16.490> here<00:01:16.670> an<00:01:16.730> adapter<00:01:17.090> cable<00:01:17.390> I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
so we have here an adapter cable I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.560 
so we have here an adapter cable I
converted<00:01:18.290> into<00:01:18.500> female<00:01:19.250> BNC<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.270> go<00:01:20.390> ahead

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
converted into female BNC and go ahead

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.420 
converted into female BNC and go ahead
and<00:01:20.690> use<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.200> feed<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:21.830> other<00:01:22.010> monitors
