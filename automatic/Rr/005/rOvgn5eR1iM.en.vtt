00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.390
 Hello everyone in this video tutorial 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.629
 let's see how to insert a signature with the 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.820
 html logo inside the 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.720
 version 6 of mail the version they have 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.010
 released with the new system 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.650
 operating apple but lion antennas 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:30.130
 first we need to create a new one 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:32.860
 email signature so let's go into preferences 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.190
 add a signature see here number 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.190
 12 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.040
 here already began to experience something that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 it can be temporary and then change it 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.150
 or if you already have an idea 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.629
 of what to write as in this case me 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.890
 I've already prepared my links for a package 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.619
 and here we say ready a base of the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 our new signature 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.690
 we close preferences and leave by email 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.549
 here is this point we have to send the 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:10.930
 our logo so we have it already 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.930
 prepared by starting on the web 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.440
 then in a clouding service like 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.700
 it can be icloud black box 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.510
 you will know an effects that are personal 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.490
 In this case we use I use cloudapp 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.830
 that there were already installed then for 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.190
 comfort use that i love was already 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.130
 prepared monster in png then with 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.000
 this transparency you see is wide 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.180
 200 pixels that had to be one 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.950
 more dimension more than just we take 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 the logo and load it in our country 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.870
 to ping a bag is what the sheep 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 upload sold teasing wherever 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:57.000
 perfect success we open cloudapp 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.300
 and here is emeralda 5 that we have 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.730
 just loaded by clicking on it there 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.030
 we find in this screen in the center 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 at the top right you see direct link 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.780
 by clicking on it we have the address vrl 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.110
 of our blog 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.930
 we understand it now we have to go to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.150
 write in this html code for 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.390
 be able to insert it in the signature of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390
 email 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 open a text editor anyway 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.780
 we can use textedit vin e 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.430
 whatever else this is the string that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.410
 also found in the description of the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.850
 video so you can copy 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.880
 in the first line we have to put 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.410
 the website address of the team in short 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.050
 where we have implemented in this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.120
 case get loud up and between the two commas 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.790
 in the line below we need to paste 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.180
 the vrl address of our logo we save 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.180
 with the name 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.310
 html is an important extension 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.650
 html we save the desktop ed 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.680
 here we have our code ready 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.180
 to be inserted in the signature it becomes 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.170
 at this point 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.819
 we open the finder in the top menu 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.400
 we must go to find locate 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.349
 library then click on go and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.819
 we press the alt key 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.819
 see that the library appears 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.580
 let's go to voodoo mail and mail date yes 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.799
 mythos 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.690
 here we change our view so that 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.739
 we can identify thanks to the time 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.970
 the last signature we entered that 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:19.269
 this to the 18 03 signatures practically 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 but a code with the open 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:28.340
 the text editor 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.660
 here is what you see is practically the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.350
 html code of the signature we have 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.390
 inserted before e mail 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.280
 we always open later with 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:45.300
 the text editor also our signature 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.480
 we copy everything and paste it underneath 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.740
 where you see gem inversion we leave one 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:05:02.370
 space and we paste our logo in 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:04.470
 html we record on the save now the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.330
 Our signature is ready one thing 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.060
 absolutely important 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.350
 fundamental 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:16.230
 as the mail system would return from 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.450
 default to the signature we have 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.930
 made in preferences we have to go 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.380
 to lock this file then key 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.270
 right 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:34.260
 get information and check 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:35.280
 locked you see done this the job is 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.090
 over 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.780
 now let's open mail and go to 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:49.170
 check if our new logo is 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.090
 ready we open preferences we share 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.330
 the last signature we heard the 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.680
 12 here you see that there is the little square with the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.250
 question marks means that the logo is 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:04.640
 been loaded to make sure we try 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:08.240
 to go and compose a new message 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.240
 new message 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.989
 signature 12 

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:22.359
 and here is our new signature with the 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:25.109
 html logo hello to everyone to the next 

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:25.109
