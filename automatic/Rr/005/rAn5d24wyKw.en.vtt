00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the experience and and perhaps the most

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.760 
the experience and and perhaps the most
painful<00:01:09.670> injury<00:01:09.970> an<00:01:10.540> athlete<00:01:10.900> can<00:01:11.080> endure<00:01:11.350> um

it's<00:01:12.190> one<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.610> most<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.119> think<00:01:13.150> it's<00:01:14.080> not<00:01:14.259> a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
it's one of the most I think it's not a

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.410 
it's one of the most I think it's not a
good<00:01:14.470> one<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.770> have<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.340> what<00:01:15.850> were<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.060> you

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
good one to have and what were you you

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.270 
good one to have and what were you you
don't<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.410> took<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.740> step<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.220> it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
don't you just you took a step and it

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.100 
don't you just you took a step and it
happened<00:01:18.640> anybody<00:01:18.940> but<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.180> think<00:01:19.479> in<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.900> last

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
happened anybody but I think in the last

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.540 
happened anybody but I think in the last
two<00:01:20.380> years<00:01:20.619> I've<00:01:20.920> been<00:01:20.950> pushing<00:01:21.430> myself
