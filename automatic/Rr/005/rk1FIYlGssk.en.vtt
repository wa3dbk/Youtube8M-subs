we've increased capacity on many
combines<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.030> being

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
combines out there that are being

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
combines out there that are being
offered<00:00:39.390> we've<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.160> industry

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
offered we've also as an industry

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.720 
offered we've also as an industry
increased<00:00:42.270> complexity<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> 9005

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
increased complexity with the 9005

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
increased complexity with the 9005
series<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> combine<00:00:45.750> we've<00:00:46.530> taken<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
series of combine we've taken that and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889 
series of combine we've taken that and
thrown<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> side<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.629> made<00:00:48.870> sure

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thrown that to the side and made sure

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.220 
thrown that to the side and made sure
that<00:00:49.620> our<00:00:49.680> combines<00:00:50.520> without<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> question<00:00:51.960> are

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that our combines without a question are

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
that our combines without a question are
the<00:00:52.379> simplest<00:00:52.770> combines<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.969> industry

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the simplest combines in the industry

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360

very proud of is that we roughly run
about<00:01:52.770> 50<00:01:53.220> percent<00:01:53.399> less<00:01:53.820> belts<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
about 50 percent less belts than some of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
about 50 percent less belts than some of
our<00:01:55.020> other<00:01:55.110> manufacturers<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:57.180> this

our other manufacturers and on this
machine<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.079> we're<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.710> proud<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
machine right here we're very proud of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.819 
machine right here we're very proud of
the<00:01:59.310> fact<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.329> only<00:02:00.630> utilize<00:02:01.079> three

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the fact that we only utilize three

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.420 
the fact that we only utilize three
major<00:02:02.100> chains<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.530> machine<00:02:04.860> as

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
major chains on here on the machine as

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.570 
major chains on here on the machine as
well<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:06.600> simplicity<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.160> important

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
well a simplicity is very very important

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
well a simplicity is very very important
on<00:02:08.610> combines<00:02:09.119> because<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> means<00:02:10.110> fewer

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
on combines because if it means fewer

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
combine mean fewer things to go wrong

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900 
combine mean fewer things to go wrong
and<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.830> customer<00:02:20.220> doesn't<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.700> worry

side<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> machine<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:36.150> which<00:02:36.690> basically

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
side of the machine here which basically

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.280 
side of the machine here which basically
controls<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.360> upper<00:02:39.360> chaffeur<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.020> sieve

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.470 
controls the upper chaffeur and sieve
and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.340> obviously<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:42.000> lights<00:02:42.270> on

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
and then we obviously have lights on

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.350 
and then we obviously have lights on
here<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.990> control<00:02:43.880> service<00:02:44.880> lights<00:02:45.120> for<00:02:45.300> the
