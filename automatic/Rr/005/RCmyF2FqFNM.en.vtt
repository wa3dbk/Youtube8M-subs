00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.930
 as a sign of the progress made in 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.160
 Spain 'in the automotive industry 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.080
 We offer here this small report 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.910
 obtained in a factory installed in the 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.980
 free zone of vigo and its chain 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.120
 assembly mechanics that can produce 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.120
 up to six cars per hour 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.540
 currently working on two ships of 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.100
 260 meters long by 60 wide and it 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.710
 has begun the construction of a 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.650
 the third same characteristics 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.310
 production began in 1958 and in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.230
 a pilot workshop on January first 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.360
 1961 had already produced 6,000 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.330
 vehicles and for the current year the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.400
 production will be 8 thousand units its 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.230
 excellent suspension makes them be the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.930
 more fit for the countryside and bad roads 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.190
 its consumption is 4 liters and a half to 5 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.190
 for every 100 kilometers 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.879
 here is an especially apt model 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.829
 for all terrain its novelty consists in 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.990
 which is provided with two motors and can 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.470
 roll indistinctly with both or with 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.470
 one of them 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.899
 the car can be occupied by four 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 people and roll on sand earrings 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.220
 in principle it coincided with destiny to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 Sahara and is especially indicated 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.549
 for the construction works of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.649
 marshes and large farms 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.270
 agricultural and forestry tests 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.159
 made with the two vehicle 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.649
 engines give the result he has fancied 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.299
 marches perfectly on all kinds of 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.490
 land and face and save the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.399
 smooth obstacles its launch 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 marks the growing pace of the industry 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.060
 automotive utility
