00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 Go 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.140
 hi guys today we want with the drone 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 hard road 2.0 of the park eric edition 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 as you see in the camouflage version from 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.079
 hull but we immediately go to open the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 pack that looks like it 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.610
 in this way 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 here it is we have the signal that we are there 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 will come to do the races with 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 the application the dedicated race 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.589
 but here is our drone inside 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 of the package we find it with the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.309
 hull think of it to fly 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 inside then as you see one 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 hull with protections as you see in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.539
 In this case, make your mail regular 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 at home so that the drone does not go 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.129
 Mars to ruin your home itself 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 do not go to ruin the hull open 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.719
 in this way we see the best 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.789
 the inside of our drone is there 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.390
 space dedicated to housing the 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.570
 battery 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.790
 the pre 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 I insert the battery for a moment 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.610
 easily this way by going to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.700
 attack the risk sri stick it 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.310
 attacking the two extremes in this way 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.140
 so as you see it's ok and then here is 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.729
 also the possibility to insert a 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.200
 usb stick to record 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.729
 automatically all the videos that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.460
 they are shot by the camera 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 front this one up front or from the front 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.979
 rear view camera that frames the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 low then what the drone sees 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 from which we have all the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 sensor that serves aldone for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.750
 sensitize to stabilize the sound 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.509
 in the case we place outside 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.710
 we can also use the hull more 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.960
 slim this one we find 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.729
 inside the packaging that like 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.920
 you see it fits easily there is a 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.080
 magnetic attack and I do n't know woman 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.300
 is ready to fly outside in the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.670
 packaging are also stickers for 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.070
 make the drone more visible during the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.110
 flight and the charger I don't have here with 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.720
 me precisely just loaded indro nor their 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.080
 nor do you charge for talking about the battery 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.600
 approximately in 1 hour and a half of charge and the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.040
 flying time is approximately ten 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.410
 minutes then also depends on the intensity 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120
 that you flip then jump of death 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 that you make etc. 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.790
 but let's see immediately how the flies 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.980
 heron 2.0 drone part we turn on 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.350
 our application after that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.239
 we verify that there is wifi signal between 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.150
 the drone is the application at this point 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.250
 we can also set some preferences 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.870
 as the altitude limit as in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.910
 high to be able to give the drone limit of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.579
 horizontal vertical speed the angle 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.350
 of inclination if we have inserted the 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.690
 hull for the flight in this case no 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.820
 because we are outside therefore 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.310
 we select flight outside in this 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.489
 way destinations also change the data to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.000
 available and select the mode 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.620
 control of the drone itself finally to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.880
 what are the status data but 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.880
 let's start with the flight 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.359
 now let's try the application arrs like 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.670
 see I have positioned the signal here 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.799
 below the drone as the same says 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.230
 application we can the ar.drone above 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.590
 the goal and we fly here is beginning of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.170
 game 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.969
 as you can see the traffic lights come on e 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.609
 away at this point we have to do the 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.019
 our race towards the path that 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.759
 we have delimited we put that in mine 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.759
 in case it is the turn of these trees 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.330
 I change the camera I check that 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.670
 the decay by changing the camera both 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.960
 above my signal as you see it 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.880
 can see life 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.380
 here is the race over at this point I can 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.630
 land and as you see we see or the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.160
 possibility of landing on the ground 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.160
 here is the race over
