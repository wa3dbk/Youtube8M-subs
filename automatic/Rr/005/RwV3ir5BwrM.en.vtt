00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
paying attention to my body and I think

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.840 
paying attention to my body and I think
that<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.140> would<00:05:40.290> be<00:05:40.440> obvious<00:05:40.700> with<00:05:41.700> the

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
that that would be obvious with the

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.200 
that that would be obvious with the
changes<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.390> I'm<00:05:42.750> wanting<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.260> see<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:44.250> this

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
changes that I'm wanting to see so this

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.870 
changes that I'm wanting to see so this
is<00:05:45.450> why<00:05:45.660> I'm<00:05:45.990> barely<00:05:46.590> dressed<00:05:47.010> so<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.700> I<00:05:47.730> can

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
is why I'm barely dressed so that I can

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.720 
is why I'm barely dressed so that I can
see<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> transformation<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:49.350> I'm<00:05:50.250> making

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730
