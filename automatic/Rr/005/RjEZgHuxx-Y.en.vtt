00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
think it's surely what they made people

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.900 
think it's surely what they made people
think<00:02:29.080> about<00:02:29.290> pokemon<00:02:29.800> grey<00:02:30.010> which<00:02:30.370> never

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
think about pokemon grey which never

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.440 
think about pokemon grey which never
happened<00:02:31.450> besides<00:02:32.230> kilos<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.310> my<00:02:33.550> opinion<00:02:33.940> had

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
happened besides kilos in my opinion had

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.660 
happened besides kilos in my opinion had
a<00:02:34.480> very<00:02:34.780> lame<00:02:34.990> story<00:02:35.260> line<00:02:35.530> dole<00:02:36.100> characters

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
a very lame story line dole characters

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.670 
a very lame story line dole characters
and<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.330> non<00:02:37.570> memorable<00:02:38.200> region

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
and it was just a non memorable region

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
and it was just a non memorable region
it<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.220> be<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> bad<00:02:39.670> idea<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.150> make<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> single

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it would be a bad idea to make a single

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.560 
it would be a bad idea to make a single
polished<00:02:41.470> sequel<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.550> emerald<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.120> crystal

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
polished sequel like emerald a crystal

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.080 
polished sequel like emerald a crystal
so<00:02:44.320> if<00:02:44.710> i'm<00:02:45.040> right<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.520> they're<00:02:45.910> not

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
so if i'm right and they're not

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.060 
so if i'm right and they're not
releasing<00:02:46.420> pokemon<00:02:47.050> z<00:02:47.290> will<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.920> mean

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
releasing pokemon z will that mean

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.180 
releasing pokemon z will that mean
they'll<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.490> releasing<00:02:49.030> x2<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> y2<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.920> short

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
they'll be releasing x2 and y2 the short

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.510 
they'll be releasing x2 and y2 the short
answer<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.690> maybe<00:02:52.690> they<00:02:53.680> had<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:53.860> done<00:02:54.370> this

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
answer is maybe they had just done this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.580 
answer is maybe they had just done this
