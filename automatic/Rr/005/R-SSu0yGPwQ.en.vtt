same time we're talking about storm

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.790 
same time we're talking about storm
doors<00:00:36.790> if<00:00:37.329> your<00:00:37.600> front<00:00:37.840> door<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.170> older<00:00:38.590> but

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
doors if your front door is older but

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.500 
doors if your front door is older but
still<00:00:39.160> in<00:00:39.309> good<00:00:39.340> condition<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:40.030> storm<00:00:40.329> door

still in good condition a storm door

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.150 
still in good condition a storm door
might<00:00:40.930> be<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.140> good<00:00:41.379> choice<00:00:41.590> for<00:00:41.649> you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
might be a good choice for you

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.579 
might be a good choice for you
a<00:00:42.190> newer<00:00:42.910> door<00:00:43.210> with<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.510> tight-fitting<00:00:43.960> seal

a newer door with a tight-fitting seal

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.189 
a newer door with a tight-fitting seal
won't<00:00:45.160> benefit<00:00:45.730> as<00:00:45.850> much<00:00:45.879> in<00:00:46.360> energy<00:00:46.780> savings

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
won't benefit as much in energy savings

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.990 
won't benefit as much in energy savings
now<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.739> storm<00:00:48.160> door<00:00:48.309> can<00:00:48.550> help<00:00:48.699> you<00:00:48.790> save

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
now a storm door can help you save

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.450 
now a storm door can help you save
energy<00:00:49.180> in<00:00:49.510> two<00:00:49.809> ways<00:00:50.050> first<00:00:50.829> it<00:00:51.040> creates<00:00:51.160> a

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
energy in two ways first it creates a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.220 
energy in two ways first it creates a
barrier<00:00:51.670> from<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.059> outside<00:00:52.480> whether<00:00:52.750> cutting

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
barrier from the outside whether cutting

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.200 
barrier from the outside whether cutting
down<00:00:53.409> on<00:00:53.589> air<00:00:53.829> leaks<00:00:54.070> from<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.400> main<00:00:54.640> door<00:00:54.909> and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
down on air leaks from the main door and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.840 
down on air leaks from the main door and
also<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:55.930> storm<00:00:56.320> door<00:00:56.530> creates<00:00:57.010> an<00:00:57.220> insulating

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
also a storm door creates an insulating

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.460 
also a storm door creates an insulating
air<00:00:57.970> pocket<00:00:58.540> between<00:00:58.690> those<00:00:59.019> two<00:00:59.229> doors

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
air pocket between those two doors

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.079 
air pocket between those two doors

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.210 
measure the opening
this<00:02:40.450> might<00:02:40.720> seem<00:02:41.020> basic<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.770> experts

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
this might seem basic but the experts

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.550 
this might seem basic but the experts
will<00:02:42.400> tell<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.819> people<00:02:43.450> often<00:02:44.290> order

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
will tell you that people often order

yet the threshold is tapered toward the
outside<00:02:51.760> you'll<00:02:52.330> need<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.630> cut<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.020> hinge

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
outside you'll need to cut the hinge

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.080 
outside you'll need to cut the hinge
bracket<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:54.069> match<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.520> angle<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> the

to make that cut most storm doors are

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.860 
to make that cut most storm doors are
now<00:03:00.340> universal<00:03:01.030> what<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.360> means<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.840> that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
now universal what that means is that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.570 
now universal what that means is that
you<00:03:02.080> can<00:03:02.230> install<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.739> hinge<00:03:02.980> bracket<00:03:03.430> on
