about who the best character is this is

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
about who the best character is this is
just<00:00:22.470> me<00:00:23.010> talking<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.910> characters

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
just me talking about the characters

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.980 
just me talking about the characters
that<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:25.170> number<00:00:25.949> 10<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.519> Itachi<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that I like number 10 is Itachi and this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.599 
that I like number 10 is Itachi and this
one<00:00:28.199> mostly<00:00:28.500> stems<00:00:28.859> from<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> fact<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
one mostly stems from the fact that I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.759 
one mostly stems from the fact that I
just<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.960> want<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.470> more

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
just really really want to know more

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.250 
just really really want to know more
about<00:00:31.830> him<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.660> characters<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
about him a lot of these characters I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.459 
about him a lot of these characters I
like<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:36.329> they<00:00:36.660> were<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.899> appear<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
like because if they were to appear on

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
like because if they were to appear on
screen<00:00:37.710> I'd<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.370> yes<00:00:38.700> show<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
screen I'd be like yes show me more I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.950 
screen I'd be like yes show me more I
think<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.290> really<00:00:40.670> important<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.059> if

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
think that's really important because if

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
think that's really important because if
you're<00:00:43.200> oversaturated<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> character<00:00:44.670> or

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you're oversaturated by a character or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
you're oversaturated by a character or
if<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.780> too<00:00:45.840> much<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> character

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
if you know too much about a character

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
if you know too much about a character
then<00:00:46.860> there's<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.520> mystery<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> what

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
then there's not as much mystery in what

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
then there's not as much mystery in what
they're<00:00:48.960> doing<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.410> yearning<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.430> more

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
they're doing that yearning to see more

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
they're doing that yearning to see more
is<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.660> very<00:00:51.960> important<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.860> definitely

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
is it's very important and I definitely

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.529 
is it's very important and I definitely
definitely<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.510> about

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
definitely want to know more about

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.709 
definitely want to know more about

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
Itachi number nine is one that has much

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.670 
Itachi number nine is one that has much
less<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.840> reasonable<00:01:00.840> explanation<00:01:01.170> it's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
less of a reasonable explanation it's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.880 
less of a reasonable explanation it's
can<00:01:01.980> Kuro<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.180> started<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.559> really

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
can Kuro this one started really really

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.850 
can Kuro this one started really really
late<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> show<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.540> me<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
different about him through most of it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.130 
different about him through most of it
but<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.320> fell<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.159> love<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.270> end<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
around Jiraiya is a really really great

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.950 
around Jiraiya is a really really great

arc I started to like him a lot better I

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.309 
arc I started to like him a lot better I
like<00:02:24.120> even<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.750> he<00:02:24.810> takes<00:02:25.019> his<00:02:25.080> hood

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319

off

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.440 
off
he<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.459> looks<00:02:26.640> more<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.000> human<00:02:27.299> when<00:02:27.420> he

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
he just looks more like a human when he

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.170 
he just looks more like a human when he
does<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:28.110> number<00:02:28.470> six<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.920> energy<00:02:29.579> again<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
does that number six is energy again I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.819 
does that number six is energy again I
think<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:30.840> kids<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.170> were<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
think a lot of the kids that were in the

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.009 
think a lot of the kids that were in the
Sasuke<00:02:32.280> recovery<00:02:32.790> arc<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.269> pretty<00:02:33.569> lucky

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
Sasuke recovery arc are pretty lucky

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.110 
Sasuke recovery arc are pretty lucky
that<00:02:34.709> they<00:02:34.950> got<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.310> treatment<00:02:35.700> because

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that they got that treatment because

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
that they got that treatment because
they<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.079> got<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.319> show<00:02:37.500> off<00:02:37.650> more<00:02:37.890> of

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
they kind of got to show off more of

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.890 
they kind of got to show off more of
themselves<00:02:38.280> than<00:02:38.670> some<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> characters

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
themselves than some of the characters

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.430 
themselves than some of the characters
who<00:02:40.049> weren't<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.159> adventure<00:02:42.109> so<00:02:43.109> I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
who weren't on that adventure so I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.710 
who weren't on that adventure so I
started<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.310> Neji<00:02:44.700> through<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> arc<00:02:45.359> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
started to like Neji through that arc I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
started to like Neji through that arc I
definitely<00:02:46.379> thought<00:02:46.620> his<00:02:46.829> character<00:02:47.220> was

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
definitely thought his character was

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.330 
definitely thought his character was
very<00:02:47.579> interesting<00:02:48.180> prior<00:02:48.599> he<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.470> he<00:02:50.190> was

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
very interesting prior he was he was

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
very interesting prior he was he was
rated<00:02:50.670> pretty<00:02:50.879> high<00:02:51.120> earlier<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.109> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
rated pretty high earlier on in the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.319 
rated pretty high earlier on in the
series<00:02:52.440> too<00:02:52.769> because<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.489> found<00:02:54.000> him<00:02:54.299> very

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
series too because I found him very

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.360 
series too because I found him very
interesting<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.319> compelling<00:02:55.859> along

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
interesting and very compelling along

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
interesting and very compelling along
with<00:02:56.519> his<00:02:56.700> story<00:02:57.090> being<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.750> interesting

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
with his story being very interesting

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.809 
with his story being very interesting
and<00:02:58.379> very<00:02:58.409> compelling<00:02:58.859> I<00:02:59.220> think<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.670> there

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
and very compelling I think that there

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.300 
and very compelling I think that there
is<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> lot<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.420> places<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.170> his<00:03:01.859> character

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
is a lot of places that his character

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.449 
is a lot of places that his character
could<00:03:02.640> go<00:03:02.879> in<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.450> far<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.620> hasn't<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.250> been

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
could go in so far it hasn't really been

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.970 
could go in so far it hasn't really been
capitalized<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.420> properly<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.290> I'd<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
capitalized on properly and I'd like to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.680 
capitalized on properly and I'd like to
see<00:03:08.220> him<00:03:08.459> kind<00:03:08.609> of<00:03:08.700> fleshed<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.180> more

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
see him kind of fleshed out more

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.690 
see him kind of fleshed out more
