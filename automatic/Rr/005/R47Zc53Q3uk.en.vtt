tennis training here to talk about the
overhead<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.010> smash<00:00:08.309> okay<00:00:09.030> probably<00:00:09.420> one

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
overhead or the smash okay probably one

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.140 
overhead or the smash okay probably one
of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> most<00:00:10.349> messed<00:00:11.130> up<00:00:11.370> shots<00:00:11.730> I'm<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.090> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
of the most messed up shots I'm going to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.780 
of the most messed up shots I'm going to
say<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.809> tennis<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> most<00:00:14.460> fearful

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
say in tennis one of the most fearful

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.480 
say in tennis one of the most fearful
shots<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.450> well<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.830> reason<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.279> come

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
shots as well so the reason you come

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
shots as well so the reason you come
into<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.880> net<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.150> tennis<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
into the net in tennis is to put the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
into the net in tennis is to put the
ball<00:00:19.320> away<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.430> reason<00:00:20.760> you

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
ball away and I think the reason you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.029 
ball away and I think the reason you
volley<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.539> hit<00:00:21.750> approach<00:00:22.109> shots<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
volley and hit approach shots is so the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550 
volley and hit approach shots is so the
opponent<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.699> lob<00:00:24.060> okay<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> you've<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
opponent can lob okay and you've got a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
opponent can lob okay and you've got a
nice<00:00:25.800> put<00:00:26.250> away<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:27.029> smudge<00:00:27.390> stronger<00:00:27.990> up

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
nice put away your smudge stronger up

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
nice put away your smudge stronger up
here<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:30.090> wrist

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here and you can really use your wrist

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to snap the ball down and most

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
to snap the ball down and most
importantly<00:00:32.369> angle<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> ball<00:00:33.210> off<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> court

step<00:00:42.629> i've<00:00:43.110> volleyed<00:00:43.649> i've<00:00:43.829> moved<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
step i've volleyed i've moved into the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
step i've volleyed i've moved into the
net<00:00:45.090> okay<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> ball<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:46.980> I've

net okay I see the ball up in there I've
got<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> anticipate<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.300> shot<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
got to anticipate that shot so the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200 
got to anticipate that shot so the
racket<00:00:49.289> face<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.500> open<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.370> opponents<00:00:50.879> showing

up and as I've done that I've just
turned<00:01:08.580> sideways<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.630> simply<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
turned sideways so really simply I'm a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.940 
turned sideways so really simply I'm a
righty<00:01:10.560> boom<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.460> position<00:01:11.810> okay<00:01:12.950> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
righty boom I'm in position okay you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
righty boom I'm in position okay you
don't<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> overhead<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
don't have much time on the overhead to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
don't have much time on the overhead to
wind<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> swing<00:01:16.470> you've<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
wind up and swing you've got to get that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.950 
wind up and swing you've got to get that
racquet<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:18.840> going

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
racquet up because it's probably going

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
racquet up because it's probably going
to<00:01:19.020> come<00:01:19.229> quick<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> you've<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> move

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to come quick and you've got to move

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.640 
to come quick and you've got to move
quickly<00:01:20.939> backwards<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:22.170> getting

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
quickly backwards so I'm getting

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.030 
quickly backwards so I'm getting
sideways<00:01:23.250> racquets<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.799> I'm

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
sideways racquets up then from here I'm

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
sideways racquets up then from here I'm
ready<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.909> angle<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> ball<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> court

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

okay<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.070> well<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.780> position<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.409> can

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
okay as well as in this position I can

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.240 
okay as well as in this position I can
move<00:01:31.890> much<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.520> efficiently<00:01:33.680> most<00:01:34.680> people<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
move much more efficiently most people I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.730 
move much more efficiently most people I
see<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.820> mistake<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.420> make<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:37.439> don't

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
see the mistake they make is they don't

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
see the mistake they make is they don't
they<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.100> either<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.670> big<00:01:38.970> swing<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> they

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they take either a big swing and they

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.800 
they take either a big swing and they
face<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.170> net<00:01:40.350> okay<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:42.180> tough<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
face the net okay really really tough to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
face the net okay really really tough to
