00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 it's not out to Lopez garai so there's 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.380
 corner the ball down the line in the background 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.640
 for the real society of san sebastián 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.610
 and the inside of the area too long 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.340
 for imanol agirretxe gonzalo castro 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.740
 white right good ball header 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.570
 alto of griezmann that is the second time 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.990
 that wins over the defender of the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.990
 Cordova 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.570
 first it drives well 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.390
 look here now uncomfortable as the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.969
 auction gesture spikes the ball and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.350
 head of the defense also from there 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.359
 break the eyebrow 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.949
 I do not think it's very clear who in 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.589
 the blood because for you it is not likely 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.190
 222 may be bleeding 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.190
 probable 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.490
 you probably have both because the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.920
 headshot 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.860
 Griezmann is clear 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.909
 Well, well, you can continue to skate 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.310
 the field for you what you are saying 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.979
 dynamic and if it comes out the griezmann the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.720
 little night that we take of right said 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.549
 all this bitter I think that griezmann 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.450
 finish as you have to adapt yes yes yes 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.890
 perfect auction if more miserable but 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.440
 it goes like and is about maldonado 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.630
 specialist and it's a brave auction is 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.759
 a brave finish because there in this 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.490
 You have the head of the opponent 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.820
 so close that the logical thing is that what happens 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 what has happened is that it gives you a boost 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 which are head movements 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.580
 Well with that new 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.640
 It is very beautiful below 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.100
 with the bad luck that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.979
 there are two gaps that are being applied 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.510
 a very cumbersome but good so that 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.560
 endure until the end of this first 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.210
 part 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 in case of patiño it will be similar 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 of our Córdoba channel already has the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.450
 injured by a new real but fernandez 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.890
 now a patiño always with the bad 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.150
 luck for the cordoba that just when 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.770
 he has stayed with one less time 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.280
 since he has stayed with one less the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.690
 color has reached the goal 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.830
 unfortunate in everything as we said in the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.830
 moment that occurred 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.120
 recover in the central circle lópez 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.370
 silva but loses the córdoba very fast 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.600
 absolute that they are going to attack agirretxe 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.320
 it crosses dragons defenses Chori Castro 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.210
 with a lot of luck 6a holding up well 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.730
 you've seen perfect adolfo the movement 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.550
 of grip of agirretxe to open a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.160
 hallway and we see it still for 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.500
 drag to gaspar and open a hallway 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.440
 greater than autori castro who tries 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.890
 cross but Saizar holds up very well and the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.030
 take out there 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.030
 with the ankle 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.970
 you can go back patiño 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.130
 the referee has to eat 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.200
 have to see if he is bleeding or not with 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.480
 our sacred for example 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 except Castro closing many a ball to 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 Griezmann again above 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.630
 well then 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.000
 I did not qualify as Griezmann 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.680
 a good dominator of the aerial game but 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.520
 today he is doing a lot 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.520
 damage to Córdoba 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.660
 they make three head shots 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.890
 the vision that he placed to griezmann
