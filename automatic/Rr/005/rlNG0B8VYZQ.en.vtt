00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
watching these weak spots you guys need

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750 
watching these weak spots you guys need
to<00:00:36.120> take<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.570> factors<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.170> account<00:00:37.760> like

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to take other factors into account like

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
to take other factors into account like
the<00:00:38.940> size<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.390> gun<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the size of your gun so if you have a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
the size of your gun so if you have a
small<00:00:40.950> gun<00:00:41.300> penetration<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> still<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
small gun penetration is still going to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
small gun penetration is still going to
be<00:00:42.899> hard<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.620> weak<00:00:43.829> spots<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> may

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
be hard on these weak spots you may

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
be hard on these weak spots you may
still<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.969> penetrate<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
still not penetrate or do a lot of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.139 
still not penetrate or do a lot of
damage<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.399> where<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.670> easier<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
damage this is just where it's easier to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
damage this is just where it's easier to
hit<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> tier<00:00:50.219> 9<00:00:50.250> gun<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.149> now

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
hit I have a tier 9 gun on right now

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939 
hit I have a tier 9 gun on right now
that's<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:51.930> able<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> penetrate<00:00:52.530> all

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that's why I'm able to penetrate all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
that's why I'm able to penetrate all
these<00:00:53.129> things<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> tier<00:00:54.300> 5

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
these things but if I like a tier 5

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880 
these things but if I like a tier 5
going<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> probably<00:00:55.260> wouldn't<00:00:55.800> be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going on it probably wouldn't be

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.240 
going on it probably wouldn't be
possible<00:00:59.000> another<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> guys<00:01:01.250> these

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
possible another thing is you guys these

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
possible another thing is you guys these
skins<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.120> illegal<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.049> them

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
skins are not illegal you can use them

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
skins are not illegal you can use them
in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> game<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.339> they're<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:05.970> good

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in the game but they're not really good

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
in the game but they're not really good
for<00:01:06.540> in-game<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.409> only<00:01:07.830> visible<00:01:07.950> through

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
for in-game they're only visible through

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
for in-game they're only visible through
scope<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.360> through<00:01:09.600> bushes<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
scope and not through bushes and up

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
scope and not through bushes and up
close<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.790> they're<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.510> tool<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
close so they're more of a tool for

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070 
close so they're more of a tool for
learning<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> hit<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> tanks<00:01:15.119> instead<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
learning how to hit the tanks instead of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.950 
learning how to hit the tanks instead of
having<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.770> research<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.509> guys<00:01:18.750> can

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
having to do research so you guys can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690

don't<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> game<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.950> use<00:01:23.100> them

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
don't use them in game I just use them

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.050 
don't use them in game I just use them
to<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> guys<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:25.520> think<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> next

to show you guys these I think the next

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
to show you guys these I think the next
video<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.450> trying<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> try<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
video I'm trying to try and get up is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.810 
video I'm trying to try and get up is
the<00:01:29.009> t-34<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> e<00:01:30.780> 50<00:01:31.350> after<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the t-34 and then the e 50 after that I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.660 
the t-34 and then the e 50 after that I
try<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.840> post<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> video<00:01:34.770> every<00:01:35.159> 4<00:01:35.400> days

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
try to post about a video every 4 days

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
try to post about a video every 4 days
so<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> t-34<00:01:37.020> should<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.799> 4<00:01:38.159> days

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so the t-34 should be up in about 4 days

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
so the t-34 should be up in about 4 days
guys<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.030> maybe<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.630> commentary<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.619> coming

just to let you guys know I showed the
right<00:02:24.140> hand<00:02:24.380> side<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> tank<00:02:25.130> first<00:02:25.670> before

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
right hand side of the tank first before

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.490 
right hand side of the tank first before
the<00:02:26.300> left<00:02:26.510> hand<00:02:26.750> if<00:02:26.930> you're<00:02:27.050> looking<00:02:27.080> at<00:02:27.410> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the left hand if you're looking at the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.550 
the left hand if you're looking at the
tank<00:02:27.740> in<00:02:28.280> front<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.760> because<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:30.350> looks

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
tank in front on because it looks

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.449 
tank in front on because it looks
different<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.250> each<00:02:31.910> side<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> think<00:02:34.130> that's
