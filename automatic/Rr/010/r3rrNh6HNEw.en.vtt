00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.440 

I'd<00:00:05.160> have<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.400> say<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.580> favorite<00:00:06.089> feature<00:00:06.299> on

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
I'd have to say my favorite feature on

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.000 
I'd have to say my favorite feature on
the<00:00:06.660> noodle<00:00:06.930> wall<00:00:07.020> framer<00:00:07.350> would<00:00:07.620> be<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the noodle wall framer would be the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
the noodle wall framer would be the
selection<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.000> trigger<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
selection right in the trigger for the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.890 
selection right in the trigger for the
pump-action<00:00:10.519> what<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> most<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
pump-action what I like the most is the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.790 
pump-action what I like the most is the
book<00:00:13.280> being<00:00:14.280> able<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:15.509> hands-free<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.410> feel

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
book being able to be hands-free I feel

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
book being able to be hands-free I feel
like<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> might<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.190> better<00:00:17.580> balanced<00:00:18.119> than

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
like it might be better balanced than

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.359 
like it might be better balanced than
all<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.869> framing<00:00:19.170> hours<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.740> used<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
all this framing hours I've used if it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.679 
all this framing hours I've used if it
feels<00:00:20.520> more<00:00:20.789> reliable

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
feels more reliable

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.290 
feels more reliable
it<00:00:22.439> doesn't<00:00:22.800> Jam<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> fire<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.150> would

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it doesn't Jam on this fire that would

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880 
it doesn't Jam on this fire that would
definitely<00:00:24.480> recommend<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.350> wall<00:00:25.500> frame<00:00:25.769> in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
definitely recommend the wall frame in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.210 
definitely recommend the wall frame in
our<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.820> works<00:00:27.029> every<00:00:27.570> time

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
our it works every time

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
our it works every time
it's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> lot<00:00:29.460> smaller<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.090> feel<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it's a lot smaller I feel as if it's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
it's a lot smaller I feel as if it's
probably<00:00:31.199> maybe<00:00:31.410> an<00:00:31.560> inch<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.949> smaller

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
probably maybe an inch or two smaller

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.799 
probably maybe an inch or two smaller
than<00:00:32.489> other<00:00:32.610> framers<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.180> I've<00:00:33.300> used<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
than other framers that I've used and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
than other framers that I've used and
then<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.410> weight<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.000> dramatically

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
then also the weight is dramatically

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.369 
then also the weight is dramatically
lower<00:00:36.210> than<00:00:36.540> others<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.770> durable<00:00:38.120> it's

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
lower than others it's very durable it's

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.799 
lower than others it's very durable it's
light<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:41.010> easy<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.660> some<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
light it's easy to work with some of the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
light it's easy to work with some of the
applications<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> use<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> Dewalt<00:00:44.789> frame

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
applications that I use a Dewalt frame

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
applications that I use a Dewalt frame
and<00:00:45.239> nail<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.510> four

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

nailer this is actually a single shot so
it's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.630> better<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.080> us<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.680> tools<00:01:34.950> are

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it's a lot better for us the tools are

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.150 
it's a lot better for us the tools are
top<00:01:35.850> notch<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.479> top<00:01:36.720> quality<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:37.860> very

top notch or top quality they're very
innovative<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.240> why<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.750> them

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
innovative that's why we get them

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
innovative that's why we get them
because<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.200> last<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:41.070> mean<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.910> at

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
because they last I mean if you look at

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.029 
because they last I mean if you look at
