00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
am and PM so those are the four bottles

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.100 
am and PM so those are the four bottles
that<00:00:34.350> comes<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.540> here<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> first

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that comes with and here is the first

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
that comes with and here is the first
bottle<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.800> step<00:00:41.309> 1<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> goes<00:00:42.360> through<00:00:42.629> step<00:00:42.870> 1

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
bottle or step 1 it goes through step 1

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470 
bottle or step 1 it goes through step 1
through<00:00:43.290> 4<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> step<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.239> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
through 4 and it's the step how this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
through 4 and it's the step how this
works<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.500> every<00:00:46.800> night<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> day

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
works is to use us every night and day

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.430 
works is to use us every night and day
and<00:00:48.110> by<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
and by the way you use this is first you

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.569 
and by the way you use this is first you
wet<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.530> face<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> apply<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
wet your face and then you apply this

wet your face and then you apply this
all<00:00:54.059> around<00:00:54.329> your<00:00:54.600> face<00:00:54.780> accepts<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:55.860> eyes

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all around your face accepts your eyes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
all around your face accepts your eyes
you<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> avoid<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.780> eyes<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you just have to avoid your eyes and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
then you rinse it off and then move on

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
then you rinse it off and then move on
to<00:01:00.480> step<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:02.160> move<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> step

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to step two and then we move on to step

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
to step two and then we move on to step
two<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> step<00:01:03.809> 2<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.500> uncap

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
two and in step 2 on this one you uncap

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.170 
two and in step 2 on this one you uncap
it<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> course<00:01:08.010> obviously<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.970> put

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it of course obviously and then you put

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.280 
it of course obviously and then you put
this<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:11.250> cotton<00:01:12.180> pad<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> cotton<00:01:13.140> ball

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
on to and now this is where it gets kind

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.100 
on to and now this is where it gets kind
of<00:01:32.070> difference<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> verse<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.900> night<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
of difference with a verse is night and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
morning then what you do is you apply

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.880 
morning then what you do is you apply
steps<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> three<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> let<00:01:43.649> me<00:01:43.680> talk

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
steps one two and three so let me talk

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
steps one two and three so let me talk
to<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.159> about<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> third<00:01:44.670> step<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.869> step

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to you about the third step this is step

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 
to you about the third step this is step
three<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:47.040> guy<00:01:47.159> its<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.549> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
three and this one guy its kind of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
three and this one guy its kind of
smaller<00:01:48.030> than<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> other<00:01:48.540> step<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> two

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
smaller than the other step one and two

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
smaller than the other step one and two
but<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.360> looks<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> then

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
but this what it looks like and then

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.639 
but this what it looks like and then
when<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
when you use what you do with this is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
when you use what you do with this is
you<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.920> uncap<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:56.909> apply<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you just uncap it and then apply it to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
you just uncap it and then apply it to
your<00:01:57.960> face<00:01:58.460> avoiding<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.729> eyes<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.450> just

recommend it if you have severe acne I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.250 
recommend it if you have severe acne I
do<00:04:03.820> except<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.660> don't<00:04:04.720> know<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:04.960> can<00:04:05.080> really

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
do except I don't know if you can really

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.630 
do except I don't know if you can really
see<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.710> you<00:04:05.830> can<00:04:05.980> see<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.310> some<00:04:06.520> of<00:04:06.580> my

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
see that you can see it on some of my

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.030 
see that you can see it on some of my
other<00:04:06.790> videos<00:04:06.880> but<00:04:07.360> maybe<00:04:08.110> this<00:04:08.290> one<00:04:08.530> not

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
other videos but maybe this one not

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.540 
other videos but maybe this one not
really<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:10.690> is<00:04:10.810> really<00:04:10.990> effective<00:04:11.740> for<00:04:12.430> me

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
really and it is really effective for me

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.850 
really and it is really effective for me
at<00:04:12.670> least<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.240> guess<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.840> kind<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.410> differs<00:04:14.800> from

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
at least I guess it kind of differs from

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.289 
at least I guess it kind of differs from
person<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.250> person<00:04:15.280> but<00:04:15.640> for<00:04:16.030> me<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.209> was

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
person to person but for me it was

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.930 
person to person but for me it was
really<00:04:16.360> effective<00:04:17.080> I<00:04:17.320> hope<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.280> guys<00:04:18.400> enjoyed
