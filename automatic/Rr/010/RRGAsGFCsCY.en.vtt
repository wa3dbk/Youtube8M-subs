00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.880
 I have to make a new mail art and like it 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.689
 can not stock a plot what is resolved 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 all 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.270
 and now I'll show you vote 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.800
 from the beginning without making the rhythm because 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.320
 I'm in then I don't want so let's start 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.840
 began to apply this base which 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.780
 the base is the transparent on all of them 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.220
 nails ok now I'm going to apply 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.110
 a glaze all over the place 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.390
 I personally use this cover here 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.420
 which I don't know if you live is a fuchsia in 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.950
 magenta color that came with tones 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.140
 you see this micro with 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.570
 on azure blue is michelina lasting 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.500
 color that is the enamel of unknown mussels or 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.329
 come with with his book in this 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.939
 case the framing has nothing to do with it 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.670
 the zoom however you see this fuchsia but 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.530
 you can also give another color 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 you can take black to make nail 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.509
 art style halloween then with black ad 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.639
 apply it this is all mummies and 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:31.560
 from a single pass because a glaze 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:36.520
 super super super towards covering 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.079
 I'll show you see what covers I don't 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.619
 I read it because I have a bit of nails 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:45.490
 cortini, however, to cover the free body 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.719
 of bologna for what i 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.999
 personally I have little super sales 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:57.729
 current this is the final effect 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:02:00.009
 see this very beautiful 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.520
 or a glaze on a different line for 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.039
 land and how ok after applying it 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 enamel to learn these sini glitter 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.060
 which are very small criteria 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.910
 they are very small and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.550
 small living vehicles but we could 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.110
 even winning clothes are more serious 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.260
 so much that would explain will not be able to bet 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.290
 because he can't do something you 're not e 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.390
 then I said he still managed to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:34.680
 catching me venturini finally succeeded 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:39.870
 oh well how we put them all 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:46.930
 someone upstairs then what am I going to do 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:57.490
 a long glaze base layer 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:03:07.120
 transparent shop and take the cerino 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:11.910
 the rich in another spin on a 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.910
 ancient ok kg peak to the side 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:30.780
 help another unit side by side when 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:35.370
 don't create too much detachment between him and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:47.370
 glitter then another myth under the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:52.400
 first other under the second opens 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.400
 well attached finetto 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.519
 so much so 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.590
 see I have done very very much 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.610
 much for him not too excessive 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.980
 because logically I do it 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.230
 on the ring finger do not cancel inch but 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.030
 only on the ring finger but then asks 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.840
 quietly do it even on the thumb 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.820
 in short, I decided to do it too 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.300
 then make a mistake about what was done and go 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.920
 to do it from this scale ok then that 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.840
 doctrine but in order to arrange to mine 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.240
 liking so I answered I have it 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 already arranged you like them 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.890
 you are first this is the fly effect e 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 inch 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.050
 now I dry for a few minutes 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.370
 and the glitter dinners because you know 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.140
 just as bright tonight is not done 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.030
 to disconnect then I go from depriving yours 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.010
 body of on the rest of the nails if it is 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.380
 do only from the sea then to apply a 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.410
 maybe violate every other two 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.420
 blond otherwise leave it so want 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.580
 do it any other color if you have 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.980
 that the fuchs trains and sterile applications 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.110
 fox has therefore the same you can do with 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.850
 a peak to make 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.810
 ok now I'm going to get this top 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.480
 coat that my usual and m3 janis of 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.340
 stagion itf of many things because 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.280
 always use this for this 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.070
 point cota with 2 with two passes from a 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.630
 gel effect in fact many people there 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.630
 most of the time they never tell me 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.800
 inaugurated at the gel coverage and me 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.250
 I said no 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.170
 then wind power and it's my secret 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.170
 I will reveal it in the south 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:48.560
 and shiny and then also how it is said and 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:51.040
 I did as they say the networks quickly 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.040
 nail varnish 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.840
 so I leave you I hope my vi 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.760
 both liked and let me know with a 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.380
 comment leaves you a thousand basin on a 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.660
 basin hopefully just that the image given 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.660
