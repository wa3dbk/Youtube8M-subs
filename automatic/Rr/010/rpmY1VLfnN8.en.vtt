00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you need to stretch it a little bit so

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.410 
you need to stretch it a little bit so
it<00:01:42.009> gets<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.280> little<00:01:42.490> bit<00:01:42.579> tacky<00:01:42.819> as<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.240> wrap

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
it gets a little bit tacky as you wrap

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.230 
it gets a little bit tacky as you wrap
it<00:01:43.599> so<00:01:43.810> hold<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.349> tight<00:01:44.590> pull<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:45.700> around<00:01:45.969> give

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
it so hold it tight pull it around give

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.059 
it so hold it tight pull it around give
it<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.390> little<00:01:46.539> bit<00:01:46.659> of<00:01:46.719> a<00:01:46.810> stretch<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.560> it's

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:59.620 
it a little bit of a stretch and it's
just<00:01:48.310> sticks<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.700> itself

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
just sticking the flowers any old where

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.170 
just sticking the flowers any old where
when<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.440> started<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.430> lightly

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
when you get started just lightly

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.300 
when you get started just lightly
roughly<00:02:27.810> lay<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.530> where<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.220> them

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
roughly lay them out where you want them

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.490 
roughly lay them out where you want them
to<00:02:29.489> go<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> crown<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:31.049> will<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.319> help

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to go on the crown it will just help

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.470 
to go on the crown it will just help
when<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.799> comes<00:02:31.829> to<00:02:32.250> gluing<00:02:32.940> them<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.239> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
when it comes to gluing them on and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.539 
when it comes to gluing them on and
taping<00:02:33.750> up<00:02:33.989> later<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:35.040> move<00:02:35.190> them<00:02:35.340> slightly

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
taping up later just move them slightly

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.160 
taping up later just move them slightly
out<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.910> way<00:02:36.060> keeping<00:02:36.390> them<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.629> order<00:02:39.170> now

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
out of the way keeping them in order now

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.869 
out of the way keeping them in order now
always<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.860> start<00:02:41.129> at<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> very<00:02:41.610> front

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
always like to start at the very front

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.479 
always like to start at the very front
and<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.870> always<00:02:43.079> face<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.440> stem<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and I always face the stem of the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.119 
and I always face the stem of the
flowers<00:02:44.940> back<00:02:45.239> towards<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.769> back<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
flowers back towards the back of the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.110 
flowers back towards the back of the
crown<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.890> find<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.310> technique<00:02:50.819> as<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
crown I just find this technique as you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.270 
crown I just find this technique as you
layer<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:52.079> easier<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.590> wrap<00:02:52.799> rather<00:02:53.099> than

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
layer up it's easier to wrap rather than

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.589 
layer up it's easier to wrap rather than
trying<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.579> get<00:02:53.700> between<00:02:53.879> all<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.299> flowers

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
trying to get between all the flowers

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.949 
trying to get between all the flowers
and<00:02:54.989> wrap<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.379> tape<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.390> I've<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.510> hot

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
and wrap with the tape so I've just hot

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.380 
and wrap with the tape so I've just hot
glued<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:59.099> can<00:02:59.250> glue<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.489> put<00:02:59.879> the<00:02:59.970> glue<00:03:00.150> onto

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
glued you can glue it put the glue onto

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.849 
glued you can glue it put the glue onto
the<00:03:00.569> flower<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.349> put<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.590> onto<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
the flower or you can put it onto the

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.559 
the flower or you can put it onto the
stem<00:03:02.099> whichever<00:03:02.430> way<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.609> feel<00:03:02.849> easy<00:03:03.120> is

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
stem whichever way you feel easy is

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.199 
stem whichever way you feel easy is
easiest<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.380> each<00:03:04.590> flower<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.090> I'm

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
easiest for each flower and then I'm

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.759 
easiest for each flower and then I'm
just<00:03:06.329> going<00:03:06.540> through<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.319> I've<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.590> wrapped

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
just going through and I've just wrapped

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.589 
just going through and I've just wrapped
that<00:03:07.950> tape<00:03:08.160> around<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:08.639> remember<00:03:09.030> stretch

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
that tape around just remember stretch

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.809 
that tape around just remember stretch
that<00:03:09.780> tape<00:03:09.989> out<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> bit<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.769> before<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.700> go

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that tape out a bit and before you go

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.460 
that tape out a bit and before you go
sticking<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> next<00:03:12.510> flower<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:13.109> roughly

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
sticking on the next flower just roughly

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.349 
sticking on the next flower just roughly
have<00:03:13.919> a<00:03:13.980> look<00:03:14.160> first<00:03:14.459> where<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:14.940> going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> go

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
have a look first where it's going to go

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.110 
have a look first where it's going to go
and<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.349> apply<00:03:16.620> your<00:03:16.650> glue<00:03:17.069> stick<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
and then apply your glue stick the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.449 
and then apply your glue stick the
flower<00:03:18.329> down<00:03:18.630> does<00:03:19.349> take<00:03:19.530> about<00:03:19.650> 30<00:03:20.010> seconds

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
flower down does take about 30 seconds

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.949 
flower down does take about 30 seconds
for<00:03:20.609> that<00:03:20.760> glue<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> dry<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.569> just<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.810> really

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
for that glue to dry and just be really

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.740 
for that glue to dry and just be really
careful<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.739> extremely<00:03:23.099> hot

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.390 

go<00:03:27.750> through<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.380> slightly<00:03:28.800> overlap

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
go through and just slightly overlap

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.370 
go through and just slightly overlap
each<00:03:29.640> flower<00:03:30.000> behind<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.660> other<00:03:30.780> flower<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
each flower behind the other flower and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:04:42.300 
each flower behind the other flower and
remember<00:03:31.770> stem<00:03:32.010> facing<00:03:32.520> back

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.129 

now<00:04:43.310> just<00:04:43.520> filling<00:04:43.759> up<00:04:43.819> that<00:04:43.879> right<00:04:44.300> side<00:04:44.629> so

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
now just filling up that right side so

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.050 
now just filling up that right side so
it<00:04:45.289> same<00:04:45.590> thing<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:46.220> face<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:46.669> flowers

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
it same thing just face this flowers

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.950 
it same thing just face this flowers

back and can't remember glue tastes
about<00:04:53.930> 30<00:04:54.169> seconds<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.680> just<00:04:57.889> let<00:04:58.009> it<00:04:58.039> dry

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
about 30 seconds so just let it dry

about 30 seconds so just let it dry
first<00:04:58.879> before<00:04:59.120> wrapping
