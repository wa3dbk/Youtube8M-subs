00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:06.049
 and he gave you life when you were dead in your crimes and 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.849
 sins in which you walked says in another time following the current of 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.239
 this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.380
 operates in the children of disobedience 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.779
 among which all of us also lived in another time in the desires of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 our flesh doing the will of the flesh and the thoughts and we were 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019
 by nature children of anger the same as others 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love with which he still loved us 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.670
 being dead in sins gave us life together with Christ 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 by grace I am saved 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 and together with him he resurrected us and also made us sit down in the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.300
 Places the summer with Christ Jesus 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.350
 to show in the coming centuries the abundant riches of his grace in his 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.019
 goodness 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.750
 for us in Christ Jesus 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.890
 because thanks o and saved by faith 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.810
 and this not from you 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.610
 it is a gift of God 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.550
 not for works so nobody can boast 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.350
 because we are his work created in Christ Jesus for good works 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 which God prepared in advance for us to have in them 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.289
 so 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.159
 remember that in the past you Gentiles as to the flesh was 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.520
 that uncircumcised call by the so-called circumcision 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670
 made by hand in the flesh 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.660
 at that time was iss without christ away from the citizenship of israel 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.049
 and oblivious to the covenants of promise 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.850
 without hope and without god in the world 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.909
 but now in Jesus Christ you who once was away is away 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.940
 been made close by the blood of Christ 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.580
 because he is our peace I stayed both peoples made one by knocking down the wall 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.230
 separation intermediate 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.240
 abolishing in his card the enmities the law of the commandments expressed in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.330
 ordinances to create in cynicism of the two 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.990
 a single and new man 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 making peace 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.899
 and through the cross reconcile with God both in one body killing in it 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.449
 the enmities 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.770
 and he came and announced the good news of peace to you who was far away 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.489
 and those who were close 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.960
 because through him 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.810
 we both have an entrance through the same spirit to the father 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.219
 so you are no longer foreigners or upstarts if you do not consider us of the 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.150
 saints and members of the family of God built on the foundation of the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.669
 apostles and prophets 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.319
 being the main corner stone Jesus Christ himself in whom all the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.699
