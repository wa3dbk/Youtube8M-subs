little poly cap ball joint right there
and<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.780> much<00:02:03.840> Wiggles<00:02:04.320> side<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> side

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and it pretty much Wiggles side to side

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.330 
and it pretty much Wiggles side to side
like<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.579> spins<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
like that spins and up and down like

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.839 
like that spins and up and down like
that<00:02:08.479> arm<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.200> high<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that arm can go about that high up and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.089 
that arm can go about that high up and
then

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
then

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.699 
then
that's<00:02:13.459> pretty<00:02:14.030> much<00:02:14.120> as<00:02:14.329> far<00:02:14.629> as<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.989> are<00:02:15.409> can

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
that's pretty much as far as the are can

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.330 
that's pretty much as far as the are can
go<00:02:16.219> really<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.109> that's<00:02:18.109> due<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.859> the<00:02:19.010> arm

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
go really and that's due to the arm

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.729 
go really and that's due to the arm
design<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.840> shoulder<00:02:21.109> armor<00:02:21.409> which<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.620> a

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
design of the shoulder armor which is a

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.140 
design of the shoulder armor which is a
very<00:02:22.280> unfortunate<00:02:22.609> thing<00:02:22.879> for<00:02:23.060> fast<00:02:23.930> right<00:02:24.230> so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
very unfortunate thing for fast right so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.599 
very unfortunate thing for fast right so
here<00:02:26.150> we're<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:26.989> his<00:02:27.499> little<00:02:27.920> arm<00:02:28.159> can<00:02:28.459> only

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
here we're here his little arm can only

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.089 
here we're here his little arm can only
go<00:02:28.849> about<00:02:28.969> that<00:02:29.239> far<00:02:29.299> yet<00:02:30.139> again<00:02:30.439> due<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.769> this

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
go about that far yet again due to this

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.420 
go about that far yet again due to this
normal<00:02:31.310> armor<00:02:31.819> design<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.920> about<00:02:34.280> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
normal armor design it's going about a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.550 
normal armor design it's going about a
90<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.939> can<00:02:35.060> go<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.239> lot<00:02:35.510> more<00:02:35.780> due<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.439> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
90 it can go a lot more due to the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.069 
90 it can go a lot more due to the
original<00:02:37.129> design<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.549> astray<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.299> and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
original design of the astray but and

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.740 
original design of the astray but and
due<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.919> design<00:02:40.219> again<00:02:40.549> it's<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.060> but

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
due to the design again it's just but

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.270 
due to the design again it's just but
you<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.169> want<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.739> turn<00:02:42.889> to<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.129> side

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you if you want you can turn to the side

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.449 
you if you want you can turn to the side
it<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.609> do<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.510> lot<00:02:44.569> better<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.219> front

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
but anyways hopefully a massive grade

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.379

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
elements it's really cool it's just that

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.189 
elements it's really cool it's just that
it's<00:05:22.490> really<00:05:22.699> a<00:05:23.000> little<00:05:23.300> bit<00:05:23.479> hindered<00:05:23.870> due<00:05:23.900> to

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
it's really a little bit hindered due to

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.800 
it's really a little bit hindered due to
the<00:05:24.590> shoulder<00:05:25.099> armors<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.759> the<00:05:26.449> way<00:05:26.599> they

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
the shoulder armors and the way they

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.110 
the shoulder armors and the way they
design<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.319> pieces<00:05:27.710> how<00:05:27.860> they<00:05:28.069> are<00:05:28.310> put<00:05:28.849> on<00:05:28.940> to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
design the pieces how they are put on to

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.600 
design the pieces how they are put on to
the<00:05:29.240> actual<00:05:29.539> model<00:05:29.840> kit<00:05:29.990> but<00:05:30.380> yeah<00:05:30.830> overall

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
the actual model kit but yeah overall

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.999 
the actual model kit but yeah overall
thoughts<00:05:32.060> it's<00:05:32.780> pretty<00:05:32.990> good<00:05:33.139> kit<00:05:33.409> it's<00:05:33.710> not<00:05:33.830> a

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
thoughts it's pretty good kit it's not a

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.550 
thoughts it's pretty good kit it's not a
really<00:05:34.729> must<00:05:35.090> buy<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.840> only<00:05:35.990> thing<00:05:36.289> I<00:05:36.380> will

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
really must buy the only thing I will

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.740 
really must buy the only thing I will
suggest<00:05:37.130> is<00:05:37.550> go<00:05:37.969> after<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.360> Master<00:05:38.630> Grade

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
suggest is go after the Master Grade

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.059 
suggest is go after the Master Grade
because<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.199> master<00:05:39.380> grade<00:05:39.590> will<00:05:39.740> most

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
because the master grade will most

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.920 
because the master grade will most
likely<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:40.699> correct<00:05:41.150> all<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.449> issues<00:05:41.750> on

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
likely like correct all the issues on

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.019 
likely like correct all the issues on
this<00:05:42.080> guy<00:05:42.229> hopefully<00:05:42.889> because<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:43.789> don't<00:05:43.969> have

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029
