integrated<00:00:25.140> into<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.500> already<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.699> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
integrated into it already but this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.779 
integrated into it already but this
gameplay<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.720> pretty<00:00:28.650> sick<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.160> end<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.580> going

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
gameplay was pretty sick I end up going

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630 
gameplay was pretty sick I end up going
like<00:00:30.410> 32<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.560> 3<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:31.920> something<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> that's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
like 32 and 3 or something and that's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
like 32 and 3 or something and that's
weird<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.420> cranked<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.290> go

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
weird because in cranked if you don't go

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
weird because in cranked if you don't go
on<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.649> initial<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.399> spree<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.750> very

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
on that initial first spree it's very

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
on that initial first spree it's very
very<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.530> difficult<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.550> drop<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
very very difficult to actually drop a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
very very difficult to actually drop a
Kem<00:00:39.329> strike<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.350> quickly

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Kem strike just because of how quickly

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
Kem strike just because of how quickly
the<00:00:40.890> games<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> points<00:00:42.000> add<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the games go how the points add up to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
the games go how the points add up to
kills<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.110> mean<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.860> kill<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.399> points<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
kills I mean one kill is two points and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.100 
kills I mean one kill is two points and
there's<00:00:45.030> only<00:00:45.180> 100<00:00:45.570> points<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> game

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
there's only 100 points in a game

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.569 
there's only 100 points in a game
whenever<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.649> cranked<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.399> one

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
whenever you're cranked and it's one

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.799 
whenever you're cranked and it's one
point<00:00:47.789> whenever<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.300> cranked<00:00:48.629> but

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
point whenever you're not cranked but

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
point whenever you're not cranked but
still<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.520> whenever

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
still that's not a lot and whenever

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.310 
still that's not a lot and whenever
you're<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.059> streak<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.170> get

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you're on a streak like that if you get

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
you're on a streak like that if you get
25<00:00:52.710> kills<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.190> literally<00:00:53.489> 50<00:00:53.910> points<00:00:54.270> for

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
25 kills that's literally 50 points for

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.160 
25 kills that's literally 50 points for
your<00:00:54.600> team

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
your team

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
your team
well<00:00:55.800> 49<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> guess<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> initial

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
well 49 I guess because of the initial

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
well 49 I guess because of the initial
kill<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.829> difficult<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
kill but it's really really difficult to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
kill but it's really really difficult to
get<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> don't<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.660> initial

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
get if you don't go on that initial

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
get if you don't go on that initial
spree<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.770> said<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> pretty

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
spree like I said so this was a pretty

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
spree like I said so this was a pretty
sweet<00:01:03.750> game<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.589> taken<00:01:04.949> out

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
an absolute beast I never really gave it

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.630 
an absolute beast I never really gave it
a<00:03:05.310> fair<00:03:05.580> chance<00:03:05.610> until<00:03:06.330> last<00:03:06.720> night<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.640> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
a fair chance until last night and it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
a fair chance until last night and it
really<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.720> great<00:03:09.990> gun<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.710> use<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.550> range

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
really is a great gun to use the range

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.700 
really is a great gun to use the range
on<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.270> really<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:12.990> good<00:03:13.290> even<00:03:13.560> though

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
on it is really really good even though

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.980 
on it is really really good even though
it<00:03:13.770> has<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.950> silencer<00:03:14.660> sometimes<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.870> to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
it has a silencer sometimes you have to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.960 
it has a silencer sometimes you have to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
tap it to get the range to get your

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.760 
tap it to get the range to get your
recoil<00:03:18.270> good<00:03:18.600> because<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.230> know<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.500> range

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
recoil good because you know the range

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.640 
recoil good because you know the range
is<00:03:20.180> sometimes<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.300> little<00:03:21.360> bit<00:03:21.540> shaky<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.440> um

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
is sometimes a little bit shaky but um

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680 
is sometimes a little bit shaky but um
it's<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.490> really<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:23.940> good<00:03:24.180> hybrid<00:03:24.600> it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
it's a really really good hybrid it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.960 
it's a really really good hybrid it
feels<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.080> an<00:03:25.200> SMG<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:25.980> an<00:03:26.070> AR<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.940> I

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
feels like an SMG but it's an AR so I

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.850 
feels like an SMG but it's an AR so I
can<00:03:27.120> snipe<00:03:27.330> my<00:03:27.570> god<00:03:27.810> skull<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.590> really

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
can snipe my god skull it's really

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.960 
can snipe my god skull it's really
ridiculous<00:03:29.160> right<00:03:29.459> here<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.790> somebody

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
ridiculous right here we have somebody

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.520 
ridiculous right here we have somebody
in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.270> game<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.570> actually<00:03:30.810> knew<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.320> so

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530

dropping a Kem on someone that knew I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.640 
dropping a Kem on someone that knew I
was<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.510> much<00:03:33.780> more<00:03:33.959> rewarding<00:03:34.110> because
