00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 I watched amusingly and had a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
 A lot of children crying and screaming at 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.700
 movie theater 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 Good, I know the children's movie more 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.540
 even so he a little bit of silence 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 country as you were afraid to lose 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 some part of the movie I was quiet and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 I attended Lisbon with all that child. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.050
 together and I even cried in the end a movie 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.109
 It's very very good. 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.849
 Hi it's starting but, Victor 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.489
 talking about the movie I liked 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 a lot that I watched recently 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 amusingly disney and pizza 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
 the movie talks about a girl called 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.829
 high law that just turned 11 years old and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.059
 Good your on your head 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.059
 They are movie characters. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.260
 This is the sadness of that branch. 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.960
 these five characters make a mix of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 feelings of anger or that's all I want 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.550
 teenager in the film is because of a 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.480
 of these characters who stay and live 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 inside her head 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.710
 the film is not so childish so is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.540
 staff because an animation as all 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.280
 pixar movies is not just because it 's a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.050
 animation that is a movie for children and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.390
 I'm going to talk to you so much fun then 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.060
 my top 5 of favorite pizza movies 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.530
 our but surely the film 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.750
 explain how we have so many 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.440
 emotions in the day and how the things that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.690
 We feel in life, dreams come true. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:39.770
 imaginary friends deja vu e e 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:41.450
 unexplained or confused feelings and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.950
 role in adventure of quota-part set 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.960
 also been asking for everything has a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 logical explanation and with a bit of 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.280
 philosophy and psychology behind 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 amusingly is a movie that makes you 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.690
 think and what reminds you that when 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.210
 you're a teenager you understand there 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.759
 a lot about yourself and about the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.590
 people around you that make you 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.899
 He sent down with time all 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.060
 happens in the life of the aig and the valley is like 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.380
 if you were an agent in the mirror 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.119
 another super cool thing about 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.130
 amusingly the publicity that the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.930
 disney made on top of the characters they 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.610
 they used each feeling with each 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.200
 an argument we use on a daily basis 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.660
 on social networks along with the hashtag 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.080
 would be the name of the characters stayed type 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.080
 so 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:39.500
 ah there is a character who steals the scene in 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.580
 a character like that what time is it 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.520
 the saddest of all the movie is this 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.560
 moment the character the big bob 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.690
 just the cutest thing on the floor 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.660
 this guy here with the cotton body 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.460
 sweet half dolphin half cat half 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.380
 he is an imaginary friend of the 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.720
 rone and I remember when I had my friend 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.520
 imaginary that ultimately if I try 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.900
 draw and now it will be horrible and it 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 so I asked my friend pro 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 to draw other feelings that I found 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.650
 That they lacked at least for me. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.030
 beyond joy sadness fear disgust and 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.370
 Anger I thought I was missing 33 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.170
 feelings that describe me totally 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.450
 I asked my friend TainÃ£, my friend . 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.860
 hence his instagram to do then 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.260
 these drawings for me because the guy 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.330
 manja but manja very draws very well 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.520
 So I asked him to make the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.130
 this guy here with four arms 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.780
 because two arms are not enough 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.430
 for us to kill our hunger and eat 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
 everything that we want the same time for 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 less for me hunger is a feeling that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.450
 It represents me too much 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650
 The second is sleep, this guy here. 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.960
 can you see he's wearing a T-shirt 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.270
 Giant One Sleeping Face Holding On 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.550
 alone to cover the obvious is what makes 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.070
 cold and serious or not is such a thing 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.310
 I just do not sleep anymore because I 'm not 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.040
 a marmot with a bear that berna half 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.930
 of sleep for sure this reason wrote 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.630
 decide now would be sleeping and people 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.670
 goes now to the third which is good not 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.840
 I know what you call it, I'd say 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.310
 there the strength of will that is the force is me 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 help there in the comments how I 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.880
 could be called third character 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.040
 but it's this guy here 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.230
 he is every gate using regatta and is the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.240
 face that makes me love sports love 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.340
 exercise and that makes me go to 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.710
 gym every day at the end of the day when 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.990
 I am already exhausted and in the total drawing is 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.240
 holding an apple causing hunger 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.760
 the ground is in the middle of the light having nothing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.160
 Dear 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.080
 and so get the other feelings that 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.090
 I think they represent and with certainty 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.720
 represent a lot of people from the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.910
 world 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.460
 Thank you Tainan and thank you 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.080

 falls within the general arrivals're not 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.850
 Good guys, I have disgust but also 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.850
 prevents it from happening occurred
