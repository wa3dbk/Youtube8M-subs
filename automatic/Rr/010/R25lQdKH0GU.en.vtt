neutral and then to get into reverse you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
neutral and then to get into reverse you
can't<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.180> right<00:00:57.180> down<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.660> here

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
can't really see it right down in here

can't really see it right down in here
inside<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> boot<00:00:58.859> there's<00:00:59.640> another<00:00:59.969> lever

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
inside the boot there's another lever

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.579 
inside the boot there's another lever
which<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.020> release<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.280> reverse

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
which will release it to go into reverse

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.940 
which will release it to go into reverse
push<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:06.030> you're<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.270> reverse<00:01:06.950> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
push there now you're in reverse you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.570 
push there now you're in reverse you
want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> park<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.619> then<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
can see the detent lever has been

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
can see the detent lever has been
reversed<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.259> used<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> other

reversed that used to be on the other

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.670 
reversed that used to be on the other
side<00:01:17.310> which<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> course<00:01:18.450> created<00:01:19.049> problems

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
side which of course created problems

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.590
