two<00:00:07.299> necks<00:00:07.540> out<00:00:07.720> here<00:00:07.990> and<00:00:09.719> my

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
two necks out here and my

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.150 
two necks out here and my
that<00:00:11.750> we<00:00:11.840> don't<00:00:12.080> use<00:00:12.290> to<00:00:12.500> build<00:00:12.650> guitars<00:00:12.830> with

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
that we don't use to build guitars with

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.870 
that we don't use to build guitars with
and<00:00:13.370> a<00:00:14.680> couple<00:00:15.680> of<00:00:15.799> blanks<00:00:16.070> these<00:00:16.279> two<00:00:16.460> blanks

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
and a couple of blanks these two blanks

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.420 
and a couple of blanks these two blanks
are<00:00:17.000> very<00:00:17.480> similar<00:00:17.930> but<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.950> difference<00:00:19.279> of

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
are very similar but the difference of

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.950 
are very similar but the difference of
these<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:19.820> don't<00:00:19.880> know<00:00:20.060> if<00:00:20.119> you<00:00:20.210> can<00:00:20.270> in<00:00:20.810> the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
these and I don't know if you can in the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.429 
these and I don't know if you can in the
shot

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
shot

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.350 
shot
these<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.250> grain<00:00:22.700> on<00:00:22.880> these<00:00:23.029> are<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> little

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
these the grain on these are a little

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.269 
these the grain on these are a little
different<00:00:23.630> this<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.590> is<00:00:24.710> what<00:00:25.009> we<00:00:25.099> call<00:00:25.250> a

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
different this is this is what we call a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.170 
different this is this is what we call a
flats<00:00:25.640> on<00:00:27.189> blank<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.430> this<00:00:28.550> is<00:00:28.730> what<00:00:28.939> we<00:00:29.029> call

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
flats on blank and this is what we call

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.220 
flats on blank and this is what we call
a<00:00:29.210> quarter<00:00:29.570> sawn<00:00:29.779> blank

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
a quarter sawn blank

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.819 
a quarter sawn blank
now<00:00:30.500> these<00:00:31.250> neck<00:00:31.640> blanks<00:00:32.029> are<00:00:32.180> about<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.590> same

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
now these neck blanks are about the same

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.340 
now these neck blanks are about the same
they're<00:00:34.309> about<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.670> same<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.360> looked<00:00:36.140> at<00:00:36.260> them

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
they're about the same I looked at them

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.420 
they're about the same I looked at them
before<00:00:36.440> we<00:00:36.710> brought<00:00:36.890> them<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.160> they're<00:00:37.280> about

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
before we brought them and they're about

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.889 
before we brought them and they're about
the<00:00:37.610> same<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:37.940> one's<00:00:38.090> about<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:38.570> about<00:00:38.780> it

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
the same this one's about it's about it

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.490 
the same this one's about it's about it
I'd<00:00:39.380> say<00:00:39.559> probably<00:00:39.739> 1/8<00:00:40.280> inch<00:00:40.520> taller<00:00:41.210> but<00:00:42.020> all

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
I'd say probably 1/8 inch taller but all

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.740 
I'd say probably 1/8 inch taller but all
that<00:00:42.770> being<00:00:42.890> said<00:00:42.980> was<00:00:43.309> was<00:00:44.060> how<00:00:44.330> they<00:00:44.480> sound

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
that being said was was how they sound

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.930 
that being said was was how they sound
because<00:00:45.080> there<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.710> some<00:00:45.860> variables<00:00:46.640> in<00:00:46.730> wood

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
because there is some variables in wood

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:59.380 
because there is some variables in wood
too<00:00:56.860> clearly<00:00:57.860> has<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.100> note<00:00:58.340> there<00:00:58.610> let<00:00:59.120> me<00:00:59.240> hit

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
too clearly has a note there let me hit

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.609 
too clearly has a note there let me hit
this<00:00:59.510> one<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:05.030> has<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.320> little<00:01:06.320> bit<00:01:06.409> lower

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
this one this has a little bit lower

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.389 
this one this has a little bit lower
resonant<00:01:07.130> frequency<00:01:07.579> so<00:01:08.439> even<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:09.740> even<00:01:10.040> at

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
resonant frequency so even so even at

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.990 
resonant frequency so even so even at
the<00:01:10.520> necks<00:01:11.000> are<00:01:12.460> about<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.579> same<00:01:13.790> size

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the necks are about the same size

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.830 
the necks are about the same size
they're<00:01:14.720> once<00:01:15.229> once<00:01:15.680> quarter<00:01:16.190> sawn<00:01:16.400> once

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
they're once once quarter sawn once

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.899 
they're once once quarter sawn once
flats<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:18.080> they<00:01:18.979> still<00:01:19.280> sound<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.790> little

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
flats on they still sound a little

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.100 
flats on they still sound a little
different<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.510> you're<00:01:20.630> going<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.780> get<00:01:20.960> that

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
different and you're going to get that

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.649 
different and you're going to get that
from<00:01:21.260> blank<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.680> blank<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:22.070> blank<00:01:22.190> but<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
from blank to blank to blank but the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.480 
from blank to blank to blank but the
thing<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.229> need<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.440> remember<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
thing that you need to remember on the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.969 
thing that you need to remember on the
cuts<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:25.970> wood<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:27.530> they're<00:01:27.740> going

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
cuts of the wood is that they're going

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.590 
cuts of the wood is that they're going
to<00:01:28.130> react<00:01:28.430> differently<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.240> they<00:01:29.330> put<00:01:29.510> on

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
to react differently when they put on

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.980 
to react differently when they put on
guitars<00:01:30.850> because<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.030> stiffer<00:01:32.420> piece<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.840> wood

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
guitars because a stiffer piece of wood

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.870 
guitars because a stiffer piece of wood
which<00:01:33.260> would<00:01:33.409> be<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.680> quarters<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
which would be the quarters or the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.550 
which would be the quarters or the
quarter<00:01:35.150> sawn<00:01:35.330> piece<00:01:35.510> of<00:01:35.630> wood<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.960> stiffer

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
quarter sawn piece of wood a stiffer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.020 
quarter sawn piece of wood a stiffer
piece<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.890> wood<00:01:37.010> is<00:01:37.130> going<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.549> give<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:38.000> a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
piece of wood is going to give you a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.990 
piece of wood is going to give you a
higher<00:01:38.360> sound<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:39.620> I<00:01:39.799> was<00:01:39.950> going<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.220> now

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
higher sound so if I was going to now

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.670 
higher sound so if I was going to now
this<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.360> what<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.600> call<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.930> tone<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.500> tone

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
this is what I call the tone the tone

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.859 
this is what I call the tone the tone
booyah<00:01:43.130> base<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.909> if<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.119> was<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.570> sit

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
booyah base so if I was going to sit

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.810 
booyah base so if I was going to sit
here<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.260> I<00:01:45.560> have<00:01:45.740> these<00:01:45.860> two<00:01:45.920> blanks<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.700> have

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
here and I have these two blanks I have

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.060 
here and I have these two blanks I have
one<00:01:47.000> that's<00:01:47.180> that's<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.810> stiffer<00:01:50.890> quarter<00:01:51.890> sawn

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
one that's that's a stiffer quarter sawn

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.070 
one that's that's a stiffer quarter sawn
blank<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:53.000> one<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.630> flat

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
blank and I have one that is a flat

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.859 
blank and I have one that is a flat
sound<00:01:54.290> blank<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.600> lighter<00:01:56.600> body

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
sound blank and I have a lighter body

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.600 
sound blank and I have a lighter body
and<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:58.840> little<00:01:59.840> heavier<00:02:00.110> body<00:02:00.409> then<00:02:01.010> what<00:02:01.580> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and a little heavier body then what I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.340 
and a little heavier body then what I
can<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.299> I<00:02:02.570> can<00:02:02.810> sit<00:02:02.990> there<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.170> say

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
can do is I can I can sit there and say

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.780 
can do is I can I can sit there and say
okay<00:02:03.560> well<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.799> one<00:02:04.010> has<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.220> lower<00:02:04.430> rate<00:02:04.700> of

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
okay well this one has a lower rate of

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.899 
okay well this one has a lower rate of
sort<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:04.970> frequency<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:05.510> I'd<00:02:05.720> put<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:05.990> on

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
sort of frequency so I'd put that on

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.130 
sort of frequency so I'd put that on
probably<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> alder<00:02:08.299> body<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.929> are

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
probably the alder body that are

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.710 
probably the alder body that are
probably<00:02:09.799> on<00:02:10.060> note<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.390> older<00:02:11.599> body

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
probably on note on the older body

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.479 
probably on note on the older body
because<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.739> has<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> higher<00:02:13.129> resonant

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
because it has a higher resonant

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.100 
because it has a higher resonant
frequency<00:02:13.909> so<00:02:14.060> now<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:14.299> compensating<00:02:14.689> for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
frequency so now I'm compensating for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.929 
frequency so now I'm compensating for
frequencies<00:02:15.590> here<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.549> really<00:02:16.790> good

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
frequencies here this is really good

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.979 
frequencies here this is really good
like<00:02:17.750> science<00:02:18.200> project<00:02:18.799> stuff<00:02:19.069> sorry<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:20.329> and

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
like science project stuff sorry but and

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.250 
like science project stuff sorry but and
then<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.889> this<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:23.150> stiff<00:02:23.480> chorus

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
then you have this really stiff chorus

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.300 
then you have this really stiff chorus
on<00:02:24.409> blank

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
on blank

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.190 
on blank
this<00:02:25.430> body<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> lower<00:02:26.660> resident

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
this body that's got a lower resident

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.240 
this body that's got a lower resident
frequency<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> put<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.099> neck<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:28.730> here<00:02:29.060> now

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
frequency I put this neck on here now

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.890 
frequency I put this neck on here now
that's<00:02:31.250> these<00:02:31.849> these<00:02:32.150> two<00:02:32.209> guitars<00:02:32.750> are

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
that's these these two guitars are

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.820 
that's these these two guitars are
probably<00:02:33.110> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.319> sound<00:02:33.440> really<00:02:33.590> really

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
probably going to sound really really

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.110 
probably going to sound really really
good<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.310> wouldn't<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:40.400> personally

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
good I wouldn't do this just personally

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.800 
good I wouldn't do this just personally
I<00:02:41.180> wouldn't<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.569> because<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.769> that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
I wouldn't do that because I know that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.390 
I wouldn't do that because I know that
this<00:02:44.810> guitar<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> rain<00:02:45.890> differently

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
this guitar is going to rain differently

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.220 
this guitar is going to rain differently
because<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.910> flats<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:49.030> blank<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.239> this

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
because of that flats on blank and this

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.770 
because of that flats on blank and this
guitar<00:02:51.590> at<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:51.950> guitars<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:53.239> know<00:02:53.360> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
guitar at this guitars you know it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.940 
guitar at this guitars you know it's
going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.989> be<00:02:54.080> real<00:02:54.260> bright<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.830> don't

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
going to be real bright and I don't

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.740 
going to be real bright and I don't
really<00:02:55.130> want<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> want<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> do<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.209> that's

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
really want to want to do that so that's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.780 
really want to want to do that so that's
how<00:02:56.870> that's<00:02:57.350> how<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.560> would<00:02:57.739> that's<00:02:58.549> how<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
how that's how I would that's how I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.690 
how that's how I would that's how I
build<00:02:59.120> those<00:02:59.239> two<00:02:59.390> guitars<00:02:59.690> now<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.430> thing<00:03:01.670> is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
build those two guitars now the thing is

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.190 
build those two guitars now the thing is
is<00:03:01.970> once<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.269> start<00:03:02.299> that's<00:03:02.750> not<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> knack

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
is once you start that's not a knack

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.920 
is once you start that's not a knack
once<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.040> start<00:03:04.280> cutting<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> into<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.120> now

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
once you start cutting it into this now

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:17.920 
once you start cutting it into this now
you<00:03:05.989> really<00:03:06.380> get<00:03:06.500> into<00:03:16.390> different<00:03:17.390> next<00:03:17.660> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
you really get into different next this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.630 
you really get into different next this
is<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.140> lower<00:03:18.349> frit<00:03:18.650> resonant<00:03:19.040> frequency<00:03:19.489> than

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
is a lower frit resonant frequency than

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.729 
is a lower frit resonant frequency than
this<00:03:19.760> one<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> quarter<00:03:20.930> son<00:03:21.170> has<00:03:21.709> a

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
this one this is a quarter son has a

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.979 
this one this is a quarter son has a
bigger<00:03:22.069> peg<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.730> more<00:03:23.180> mass<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.690> here

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
bigger peg on it more mass in here

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.979 
bigger peg on it more mass in here
hasn't<00:03:24.769> been<00:03:24.890> shaped<00:03:25.220> yet<00:03:25.430> either<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.910> it's<00:03:26.569> a

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
hasn't been shaped yet either so it's a

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.120 
hasn't been shaped yet either so it's a
little<00:03:27.140> different<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.709> has<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> rosewood

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
little different this has a rosewood

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.849 
little different this has a rosewood
fingerboard<00:03:28.400> on<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.140> flat<00:03:30.350> lamb<00:03:30.590> a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
fingerboard on it and it's a flat lamb a

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.880 
fingerboard on it and it's a flat lamb a
round<00:03:31.430> lamb<00:03:31.640> will<00:03:31.880> be<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:32.090> little<00:03:32.390> bit<00:03:32.510> brighter

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
round lamb will be a little bit brighter

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.849 
round lamb will be a little bit brighter
so<00:03:33.890> now<00:03:34.100> here's<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.370> telling<00:03:34.730> neck<00:03:35.859> big

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
so now here's the telling neck big

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:46.840 
so now here's the telling neck big
u-shape<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.680> bird's-eye<00:03:46.459> strat

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
u-shape on it this is a bird's-eye strat

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.940 
u-shape on it this is a bird's-eye strat
neck<00:03:47.090> there's<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.870> telling<00:03:48.170> neck<00:03:48.319> more<00:03:48.590> mass<00:03:48.769> on

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
neck there's a telling neck more mass on

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.050 
neck there's a telling neck more mass on
this<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.489> going<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:49.670> be<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> little<00:03:49.940> bit

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
this so it's going to be a little bit

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.069 
this so it's going to be a little bit
more<00:03:50.209> higher<00:03:50.390> resonant<00:03:50.810> frequency<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:53.079> now

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
more higher resonant frequency so now

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.400 
more higher resonant frequency so now
what<00:03:54.609> this<00:03:55.609> is<00:03:55.819> what<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> deal<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.380> a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
what this is what the deal is is that a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.860 
what this is what the deal is is that a
lot<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.859> guitar<00:03:58.160> players<00:03:58.190> they<00:03:58.940> don't<00:03:58.970> aren't

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
lot of guitar players they don't aren't

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.330 
lot of guitar players they don't aren't
like<00:04:00.139> guitar<00:04:00.410> there's<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> lot<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.889> guitar

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
like guitar there's a lot of guitar

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.190 
like guitar there's a lot of guitar
manufacturers<00:04:01.970> they<00:04:02.180> don't<00:04:02.420> do<00:04:02.660> what<00:04:02.900> we<00:04:03.019> do

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
manufacturers they don't do what we do

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.740 
manufacturers they don't do what we do
and<00:04:03.519> I'm<00:04:04.519> not<00:04:04.549> sitting<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:05.209> waving<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
and I'm not sitting here waving the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.830 
and I'm not sitting here waving the
Fender<00:04:06.049> flag<00:04:06.350> on<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.620> but<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.630> thought

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
Fender flag on it but the thought

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.110 
Fender flag on it but the thought
process<00:04:09.470> in<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.010> guy's<00:04:10.220> in<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.549> custom<00:04:10.910> shop

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
process in the guy's in the custom shop

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.180 
process in the guy's in the custom shop
and<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.420> way<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.690> we<00:04:11.810> build<00:04:12.109> stuff<00:04:12.440> goes

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
and the way that we build stuff goes

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.390 
and the way that we build stuff goes
like<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:14.600> when<00:04:15.139> we<00:04:15.319> when<00:04:15.799> we<00:04:15.829> go<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.130> build

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
like that so when we when we go to build

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.229 
like that so when we when we go to build
a<00:04:16.519> guitar<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.299> or<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.850> example

have light wood we have medium wood we

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.290 
have light wood we have medium wood we
have<00:06:09.469> heavy<00:06:09.740> wood<00:06:10.010> you<00:06:10.250> know<00:06:10.400> whatever<00:06:11.090> you

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
have heavy wood you know whatever you

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.610 
have heavy wood you know whatever you
want<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.510> do<00:06:11.659> you<00:06:11.870> can<00:06:11.900> order<00:06:12.260> whatever<00:06:12.409> you

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
want to do you can order whatever you

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.610 
want to do you can order whatever you
want<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:13.750> it<00:06:14.750> just<00:06:14.780> takes<00:06:15.080> longer<00:06:15.409> to<00:06:15.500> go

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
want and it just takes longer to go

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.839 
want and it just takes longer to go
through<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:15.979> pick<00:06:16.099> out<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.280> real<00:06:16.490> light<00:06:16.669> piece

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
through and pick out a real light piece

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.190 
through and pick out a real light piece
of<00:06:17.000> wood<00:06:17.180> for<00:06:17.419> somebody<00:06:17.750> if<00:06:17.840> they<00:06:17.930> want<00:06:18.110> it

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
of wood for somebody if they want it

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.990 
of wood for somebody if they want it
that's<00:06:18.349> why<00:06:18.530> it<00:06:18.680> costs<00:06:18.890> more<00:06:19.219> because<00:06:19.789> if<00:06:19.909> we

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
that's why it costs more because if we

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.149 
that's why it costs more because if we
have<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.210> dig<00:06:20.450> through<00:06:20.659> a<00:06:20.780> pallet<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.680> lumber

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
have to dig through a pallet of lumber

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.920 
have to dig through a pallet of lumber
to<00:06:22.190> find<00:06:22.550> something<00:06:23.000> that's<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.719> specific

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
to find something that's a specific

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.600 
to find something that's a specific
weight<00:06:24.409> then<00:06:24.650> that's<00:06:25.039> going<00:06:25.159> to<00:06:25.219> take<00:06:25.400> time

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
weight then that's going to take time

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.810 
weight then that's going to take time
and<00:06:25.849> time<00:06:26.060> is<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:27.159> you<00:06:28.159> know<00:06:28.280> that's<00:06:28.580> kind<00:06:28.760> of

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
and time is and you know that's kind of

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.020 
and time is and you know that's kind of
how<00:06:28.969> it<00:06:29.120> works<00:06:29.330> down<00:06:29.930> here<00:06:29.960> and<00:06:30.320> and<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.940> know

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
how it works down here and and you know

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.370 
how it works down here and and you know
so<00:06:32.210> it's<00:06:32.330> just<00:06:32.419> I<00:06:32.539> think<00:06:32.630> it's<00:06:32.900> important<00:06:33.320> for

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
so it's just I think it's important for

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.080 
so it's just I think it's important for
you<00:06:33.590> to<00:06:33.620> understand<00:06:34.070> that<00:06:34.219> you<00:06:34.640> know<00:06:34.729> resonant

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
you to understand that you know resonant

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.610 
you to understand that you know resonant
frequency<00:06:35.539> everything<00:06:35.900> resonates<00:06:36.500> at<00:06:36.590> a

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
frequency everything resonates at a

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.909 
frequency everything resonates at a
certain<00:06:36.919> frequency<00:06:36.950> and<00:06:38.169> once<00:06:39.169> you<00:06:39.349> you<00:06:39.830> know

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
certain frequency and once you you know

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.379 
certain frequency and once you you know
put<00:06:40.099> two<00:06:40.280> of<00:06:40.370> these<00:06:40.460> things<00:06:40.700> together<00:06:40.849> now<00:06:41.330> you

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
put two of these things together now you

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:41.950 
put two of these things together now you
have<00:06:41.660> a<00:06:41.690> real

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
have a real

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.480 
have a real
whole<00:06:42.050> different<00:06:42.199> thing<00:06:42.560> and<00:06:42.800> you<00:06:43.130> just<00:06:43.310> kind

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
whole different thing and you just kind

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.830 
whole different thing and you just kind
of<00:06:43.520> need<00:06:43.759> to<00:06:43.789> find<00:06:44.090> out<00:06:44.240> what<00:06:44.389> works<00:06:44.600> for<00:06:44.690> you

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
of need to find out what works for you

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.080 
of need to find out what works for you
what<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.319> like<00:06:45.530> to<00:06:45.680> hear<00:06:45.949> lighter<00:06:46.639> guitars

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
what you like to hear lighter guitars

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.340 
what you like to hear lighter guitars

for some people they don't like them

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.600 
for some people they don't like them
because<00:06:48.470> their<00:06:48.740> study<00:06:49.009> and<00:06:49.220> they<00:06:49.280> don't<00:06:49.430> cut

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
because their study and they don't cut

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.710 
because their study and they don't cut
through<00:06:49.759> the<00:06:49.850> band<00:06:50.090> too<00:06:50.300> much

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
through the band too much

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.170 
through the band too much
I'm<00:06:50.930> good<00:06:51.440> medium<00:06:51.800> weight<00:06:51.979> guitar<00:06:52.460> will

I'm good medium weight guitar will
really<00:06:53.509> you<00:06:53.810> know<00:06:53.930> cut<00:06:54.139> through<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:54.380> band

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
really you know cut through the band

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.469 
really you know cut through the band
more<00:06:54.860> has<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.220> little<00:06:55.460> bit<00:06:55.520> more<00:06:55.580> sustain<00:06:56.090> to<00:06:56.330> it

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
more has a little bit more sustain to it

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.029 
more has a little bit more sustain to it
acoustically<00:06:57.470> it<00:06:57.560> sounds<00:06:57.860> a<00:06:57.919> little

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
acoustically it sounds a little

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.999
