the inside of the aquatic ideas we want

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.850 
the inside of the aquatic ideas we want
to<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> light<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.810> can<00:04:51.990> silent<00:04:52.530> well<00:04:52.710> it

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
to a light that we can silent well it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.800 
to a light that we can silent well it
depends<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:53.400> for<00:04:53.669> example<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.060> have<00:04:54.509> a<00:04:54.539> blue

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
depends on for example you have a blue

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
face you can buy the glue rocks from the

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.900 
face you can buy the glue rocks from the
aquarium<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:59.039> see<00:04:59.250> type<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.669> same
