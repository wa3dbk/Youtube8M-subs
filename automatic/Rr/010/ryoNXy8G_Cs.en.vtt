end for the team but an understandable

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.150 
end for the team but an understandable
one<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.630> know<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.080> look<00:03:16.320> at<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:17.010> amount

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
one you know if you look at the amount

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
one you know if you look at the amount
of<00:03:17.250> games<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:18.570> we're<00:03:18.720> trying<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.080> get<00:03:19.200> now

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
of games that we're trying to get now

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.020 
of games that we're trying to get now
but<00:03:19.650> more<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.250> training<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.700> we've<00:03:20.820> had

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
but more so the training that we've had

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300 
but more so the training that we've had
it's<00:03:21.750> been<00:03:21.840> very<00:03:22.140> very<00:03:22.320> hard<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.770> tiring<00:03:23.010> for

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
it's been very very hard and tiring for

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
it's been very very hard and tiring for
the<00:03:23.370> place<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.720> first<00:03:24.930> 45

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the place so I think the first 45

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
the place so I think the first 45
minutes<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.830> okay<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.970> second<00:03:27.330> 45

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
minutes was okay and the second 45

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.100 
minutes was okay and the second 45
minutes<00:03:28.020> was<00:03:28.140> pretty<00:03:28.380> much<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:29.000> reason

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
minutes was pretty much a reason

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.450 
minutes was pretty much a reason
surrounding<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.260> we've<00:03:31.500> been<00:03:32.160> training

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
surrounding how we've been training

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.610 
surrounding how we've been training
twice<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> day<00:03:33.060> every<00:03:33.300> day<00:03:33.330> leading<00:03:34.170> into<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
twice a day every day leading into the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.400 
twice a day every day leading into the
game<00:03:35.000> look<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.120> think<00:03:36.210> we<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.750> first<00:03:37.050> thing<00:03:37.260> is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
game look I think we the first thing is

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.110 
game look I think we the first thing is
watching<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.160> game<00:03:38.190> today<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.850> need<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
watching the game today we need to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.760 
watching the game today we need to
improve<00:03:39.390> vastly<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.110> area<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.440> keeping

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
improve vastly in the area of keeping

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.360 
improve vastly in the area of keeping
possession

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
possession

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.160 
possession
you<00:03:41.490> know<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:41.790> lose<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> ball<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.750> many<00:03:42.900> times

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
you know we lose the ball so many times

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.220 
you know we lose the ball so many times
and<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.610> remember<00:03:44.970> now<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.780> writing<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.140> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
and I remember now just writing in the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.620 
and I remember now just writing in the
notes<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.820> too<00:03:47.820> many<00:03:47.970> times<00:03:48.210> we<00:03:48.330> keep<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
notes that too many times we keep the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.990 
notes that too many times we keep the
ball<00:03:48.780> long<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.250> something<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.820> we

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
ball long it's not something that we

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.630 
ball long it's not something that we
plan<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.810> training<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.310> something<00:03:53.610> that

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
plan a training it's just something that

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.160 
plan a training it's just something that
happens<00:03:54.030> when<00:03:54.150> players<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> full

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
happens when players don't have a full

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.320 
happens when players don't have a full
understanding<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.890> game<00:03:56.010> plan<00:03:56.280> yet<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:57.270> I

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
understanding of the game plan yet so I

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.440 
understanding of the game plan yet so I
think<00:03:57.570> as<00:03:57.900> time<00:03:58.790> takes<00:03:59.790> effect<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.270> we<00:04:00.330> have

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
think as time takes effect and we have

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.820 
think as time takes effect and we have
the<00:04:00.540> opportunity<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.200> start<00:04:01.410> working<00:04:01.500> now

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
the opportunity to start working now

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.080 
the opportunity to start working now
with<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> players<00:04:02.370> technically<00:04:02.820> as<00:04:02.940> I've

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
with the players technically as I've

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.940 
with the players technically as I've
said<00:04:03.240> last<00:04:03.480> week<00:04:03.720> we'll<00:04:04.380> start<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.740> see<00:04:04.890> an

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
said last week we'll start to see an

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.250 
said last week we'll start to see an
improvement
