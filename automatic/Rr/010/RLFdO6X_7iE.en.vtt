00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.300
 To the taste I can tell you is 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.530
 a very very funny tobacco with a 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.380
 sweet but with a very sweet 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.920
 dominant tobacco reason taste and the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.620
 Seasoning together is a very good tobacco 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.380

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.560
 It's a pity that the tobacco is not so 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.350
