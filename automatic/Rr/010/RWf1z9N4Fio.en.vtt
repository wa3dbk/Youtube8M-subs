double-a but for me and the price of the
batteries<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:30.680> with<00:02:30.860> all<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
other flashlights and stuff that I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.680 
other flashlights and stuff that I
always<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.900> testing<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.350> review<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:34.690> like

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
always have in testing and review I like

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.870 
always have in testing and review I like
using<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.050> triple<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.500> or<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.430> double-a<00:02:37.850> I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
using the triple a or the double-a I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360 
using the triple a or the double-a I
mean<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:39.710> just<00:02:39.860> goes<00:02:40.070> with<00:02:40.190> more

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
mean because it just goes with more

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.770 
mean because it just goes with more
batteries<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.850> have<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.210> more<00:02:41.330> other

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
batteries that I have and more other

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320 
batteries that I have and more other
things<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.410> around<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.770> house<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
things that I have around the house and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.630 
things that I have around the house and
the<00:02:45.020> cost<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> battery<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.980> me<00:02:46.130> doesn't

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the cost of the battery to me doesn't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.660 
the cost of the battery to me doesn't
give<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.270> much<00:02:47.450> better<00:02:48.250> advantage<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.520> mean

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
give that much better advantage I mean

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.210 
give that much better advantage I mean
that<00:02:49.790> 10<00:02:50.000> lumens<00:02:50.210> between<00:02:50.690> 120<00:02:51.230> 130<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.920> just

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that 10 lumens between 120 130 you just

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.710 
that 10 lumens between 120 130 you just
almost<00:02:52.760> really<00:02:53.150> can't<00:02:53.390> even<00:02:53.450> tell<00:02:53.690> a
