as a loggia

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
as a loggia
the<00:01:42.570> first<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.050> is<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:44.250> must<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.670> been

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the first one is it must have been

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.300 
the first one is it must have been
Kabuto<00:01:45.330> that<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:45.869> implemented<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.009> renege

Kabuto that has implemented the renege

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.149 
Kabuto that has implemented the renege
on<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.729> Medora<00:01:48.600> since<00:01:49.080> Cobb<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.680> said<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
on in Medora since Cobb also said that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
on in Medora since Cobb also said that
he<00:01:50.400> had<00:01:50.610> made<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.689> better<00:01:51.930> than<00:01:52.170> he

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
he had made but there are better than he

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920 
he had made but there are better than he
was<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.560> his<00:01:52.740> prime<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
was in his prime but this then again is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.190 
was in his prime but this then again is
disproven<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:56.270> Medora<00:01:57.270> himself<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.900> he<00:01:57.990> said

think<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.470> wrong<00:02:29.770> because<00:02:30.010> if<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.520> think

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
think that's wrong because if you think

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.380 
think that's wrong because if you think
about<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
about it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.840 
about it
Medora<00:02:32.080> during<00:02:32.320> his<00:02:32.500> prime<00:02:32.770> had<00:02:33.160> obviously

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
Medora during his prime had obviously

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.540 
Medora during his prime had obviously
mastered<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.960> three<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.890> those<00:02:36.010> shutting<00:02:36.400> on

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
mastered all three of those shutting on

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.610 
mastered all three of those shutting on
and<00:02:36.790> still<00:02:37.090> wasn't<00:02:37.270> able<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.870> activate<00:02:38.260> renege

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and still wasn't able to activate renege

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.310 
and still wasn't able to activate renege
on<00:02:38.770> because<00:02:39.220> he<00:02:39.520> said<00:02:39.760> he<00:02:39.970> had<00:02:40.000> done<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.870> before

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
on because he said he had done it before

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.710 
on because he said he had done it before
his<00:02:41.770> death<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.820> reason<00:02:43.240> why<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.360> bring

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
his death now the reason why I bring

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.860 
his death now the reason why I bring
that<00:02:43.870> up<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.260> because<00:02:45.000> last<00:02:46.000> week<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:46.510> Medora

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that up is because last week when Medora

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.170 
that up is because last week when Medora
was<00:02:47.140> revived<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.980> first<00:02:48.310> thing<00:02:48.520> he<00:02:48.670> said<00:02:48.940> was

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
was revived the first thing he said was

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.380 
was revived the first thing he said was
Nagato<00:02:50.050> must<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.620> grown<00:02:50.890> now<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.150> very

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
Nagato must have grown now this is very

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.420 
Nagato must have grown now this is very
important<00:02:53.020> because<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.770> order<00:02:54.130> for<00:02:54.310> my

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
important because in order for my

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.980 
important because in order for my
daughter<00:02:54.670> know<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.530> Madonna<00:02:57.280> gato<00:02:58.000> he

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
must have been alive in the recent

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.470 
must have been alive in the recent
generation<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.400> means<00:03:03.610> he<00:03:04.000> must<00:03:04.210> have<00:03:04.300> died

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
generation that means he must have died

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.920 
generation that means he must have died
very<00:03:04.540> recently<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:07.330> definitely<00:03:07.780> very

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
very recently that's definitely very

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.650 
very recently that's definitely very
important<00:03:08.530> because<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.340> let's<00:03:10.030> say<00:03:10.150> he<00:03:10.420> had

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
important because if let's say he had

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.560 
important because if let's say he had
died<00:03:11.080> very<00:03:11.380> recently<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.220> means<00:03:13.030> he<00:03:13.270> just

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
died very recently that means he just

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.140 
died very recently that means he just
activated<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> renege<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.800> very<00:03:15.520> recently

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
activated the renege on very recently

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.810 
activated the renege on very recently
which<00:03:16.690> therefore<00:03:16.960> this<00:03:17.500> proves<00:03:17.860> caught<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
which therefore this proves caught the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.300 
which therefore this proves caught the
Kabuto<00:03:19.300> theory<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.160> mastery<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
Kabuto theory and the mastery of the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.670 
Kabuto theory and the mastery of the
Sharingan<00:03:21.640> theory<00:03:22.270> now<00:03:22.720> personally<00:03:23.050> what<00:03:23.470> I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
Sharingan theory now personally what I

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.160 
Sharingan theory now personally what I
think<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.880> be<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.090> way<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.510> activate<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
think can be the way to activate the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.570 
think can be the way to activate the
renege<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.850> need<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:29.220> OC<00:03:30.220> huh

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
renege on is you need to be OC huh

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.330 
renege on is you need to be OC huh
who<00:03:30.760> has<00:03:30.940> activated<00:03:31.540> obviously<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.890> perfect

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
who has activated obviously the perfect

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.020 
who has activated obviously the perfect
mangekyo<00:03:33.700> sharingan<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.630> has<00:03:35.380> also<00:03:35.800> has<00:03:36.700> had

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
mangekyo sharingan and has also has had

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.320 
mangekyo sharingan and has also has had
the<00:03:37.209> cells<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.920> Senju<00:03:39.280> clan<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
the cells of the Senju clan and the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.480 
the cells of the Senju clan and the
reason<00:03:40.660> why<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.810> say<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:41.650> well<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
reason why I say that is because well it

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.060 
reason why I say that is because well it
kind<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.820> makes<00:03:43.000> sense<00:03:43.209> because<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.830> said

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
kind of makes sense because it is said

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.650 
kind of makes sense because it is said
that<00:03:45.100> Medora<00:03:45.580> had<00:03:45.790> collected<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.510> DNA

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
that Medora had collected the DNA

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.440 
that Medora had collected the DNA
samples<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.650> hosh<00:03:47.980> Adama<00:03:48.340> during<00:03:49.120> their<00:03:49.240> fight

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
samples of hosh Adama during their fight

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.930 
samples of hosh Adama during their fight
and<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.530> order<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.800> do<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.610> makes<00:03:51.760> no

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and in order to do that it makes no

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.000 
and in order to do that it makes no
sense<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.510> randomly<00:03:52.900> collect<00:03:53.590> DNA

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
sense to just randomly collect DNA

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.910 
sense to just randomly collect DNA
samples<00:03:54.220> from<00:03:54.970> another<00:03:55.480> person<00:03:56.110> unless<00:03:56.739> you

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
samples from another person unless you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.470 
samples from another person unless you
want<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:57.310> something<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.390> think

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
want to do something with it and I think

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.840 
want to do something with it and I think
that<00:03:58.780> was<00:03:59.140> madara's<00:03:59.560> intentions<00:04:00.280> all<00:04:00.489> along

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
that was madara's intentions all along

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.449 
that was madara's intentions all along
another<00:04:01.660> reason<00:04:02.140> why<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.920> theory

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
another reason why that this theory

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.430 
another reason why that this theory
makes<00:04:03.700> sense<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.090> because<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.290> to

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
makes sense is because you have to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.949 
makes sense is because you have to
remember<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:06.100> original<00:04:06.489> sage<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.030> six<00:04:07.330> paths

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
remember the original sage of six paths

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.430 
remember the original sage of six paths
are<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:09.160> first<00:04:09.459> ninja<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.930> Nara<00:04:11.230> two

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
are the first ninja in the Nara two

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
are the first ninja in the Nara two
universe<00:04:11.920> was<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.820> man<00:04:13.060> who<00:04:13.330> had<00:04:13.510> two<00:04:13.810> sons

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
universe was the man who had two sons

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.800 
universe was the man who had two sons
now<00:04:14.739> his<00:04:14.920> two<00:04:15.130> sons<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.880> ancestors<00:04:16.390> of

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
now his two sons are the ancestors of

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.110 
now his two sons are the ancestors of
the<00:04:17.080> Uchiha<00:04:17.590> clan<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.400> Senju<00:04:18.700> clan

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
the Uchiha clan and the Senju clan

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.199 
the Uchiha clan and the Senju clan
therefore<00:04:20.020> meaning<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
therefore meaning the

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.350 
therefore meaning the
original<00:04:21.860> sage<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.889> six<00:04:23.039> paths<00:04:23.490> had<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
original sage of six paths had the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.930 
original sage of six paths had the
genetic<00:04:24.509> traits<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.100> shining<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.669> and

genetic traits for the shining on and
the<00:04:27.660> renege<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.080> therefore<00:04:29.009> meaning<00:04:29.580> the

the renege on therefore meaning the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.029 
the renege on therefore meaning the

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
powers to split in two because if you

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.180 
powers to split in two because if you
remember<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> whole<00:04:32.610> story<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.270> story<00:04:33.569> was

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
remember the whole story the story was

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.719 
remember the whole story the story was
one<00:04:35.190> son<00:04:35.520> had<00:04:35.940> his<00:04:36.419> eyes<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:38.099> other<00:04:38.340> son

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
one son had his eyes and the other son

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.559 
one son had his eyes and the other son
had<00:04:39.090> his<00:04:39.360> body<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.620> with<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.550> being<00:04:41.789> said<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
had his body so with that being said the

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.710 
had his body so with that being said the
eyes<00:04:42.780> were<00:04:43.110> obviously<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:44.180> ancestor<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.210> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
eyes were obviously the ancestor of the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.249 
eyes were obviously the ancestor of the
Uchiha<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.380> body<00:04:46.650> was<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.130> ancestor<00:04:47.880> of

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
Uchiha and the body was the ancestor of

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.290 
Uchiha and the body was the ancestor of
the<00:04:49.259> Senju<00:04:49.530> now<00:04:50.009> if<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.250> combine<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.880> two<00:04:50.910> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the Senju now if you combine the two you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.800 
the Senju now if you combine the two you
then<00:04:51.900> get<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.410> renege<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:52.919> once<00:04:53.610> again<00:04:53.940> now

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
then get to renege on once again now

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.600 
then get to renege on once again now
that's<00:04:55.139> what<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:55.560> personally<00:04:56.039> think<00:04:56.280> how<00:04:56.550> you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that's what I personally think how you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.379 
that's what I personally think how you
can<00:04:56.970> gain<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.690> renege<00:04:57.960> on<00:04:58.139> through<00:04:59.090> by<00:05:00.090> being

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
can gain the renege on through by being

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.600 
can gain the renege on through by being
og<00:05:00.750> huh<00:05:01.020> excuse<00:05:01.440> me<00:05:01.560> by<00:05:01.740> being<00:05:01.979> og<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.490> know

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
og huh excuse me by being og you know

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.029 
og huh excuse me by being og you know
but<00:05:03.300> then<00:05:03.599> again<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:04.050> time<00:05:04.259> paradox<00:05:04.590> wouldn't

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
but then again the time paradox wouldn't

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.499 
but then again the time paradox wouldn't
make<00:05:05.160> sense<00:05:05.430> because<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.000> was<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.270> case

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
make sense because if that was the case

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.800 
make sense because if that was the case
Madara<00:05:07.259> would<00:05:07.949> have<00:05:08.070> done<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.789> whole<00:05:09.000> you

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
Madara would have done the whole you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.830 
Madara would have done the whole you
know<00:05:09.979> implement<00:05:10.979> Haji<00:05:11.729> Thomas<00:05:12.150> Andrews<00:05:12.449> DNA

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
know implement Haji Thomas Andrews DNA

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.779 
know implement Haji Thomas Andrews DNA
in<00:05:12.930> his<00:05:13.020> body<00:05:13.259> a<00:05:13.440> long<00:05:13.620> time<00:05:13.919> ago<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:14.639> that's

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
in his body a long time ago but that's

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.460 
in his body a long time ago but that's
definitely<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.419> theory<00:05:15.659> that<00:05:15.750> makes<00:05:16.229> more

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
definitely the theory that makes more

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.510 
definitely the theory that makes more
sense<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.889> me<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:18.300> um<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.440> mean<00:05:19.650> Naruto

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
sense to me but um that I mean Naruto

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.820 
sense to me but um that I mean Naruto
