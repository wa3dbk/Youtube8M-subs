started<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.260> they<00:00:52.260> wouldn't<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.770> they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
started and they wouldn't that they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.760 
started and they wouldn't that they
would<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.129> started<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.789> trailer<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770

know<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> bank<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know there's going to be a bank and I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
know there's going to be a bank and I
arise<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.130> store<00:01:53.399> points<00:01:53.909> again

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
arise and so we can store points again

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
arise and so we can store points again
which<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.259> amazing<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.040> we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
which is going to be amazing so all we

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
which is going to be amazing so all we
need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.579> walk<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.920> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
need to do is walk out for it and you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
need to do is walk out for it and you
know<00:01:58.950> I've<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.790> no<00:02:00.060> idea<00:02:00.450> where<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
know I've got really no idea where it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929 
know I've got really no idea where it
could<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.560> only<00:02:01.860> possible<00:02:02.399> idea<00:02:02.700> could<00:02:02.880> be

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
could be the only possible idea could be

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
could be the only possible idea could be
would<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:04.079> underneath<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.310> spawn

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
would be probably underneath the spawn

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.850 
would be probably underneath the spawn
room<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> mall<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.590> maybe

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
room in the mall and you know maybe

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
room in the mall and you know maybe
somewhere<00:02:08.399> around<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.539> where

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
somewhere around because that's where

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
somewhere around because that's where
the<00:02:09.750> navcard<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.739> located<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the navcard was actually located so you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.160 
the navcard was actually located so you
know<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> couldn't<00:02:12.690> actually<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
know you couldn't actually see the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.820 
know you couldn't actually see the
navcard<00:02:13.560> was

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
navcard was

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740 
navcard was
until<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.220> went<00:02:14.340> over<00:02:14.610> by<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> said<00:02:15.480> no

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
until you went over by it and it said no

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.980 
until you went over by it and it said no
pres<00:02:15.990> X<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.560> pick<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.180> actual<00:02:18.480> nav<00:02:18.750> card

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
pres X to pick up the actual nav card

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.900 
pres X to pick up the actual nav card
itself<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.680> i'm<00:02:19.950> guessing<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.610> must<00:02:20.760> be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
itself so i'm guessing there must be

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.460 
itself so i'm guessing there must be
some<00:02:21.120> were<00:02:21.270> secret<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.050> we're<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.290> getting

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
some were secret that we're not getting

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.640 
some were secret that we're not getting
to<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.920> actually<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.060> deposit<00:02:24.390> point<00:02:24.840> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
to that actually we can deposit point so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
to that actually we can deposit point so
