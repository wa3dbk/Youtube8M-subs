00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
right turn on now this modification is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
right turn on now this modification is
pretty<00:02:03.539> cool<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> eliminates<00:02:05.129> the<00:02:05.280> need

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
pretty cool is it it eliminates the need

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.359 
pretty cool is it it eliminates the need
for<00:02:05.459> category<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.689> let's<00:02:07.049> say<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.289> can<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
for category so let's say you can have a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
for category so let's say you can have a
one<00:02:08.579> page<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.329> limited<00:02:10.019> amount<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
one page you have a limited amount of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
one page you have a limited amount of
icons<00:02:11.420> application<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:13.049> page<00:02:13.230> should<00:02:13.379> be

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
icons application so one page should be

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.819 
icons application so one page should be
games<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.750> basically<00:02:16.459> utilities<00:02:18.530> fun<00:02:19.530> stuff

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
games and basically utilities fun stuff

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.460 
games and basically utilities fun stuff
you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:21.959> spring

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you know all that and you have spring

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.130 
you know all that and you have spring
jumps<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.459> that'd<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.760> cool<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:24.930> get

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
jumps so that'd be cool and you can get

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.449 
jumps so that'd be cool and you can get
this<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.410> Cydia<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.160> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.339 
this from Cydia for a little bit of
money<00:02:26.519> or<00:02:27.390> i<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.750> free<00:02:27.810> someplace
