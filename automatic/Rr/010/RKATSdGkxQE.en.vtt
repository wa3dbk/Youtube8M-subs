00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to a hundred special already 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.500
 again from tile weather in 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.500
 cooperation with unpaid 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.010
 probably even stronger than us 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 had expected yesterday 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 So the submission is from today 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 evening at 18 o'clock and all night 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 through persist 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 we expect so in the area in the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.119
 southern Baden-W端rttemberg and in the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.450
 southern bavaria with the strongest 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 thunderstorms and stormy ones 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.540
 rain fell the line obendr端ber 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 only indicates where about also 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 Thunderstorms can and will occur 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.200
 but here in this area will be the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 worst the worst off go yes 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.890
 so it's not just with thunderstorms and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 to count rain but partly also 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.350
 with heavy rain before everything also with 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.780
 large hail partly in the southwestern 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.789
 Baden w端rttemberg and it does too 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 heavy gusts of wind to be expected 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.170
 also in southern bavaria is with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.460
 gale-force and gale-force gusts to be expected 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 in front of some alps and in the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 alpine foreland and yes in the south 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 Baden-W端rttemberg in the tri-border region 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 switzerland germany france need 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 We particularly careful because there would be 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 the winter from a great height 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 according to some models right dollar 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.790
 downward 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.060
 transported so with so-called down 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.220
 that means that the winds are like 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.730
 said one come down to the ground 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.000

 winds orkan wind gusts yes and partially 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.120
