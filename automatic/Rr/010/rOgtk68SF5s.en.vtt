00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
we're going to do computer craft

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.650 
we're going to do computer craft
tutorials<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:26.310> Friday<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:27.119> Luke<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
tutorials and on Friday we have Luke and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.880 
tutorials and on Friday we have Luke and
Mattias<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:30.260> that's<00:00:31.260> still

Mattias and they are that's still
surprised<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.180> yes

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
surprised what they are going to do yes

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.590 
surprised what they are going to do yes
so<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:35.070> sure<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.280> list<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.030> don't<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.420> either

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so be sure to list we don't know either

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.790 
so be sure to list we don't know either
but<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.410> ok<00:00:38.870> ok<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:39.930> today<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but that's ok ok so today we're going to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
but that's ok ok so today we're going to
take<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> look<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.399> using<00:00:42.300> computers<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
take a look at using computers as a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.860 
take a look at using computers as a
daylight<00:00:43.860> sensor<00:00:45.320> yes<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.860> ok<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
daylight sensor yes that's right ok so

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
daylight sensor yes that's right ok so
you<00:00:48.870> already<00:00:49.050> saw<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.280> let's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you already saw what it did and let's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
you already saw what it did and let's
show<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.719> how<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.530> done<00:00:52.620> yes

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
show you how it's done yes

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
show you how it's done yes
so<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.629> nice

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so you can see we have on this nice

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.189 
so you can see we have on this nice
balcony<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.739> our<00:00:56.070> water<00:00:56.879> house<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.989> nice

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
balcony on our water house some nice

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.000 
balcony on our water house some nice
lights<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.690> ceiling<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.230> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
lights in the in the ceiling and some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.549 
lights in the in the ceiling and some
nice<00:01:02.219> lights<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> water<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.390> there

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
nice lights in the water right there

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.640 
nice lights in the water right there
these<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> letters<00:01:05.090> upstairs<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
these are the letters upstairs we have

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
these are the letters upstairs we have
our<00:01:07.650> computer<00:01:08.189> system<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.970> it's<00:01:11.970> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
our computer system and it's actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.679 
our computer system and it's actually
pretty<00:01:13.110> simple<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.090> computer<00:01:15.360> right

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
pretty simple it's just a computer right

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.460 
pretty simple it's just a computer right
here<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:17.000> some<00:01:18.000> redstone<00:01:18.270> wire<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:19.080> over

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
here and some redstone wire going over

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.730 
here and some redstone wire going over
these<00:01:19.650> lights<00:01:20.040> activating<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.590> when<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
these lights activating them when the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
these lights activating them when the
redstone<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> activated<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
redstone is activated and this is a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.450 
redstone is activated and this is a
wireless<00:01:26.009> redstone<00:01:27.500> transmitter<00:01:28.500> which

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
wireless redstone transmitter which

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.969 
wireless redstone transmitter which
sends<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> signal<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:32.240> redstone<00:01:33.240> receiver

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
sends the signal to a redstone receiver

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
sends the signal to a redstone receiver
in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> water<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> can't<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.630> here

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
in the water and I can't see from here

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.649 
in the water and I can't see from here
but<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.590> ok<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.220> sent<00:01:38.909> yeah<00:01:39.150> basically

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
but that's ok it's sent yeah basically

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.789 
but that's ok it's sent yeah basically
it<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.110> sent<00:01:40.799> retina<00:01:41.549> redstone<00:01:42.119> signal<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it just sent retina redstone signal to a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
it just sent retina redstone signal to a
receiver<00:01:43.979> which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> where<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.930> want

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
receiver which is set up where you want

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.999 
receiver which is set up where you want
it<00:01:46.290> exactly<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:48.000> actually<00:01:48.649> takes<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> way

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it exactly so it actually takes the way

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.840 
it exactly so it actually takes the way
they're<00:01:50.340> sort<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.720> making<00:01:51.720> gigantic<00:01:52.850> redstone

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they're sort of making gigantic redstone

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.740 
they're sort of making gigantic redstone
wire<00:01:54.060> networks<00:01:54.950> yes<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.579> let's<00:01:56.880> take<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> look

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
wire networks yes so let's take a look

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.709 
wire networks yes so let's take a look
at<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> computer<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:59.119> we<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> program

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
at the computer here we have a program

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.160 
at the computer here we have a program
called<00:02:00.899> light<00:02:01.380> system<00:02:02.600> which<00:02:03.600> looks<00:02:04.079> like

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
called light system which looks like

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.600 
called light system which looks like
this<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:05.340> only<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.729> few<00:02:05.969> lines<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.450> code<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
this it's only a few lines of code and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.199 
this it's only a few lines of code and
this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.670> Lua<00:02:09.000> coding<00:02:09.479> by<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
this is Lua coding by the way and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.270 
this is Lua coding by the way and
we'll<00:02:12.749> put<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.109> code<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.650> description<00:02:14.129> as

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
we'll put the code in the description as

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.030 
we'll put the code in the description as
well<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.079> can<00:02:16.439> take<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> look<00:02:16.769> at<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
well so you can take a look at it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.179 
well so you can take a look at it
yourself<00:02:17.900> yeah<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.109> feel<00:02:19.379> free<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> pause<00:02:19.980> at

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
yourself yeah and feel free to pause at

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:20.690 
yourself yeah and feel free to pause at
any<00:02:20.340> minute

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.569 
yeah exactly
so<00:02:26.239> basically<00:02:27.239> we<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.900> while<00:02:28.409> true<00:02:29.010> do

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
so basically we have a while true do

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.449 
so basically we have a while true do
loop<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.359> which<00:02:31.170> means<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.889> program

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
loop here which means that the program

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.429 
loop here which means that the program
will<00:02:32.639> repeat<00:02:33.329> itself<00:02:33.590> constantly<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:37.170> any

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
will repeat itself constantly so at any

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.550 
will repeat itself constantly so at any
time<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.950> will<00:02:38.129> take<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.340> look<00:02:38.579> at<00:02:38.669> the<00:02:39.290> time<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
time it will take a look at the time and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.119 
time it will take a look at the time and
see<00:02:40.739> if<00:02:40.829> there's<00:02:41.069> any<00:02:41.340> daylight<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:43.129> act

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
see if there's any daylight and then act

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.270 
see if there's any daylight and then act
on<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:46.109> have<00:02:46.260> an<00:02:46.469> if<00:02:46.650> statement<00:02:46.889> here

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
on that so we have an if statement here

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.530 
on that so we have an if statement here
if<00:02:47.459> oh<00:02:48.450> s<00:02:48.870> dot<00:02:49.590> time<00:02:50.010> which<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> current

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
if oh s dot time which is the current

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.399 
if oh s dot time which is the current
time<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.530> 24<00:02:53.069> hour<00:02:53.219> system<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.409> that's

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
time in a 24 hour system if that's

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.740 
time in a 24 hour system if that's
bigger<00:02:55.739> than<00:02:56.069> eighteen<00:02:56.730> point<00:02:57.000> five<00:02:57.329> or

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
bigger than eighteen point five or

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.899 
bigger than eighteen point five or
smaller<00:02:58.680> than<00:02:59.659> five<00:03:00.659> then<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:02.370> lights<00:03:02.699> will

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
smaller than five then the lights will

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.619 
smaller than five then the lights will
go<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.959> that's<00:03:04.290> during<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.189> night<00:03:05.400> yeah<00:03:06.359> so

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
go on so that's during the night yeah so

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.009 
go on so that's during the night yeah so
eighteen<00:03:07.079> point<00:03:07.379> five<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.889> this<00:03:08.189> case<00:03:08.489> is

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
eighteen point five in this case is

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.530 
eighteen point five in this case is
thirty<00:03:10.019> past<00:03:10.379> six<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.609> evening<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.090> five

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
thirty past six in the evening and five

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.170 
thirty past six in the evening and five
is<00:03:12.840> five<00:03:13.769> o'clock<00:03:13.949> in<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.310> morning<00:03:14.669> exactly

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
is five o'clock in the morning exactly

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.259 
is five o'clock in the morning exactly
so<00:03:15.870> then<00:03:16.229> during<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.310> night<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.639> will<00:03:17.849> send<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
so then during the night it will send a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.219 
so then during the night it will send a
redstone<00:03:18.810> signal<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.189> right<00:03:20.459> output<00:03:21.229> and

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
redstone signal to the right output and

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.999 
redstone signal to the right output and
that's<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.769> true<00:03:23.040> signal<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.699> if<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.620> time

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
that's a true signal and if that time

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.300 
that's a true signal and if that time
statement<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.699> not<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> case<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:27.870> else<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
statement is not the case so else it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.610 
statement is not the case so else it
will<00:03:29.759> not<00:03:30.030> send<00:03:30.569> out<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> signal<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
will not send out the signal so the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.059 
will not send out the signal so the
lights<00:03:31.829> will<00:03:32.009> go<00:03:32.129> off<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:33.439> then<00:03:34.439> finally<00:03:34.859> this

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
lights will go off and then finally this

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.960 
lights will go off and then finally this
sleep<00:03:35.879> thing<00:03:36.329> here<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.500> make<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
sleep thing here it will make the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.429 
sleep thing here it will make the
program<00:03:39.239> wait<00:03:39.720> five<00:03:40.079> seconds<00:03:40.620> every<00:03:40.919> time<00:03:41.419> so

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
program wait five seconds every time so

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.409 
program wait five seconds every time so
it's<00:03:43.439> not<00:03:43.620> constantly<00:03:44.310> checking<00:03:44.879> the<00:03:45.150> time

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
it's not constantly checking the time

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.939 
it's not constantly checking the time
but<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:47.129> takes<00:03:47.459> five<00:03:47.759> second<00:03:48.180> breaks<00:03:48.509> so<00:03:49.409> it's

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
but it takes five second breaks so it's

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.089 
but it takes five second breaks so it's
not<00:03:50.129> constantly<00:03:51.030> calculating<00:03:51.269> no<00:03:52.259> cuz<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.949> it

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
not constantly calculating no cuz if it

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.330 
not constantly calculating no cuz if it
is<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.879> will<00:03:54.120> really<00:03:55.109> lag<00:03:55.469> your<00:03:55.680> server<00:03:55.949> or

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
is it will really lag your server or

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.819 
is it will really lag your server or
your<00:03:56.669> minecraft<00:03:57.449> yeah<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.590> sleep

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
your minecraft yeah so the sleep

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.459 
your minecraft yeah so the sleep
function<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.459> really<00:03:59.699> recommended<00:04:00.419> here<00:04:00.599> you

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
function is really recommended here you

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.129 
function is really recommended here you
could<00:04:01.650> actually<00:04:01.829> set<00:04:02.189> it<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> higher<00:04:02.729> or<00:04:03.139> or

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
could actually set it to a higher or or

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.949 
could actually set it to a higher or or
lower<00:04:04.530> value<00:04:05.009> if<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.280> want<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:05.790> five<00:04:06.540> it

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
lower value if you want but five it

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.969 
lower value if you want but five it
works<00:04:07.349> fine<00:04:08.000> sure<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.629> you<00:04:10.409> can<00:04:10.590> run<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
works fine sure so you can run the

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:16.180 
works fine sure so you can run the
program<00:04:11.129> simply<00:04:11.879> by<00:04:12.000> using<00:04:12.449> light<00:04:13.319> system<00:04:13.769> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.740 

right<00:04:17.190> now<00:04:17.370> it's<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:17.820> daylight<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
right now it's it's daylight so the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.250 
right now it's it's daylight so the
lights<00:04:18.930> are<00:04:19.079> off<00:04:19.229> but<00:04:20.840> let's<00:04:21.840> go<00:04:22.049> downstairs

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
lights are off but let's go downstairs

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.050 
lights are off but let's go downstairs
and<00:04:22.560> take<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.830> look<00:04:23.010> at<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.219> again

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
and take a look at it again

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.660 
and take a look at it again
so<00:04:24.630> as<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.960> can<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.680> Sun<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.100> setting<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
so as you can see the Sun is setting and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.390 
so as you can see the Sun is setting and
it's<00:04:26.790> getting<00:04:27.120> dark<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:28.320> lights<00:04:28.560> should

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
it's getting dark and the lights should

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.730 
it's getting dark and the lights should
switch<00:04:29.820> on<00:04:30.030> automatically<00:04:30.780> again<00:04:31.020> ah<00:04:31.170> there

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
switch on automatically again ah there

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.379 
switch on automatically again ah there
we<00:04:31.860> go<00:04:32.240> perfect<00:04:33.240> timing<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.889> now<00:04:35.340> our<00:04:35.389> balcony

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
we go perfect timing so now our balcony

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.400 
we go perfect timing so now our balcony
is<00:04:36.630> beautiful<00:04:37.610> beautifully<00:04:38.610> lit<00:04:38.790> in<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:40.169> nice

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
is beautiful beautifully lit in a nice

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.790 
is beautiful beautifully lit in a nice
moody<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:42.300> not<00:04:42.600> very<00:04:42.900> brightest<00:04:44.419> light<00:04:45.800> now

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
moody not not very brightest light now

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.830 
moody not not very brightest light now
I'd<00:04:47.400> say<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.850> only<00:04:47.880> thing<00:04:48.270> missing<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.690> some

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
I'd say the only thing missing is some

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.320 
I'd say the only thing missing is some
fireworks<00:04:51.889> so<00:04:52.889> this<00:04:53.310> was<00:04:53.520> our<00:04:53.730> daylight

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
fireworks so this was our daylight

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.170 
fireworks so this was our daylight
sensor<00:04:54.810> using<00:04:55.320> computer<00:04:55.680> craft<00:04:55.919> we<00:04:56.910> hope<00:04:57.030> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
sensor using computer craft we hope you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.960 
sensor using computer craft we hope you
