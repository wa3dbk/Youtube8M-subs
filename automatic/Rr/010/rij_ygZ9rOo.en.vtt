00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.120
 What happened? 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 Car accident. Arm fracture, suspected internal injury, severe head injury ... 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.040
 Ok, you have to be quick, prepare me the arnica montana solution 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.020
 - What dilution? - One in a million. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 But are you sure? The injured person is serious 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.360
 - You're right, we need something stronger, let's make one out of 10 million. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 - What has arrived ...? - Bring the box of plant extracts, I'll try the flower therapy! 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.640
 Umh, the Chakra has weakened, we need some crystal ... 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.820
 purple sapphire, quartz and amethyst ... 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680
 I think you're right ... 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.640
 add aquamarine! 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.560
 ... right decision ... 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.380
 Ok, let's stabilize it, does anyone know what kind of car hit it? 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.000
 A blue Ford Mondeo doctor ... 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.720
 Well! Take a blue Ford Mondeo body piece, put it in the water .... 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.320
 ... dilute it, then shake it dilute it again and shake it ... ... dilute it more and shake it ... and put three drops under your tongue. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.440
 if he doesn't take care of it, I don't know what he can do. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 - Take a look at this hand ... - What's up ... 

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:58.716
 ... this poor boy has very little to live ... -Why? 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.680
 ... look at the life line ... 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.960
 ... it's very short ... !! 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.240
 Not even the horoscope tells him well ... Sagittarius ... 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.120
 ... get ready for a surprise, things are changing for you 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.860
 ... well, it will happen, unless ... 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.480
 Wait up! 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.440
 ...thing... 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.520
 ... we can try to extend the life line with a pen ... 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200
 - ... but if we exaggerate ... - Do you have a better idea? 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.360
 Let's see what happens ... 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 ...damn... 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 Moment of death 3 and 34 ... about ... 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.760
 ... difficult days true ...? 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.120
 - I can't stand it when I lose it ... - It happens ... 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.880
 ... I don't know, sometimes I think that a belladonna molecule or an unmeasurable amount of arsenic is not enough ... 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.920
 ... don't be stupid Simon ... 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.400
 ok ... you will kill those who have cancer, or heart disease ... 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.240
 ... or bronchitis, flu, chickenpox, measles ... 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.520
 ... but when you see someone coming with a vague sense of discomfort or a little stressed or who has more money than a brain ... 

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:07.923
 ...will you be there. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.760
 ... with a little water in one hand and a huge receipt in the other. 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160
 I think you're right ... 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.800
 - Come on, a drink? - I need it... 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.920
 Please, two homeopathic beers ... 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.760
 Wow! It's strong stuff ...
