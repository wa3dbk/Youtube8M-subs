opinion because my entire life it's kind

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.560

of<00:00:35.899> being<00:00:36.140> around<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.550> know<00:00:37.579> its

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
of being around and it's you know its

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.229 
of being around and it's you know its
beta<00:00:38.989> version<00:00:39.530> wasn't<00:00:40.309> created<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.910> well<00:00:41.210> I

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
beta version wasn't created and well I

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.910 
beta version wasn't created and well I
think<00:00:41.420> was<00:00:41.660> created<00:00:42.020> actually<00:00:42.170> before<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:42.680> was

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
think was created actually before I was

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.920 
think was created actually before I was
born<00:00:43.129> which<00:00:43.399> is<00:00:43.629> insane

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
born which is insane

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.010 
born which is insane
so<00:00:45.079> I<00:00:45.110> think<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.620> was<00:00:45.710> made<00:00:45.920> about<00:00:46.539> three<00:00:47.539> years

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
so I think it was made about three years

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.700 
so I think it was made about three years
yeah<00:00:48.949> it<00:00:49.280> was<00:00:49.399> released<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.820> arcades<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.710> 1991

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
yeah it was released in arcades in 1991

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.479 
yeah it was released in arcades in 1991
so<00:00:52.510> that's<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:53.629> arcades<00:00:54.079> pockets<00:00:54.800> arcades

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
so that's it arcades pockets arcades

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.660 
so that's it arcades pockets arcades
yeah<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.270> was<00:00:56.359> released<00:00:56.570> in<00:00:56.690> arcades<00:00:56.870> on<00:00:57.670> 1991

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
yeah it was released in arcades on 1991

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.069 
yeah it was released in arcades on 1991
