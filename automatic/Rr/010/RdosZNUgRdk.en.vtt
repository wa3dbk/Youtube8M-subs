well<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:00.299> gene<00:00:00.510> is<00:00:00.690> not<00:00:00.870> just<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.260> gene<00:00:01.469> anymore

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
well the gene is not just a gene anymore

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.919 
well the gene is not just a gene anymore
folks<00:00:02.159> it's<00:00:02.520> all<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:03.060> since<00:00:03.449> genes<00:00:03.750> and

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
and I noticed you that's what you call

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.979 
and I noticed you that's what you call
this<00:04:16.250> team<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.000> your<00:04:17.120> tags<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.720> then<00:04:17.840> you're

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
this team and your tags and then you're

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.199 
this team and your tags and then you're
labeling<00:04:18.380> it's<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.919> mid-rise<00:04:19.400> jeans<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:20.060> it

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
labeling it's a mid-rise jeans so it

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.120 
labeling it's a mid-rise jeans so it
hits<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.600> right<00:04:20.630> at<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> waistline<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.739> it's

hits you right at the waistline and it's

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.640 
hits you right at the waistline and it's
the<00:04:22.789> reason<00:04:23.300> it's<00:04:23.599> number<00:04:23.810> one<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.380> because

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
the reason it's number one is because

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.750 
the reason it's number one is because
it's<00:04:25.010> probably<00:04:25.220> one<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.669> most

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760
