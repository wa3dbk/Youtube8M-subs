his<00:04:18.660> reputation<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.470> Moyes<00:04:19.979> maybe

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
his reputation and that Moyes maybe

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.400 
his reputation and that Moyes maybe
should<00:04:20.789> have<00:04:20.820> been<00:04:21.090> given<00:04:21.359> more<00:04:21.570> credit<00:04:21.989> for

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
should have been given more credit for

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.840 
should have been given more credit for
working<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:22.860> what<00:04:23.039> he<00:04:23.130> had<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.520> trying<00:04:23.789> to
