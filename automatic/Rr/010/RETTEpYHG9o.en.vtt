00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.550
 vim 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.550
 ii 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.159
 but it's very complicated of aspiq and success so for patrick 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.120
 only a few days later with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350
 the little keyboard 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.170
 Yes 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.210
 what you want 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.220
 the pack 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.690
 foot suggestions to convey on pjanic m not very convenient 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.450
 very clearly we did not even think the context was a shame 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.800
 it's really not good at all 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.570
 good it's not possible 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.689
 per account if you transform like this and it's during this table to follow 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.720
 the utility 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.300
 you switch to 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.120
 these 11 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.450
 the euro 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 full wind so that's for sure I'm 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 the local club sunday 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.170
 the sum of money 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 on this site 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.690
 but percent all that is acquired that the net for me too 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.550
 it's still not terrible digital for the transfer he thought 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.340
 not at all written a hotel thesis that was not bearable 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.490
 gone with the keyboard is there for the shot before that is the type 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 a ski fall 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.700
 v 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.069
 then
