want to turn it on or leave it on I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.019 
want to turn it on or leave it on I
should<00:01:21.409> say<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.219> essentially<00:01:22.729> gives<00:01:22.819> you

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:23.029 
should say it essentially gives you

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:24.879 
should say it essentially gives you
three<00:01:23.209> hit<00:01:23.359> points<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.109> can<00:01:24.349> spend<00:01:24.649> three

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
three hit points so you can spend three

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.769 
three hit points so you can spend three
to<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.249> that<00:01:25.340> point<00:01:25.520> die<00:01:25.969> have<00:01:26.539> another

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:26.779 
to get to that point die have another

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.059 
to get to that point die have another
three<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.139> get<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.469> end<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.709> that's<00:01:27.829> cool

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
three to get to the end and that's cool

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.589 
three to get to the end and that's cool
but<00:01:28.579> people<00:01:28.819> are<00:01:28.999> you<00:01:29.209> know<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.359> less

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
but people are you know a less

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:30.909 
but people are you know a less
experienced<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.170> playing<00:01:30.409> or<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.619> want<00:01:30.889> a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:30.919 
experienced to playing or just want a

experienced to playing or just want a
little<00:01:31.039> easier<00:01:31.490> time<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> essentially<00:01:33.619> all<00:01:33.889> of

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:33.919 
little easier time so essentially all of

little easier time so essentially all of
the<00:01:34.159> levels<00:01:34.310> are<00:01:34.700> identical<00:01:35.380> with<00:01:36.380> the

the levels are identical with the

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
granny levels are all there to the

design<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.209> all<00:02:54.329> start<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> same<00:02:54.959> as

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
design but they all start the same as

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.920 
design but they all start the same as
they're<00:02:55.859> parallel<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.970> normal<00:02:57.269> world<00:02:57.419> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they're parallel in the normal world and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.009 
they're parallel in the normal world and
that's<00:02:58.109> kind<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.590> nice<00:02:58.769> kind<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.549> know

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
that's kind of a nice kind of you know

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.970 
that's kind of a nice kind of you know
setting<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.109> think<00:03:01.319> do<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.739> was<00:03:01.889> the

setting I think do you think I was the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.800 
setting I think do you think I was the
same<00:03:02.129> level<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.400> what's<00:03:03.209> different<00:03:03.389> what<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
same level but what's different what the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.179 
same level but what's different what the
ghosts<00:03:04.049> done<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.349> this<00:03:04.439> world<00:03:06.829> so<00:03:07.829> here<00:03:08.010> that

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
have to be very careful but the ghost

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.670 
have to be very careful but the ghost
shot<00:04:40.000> powerup<00:04:40.510> will<00:04:40.660> also<00:04:40.930> come<00:04:41.140> back<00:04:41.320> as<00:04:41.470> well

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
shot powerup will also come back as well

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.200 
shot powerup will also come back as well
so<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.280> know<00:04:42.520> you'll<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.000> kind<00:04:43.120> of

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
so you know you'll have this kind of

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.640 
so you know you'll have this kind of
loop<00:04:43.450> sometimes<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.290> might<00:04:44.440> find

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
loop sometimes that you might find

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.020 
loop sometimes that you might find
yourself<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.430> kind<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.760> get

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
yourself in that you kind of have to get

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.510 
yourself in that you kind of have to get
your<00:04:46.180> timing<00:04:46.570> right<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:47.620> pass<00:04:47.800> those<00:04:48.130> kinds<00:04:48.460> of

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
your timing right to pass those kinds of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.500 
your timing right to pass those kinds of
situations<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.310> small<00:04:51.580> thing<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:51.880> this

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
situations it's a small thing but this

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.630 
situations it's a small thing but this
situation<00:04:53.050> here<00:04:53.470> we<00:04:53.530> have<00:04:53.710> two<00:04:53.830> dark<00:04:54.070> not<00:04:54.490> get

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
situation here we have two dark not get

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.190 
situation here we have two dark not get
squished<00:04:54.910> it's<00:04:55.390> that's<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.930> first<00:04:56.140> time

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
squished it's that's the first time

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.750 
squished it's that's the first time
we've<00:04:56.350> added<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:57.100> particular<00:04:57.400> game

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
we've added it to this particular game

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340 
we've added it to this particular game
and<00:04:57.970> we<00:04:58.030> obviously<00:04:58.150> know<00:04:58.630> Mario<00:04:58.960> well<00:04:59.110> just

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
and we obviously know Mario well just

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.719 
and we obviously know Mario well just
like<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.650> has<00:05:00.070> done<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.370> kind<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.580> game

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
like that has done that kind of game

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.820 
like that has done that kind of game
played<00:05:00.940> for<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.240> long<00:05:01.270> time<00:05:01.630> but<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:02.320> those

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
played for a long time but it's those

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.350 
played for a long time but it's those
little<00:05:03.070> things<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.490> we<00:05:03.640> wanted<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.030> add<00:05:04.210> to

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
little things that we wanted to add to

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.810 
little things that we wanted to add to
this<00:05:04.479> game<00:05:04.720> where<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.740> in<00:05:06.040> this<00:05:06.370> game<00:05:06.610> because

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
this game where it in this game because

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.320 
this game where it in this game because
it's<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.090> simple<00:05:07.419> those<00:05:08.290> tiny<00:05:08.710> variations<00:05:09.330> in

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
it's so simple those tiny variations in

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.420 
it's so simple those tiny variations in
gameplay<00:05:10.680> make<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.710> big<00:05:11.919> difference<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:12.400> know

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
gameplay make a big difference you know

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.250 
gameplay make a big difference you know
to<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.760> player<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.630> decision<00:05:14.110> they<00:05:14.229> have

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
to the player it's a decision they have

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.060 
to the player it's a decision they have
to<00:05:14.440> make<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:15.610> avoid<00:05:15.820> getting<00:05:15.850> hurt<00:05:16.360> or<00:05:16.540> dying

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
to make to avoid getting hurt or dying

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.140 
to make to avoid getting hurt or dying
so<00:05:18.070> it's<00:05:18.220> nice<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.400> be<00:05:18.550> able<00:05:18.640> to<00:05:18.760> add<00:05:18.880> just

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
so it's nice to be able to add just

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.820 
so it's nice to be able to add just
these<00:05:19.330> little<00:05:19.510> touches<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:20.020> varieties<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.740> the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
these little touches of varieties to the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.559 
these little touches of varieties to the
players<00:05:21.130> just<00:05:21.310> entertain<00:05:21.700> more<00:05:21.880> essential

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
players just entertain more essential

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.610 
players just entertain more essential
so<00:05:23.569> it's<00:05:23.780> working<00:05:23.960> out<00:05:24.139> pretty<00:05:24.199> well<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.560> I

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
so it's working out pretty well and I

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.770 
so it's working out pretty well and I
think<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.220> changes<00:05:25.639> in<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:25.789> rules<00:05:26.000> you

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
think that the changes in the rules you

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.939 
think that the changes in the rules you
know<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:26.960> can't<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.319> can't<00:05:27.530> shoot<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.800> guys

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
know you can't you can't shoot the guys

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.499 
know you can't you can't shoot the guys
you<00:05:28.190> have<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.340> avoid<00:05:28.430> them<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:28.849> all<00:05:29.330> the

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
you have to avoid them and all the

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.180 
you have to avoid them and all the
moving<00:05:29.690> stuff<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.229> just<00:05:30.259> adds<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:30.979> know<00:05:31.069> it's

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
moving stuff it just adds you know it's

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.330
