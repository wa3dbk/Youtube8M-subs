00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.790
 the staff well and today I will teach how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 make a pistol use springs from one of hers 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.019
 It is likely that you have already seen some 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 toy for but not in the format 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 that I'm going to teach you is the toy that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 You have already seen several years of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 existence on the internet but does not know 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.170
 Sure, whoever created it, I can not let it go. 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.300
 he has since I do not know who 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 I was really I have been creating 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 This but I did not go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 is so I will not lie but faces 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 this part of the entrepreneur and I think 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.559
 with much better the project is since 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 was the entrepreneur and much easier 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 shoot and gun gets stronger like this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 on hand here 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.590
 so this gives to point best thing 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.530
 What you have to do is set up a 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 spring and will need to draw is in the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.570
 parts very quickly brings us 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.629
 for this pause and you design so 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 guarín to have this match you have 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.559
 be very careful and if they are 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.449
 children have to ask for help from an adult 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 sure it will not matter from us 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 to help 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.820
 initially take this rectangle out and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.189
 then make this channel to be more 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 easy you make a 90 degree cut or 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.740
 be a cut because of ldu and design 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.439
 then make a slanted cut to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.720
 intersect with 90 degree cuts and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.500
 so ready it 's easier to take 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.299
 to finish lincoln chavo just take out is 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.229
 in those works and this is everything else 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.299
 luizinho have to make the other party 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.720
 procedure on the part of the channel is 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.509
 ie make it cut 90 degrees one side 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 on the other side and then do 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.970
 five cuts inclined to accept the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.970
 90 degree cuts 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.380
 You gotta have love instead. 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.290
 these little bits 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.440
 You can see red here better until 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.540
 here and now leave one part in the other 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.660
 He has to make sure everything is okay. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.110
 made before the political party has to 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.060
 walk freely you are all right 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.920
 just to scratch one part to another I'm going to use 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.780
 a super glue but you can use 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.830
 against schools with the left either 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.900
 use glue to glue the wood glue that almost 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.570
 the same thing but at last can be 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.410
 faced from the front are are coke 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.660
 Really 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.420
 the important thing is that it does not overflow 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.780
 part of the internal channels can not be 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.489
 use in the adhesive to fit to the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.500
 entrepreneur you initially have to 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.920
 make this cut here that I won 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.380
 then he has correctly reported 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.209
 triangular and see the angle 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.820
 approximate to make the part of the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:04.090
 incubator have to join one for 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.940
 grind again here super glue has to 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.880
 do two parts with more here 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.150
 I've already done another here because it's clear 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.720
 part to another point glue only to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.720
 tanguá 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.650
 the former becomes too large if 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.799
 you leave yes 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.130
 you should cut is the size of 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.540
 be right for your mother to make and 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.250
 uses a metal saw with salazar era 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.320
 total and not use that for matter 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.690
 even though the cut is not so 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.570
 accurate since the teeth was normal 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.359
 are too large that you have to use a 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.660
 little of the glue fits much in the 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.660
 other 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.950
 to finish it just fit the one to 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.030
 I told you to switch to the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.630
 end of the weapon 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.860
 which is something that a difficult climate 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.530
 taking care of the springs that you 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.770
 use but this part here from Iran of 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.350
 my balls were pretty rubbish and 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.910
 Sunday you fit into one thing only 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.350
 If you're going to use this, you have to use 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.390
 goggles and has to be 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.040
 quite responsible because there are some 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:23.280
 Strength ok and does not point against me is equal 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.050
 protection can use the sun also right and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.419
 ready to shoot I see a pistol here 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:33.320
 normal that it was ready to close a 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:35.820
 kitten and that 's it 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.190
 I just hope the state if you want. 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.800
 to help the channel is just to leave a like and 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.300
 shall be entered if they are not 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.550
 Do you have any suggestion of the project? 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.210
 leave us comments that will later 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.169
 try to do as always did hit the i 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.169
 tomorrow
