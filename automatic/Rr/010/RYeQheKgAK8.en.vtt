00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.960
 hello everyone my name is bad reputation and 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.910
 Welcome to the second map of 3 versus 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.009
 3 d game but is that I was playing with 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.150
 rival it and if they remember the first map 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.249
 it was in shopping 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.079
 I will not say how much we won 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.539
 put the map video link 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.650
 previous in the description itself 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.330
 someone who did not see it I will not say 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.890
 as we left because maybe someone 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.900
 he did not see it he 's seeing this he did not see it 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.169
 and good to not take away the emotion more 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.669
 that nothing good basically wanted to talk 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.839
 of that and he's going to talk a little bit and then 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.660
 I will leave 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.710
 I do not have the voices recorded because I said 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the previous video that I was going to record 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.629
 the voices but this one already had it engraved 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.460
 for the next if I play another game 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.890
 valdÃ©s if I succeed in recording 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.740
 I'm going to try to record the voices that I think 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.530
 which is more fun 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.630
 and by the way this is this map I think 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.390
 if it becomes more funnier to see that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 the shopping because it worked out better in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.810
 Overall, I got a lot better 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.079
 I think it was better in this than in the 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.780
 other 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.250
 and I had a lot of fun in this to see a 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.990
 round in which they will see a play that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.360
 more pretty good with nasa 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.390
 I want to tell you my purpose in this 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.850
 game was they know that I lower to grenades 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.960
 not to pineapples on this map just something and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.270
 they go for the arch and if for the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 the arch is not going for the frank excuse and if I see 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110
 I 'm coming two for me in the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.320
 grenades what I do is go back 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.330
 and hold them a little while they 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.880
 two are charged to whoever is there in the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.560
 frank with them that basically the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.120
 strategy in general not after we went 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.770
 changing because you are appearing in 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.500
 different places when we think down 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.760
 since the round of the boom that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.650
 play a little bit different they're going to 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.090
 see now in the next round but it came out 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.070
 pretty good in general I think it's more 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.680
 fun to see this I think it's a 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.660
 little faster too and well that was 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 basically everything I'm going to stop talking 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.229
 here they concentrate more on the game and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.590
 not so much in my voice and in the nonsense 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.630
 what do I say 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.810
 and we'll see you in another video until 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.810
 then 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.579
 yes 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.140
 if we leave this victory 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.739
 we can stop until everyone is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.739
 dead 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.590
 come, come, come 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.590
 this ends 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 Y 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.600
 Clear 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 It has been impressive 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.670
 do not 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.540
 one outside 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.819
 Carlos is still young 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.480
 I have one 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.899
 that we carry 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.760
 do not 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.499
 of that victory the parents are 3 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.240
 do not 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.140
 very well
