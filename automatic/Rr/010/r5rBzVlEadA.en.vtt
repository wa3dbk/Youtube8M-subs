right<00:02:35.520> now<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> has<00:02:36.120> been<00:02:36.330> throughout<00:02:36.570> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
right now and has been throughout this

that<00:02:42.680> exhaust<00:02:43.370> system<00:02:43.790> sounds<00:02:44.090> great<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
that exhaust system sounds great and it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.020 
that exhaust system sounds great and it
provides<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> little<00:02:45.710> less<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:46.100> backflow

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.840 
provides for a little less of backflow
pressure<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.750> allows<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.860> have<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.580> little

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
pressure and allows you to have a little

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.390 
pressure and allows you to have a little

some homework you're well aware that the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.839 
some homework you're well aware that the
CNG<00:03:47.709> burns<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.879> lot<00:03:49.060> cleaner<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:51.069> motor<00:03:51.730> that

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
CNG burns a lot cleaner and a motor that

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.059 
CNG burns a lot cleaner and a motor that
runs<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.390> CNG<00:03:52.750> can<00:03:53.050> typically<00:03:53.379> last<00:03:53.709> quite<00:03:54.010> a

runs on CNG can typically last quite a

runs on CNG can typically last quite a
bit<00:03:54.250> longer<00:03:54.370> than<00:03:54.610> running<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.090> conventional
