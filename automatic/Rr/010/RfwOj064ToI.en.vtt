unique features here is that this is the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
unique features here is that this is the
first<00:00:23.039> camera<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.519> light<00:00:23.760> finder<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
first camera with light finder and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660 
first camera with light finder and
dynamic<00:00:25.619> caps<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.039> built<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> same

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
dynamic caps are built into the same

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.339 
dynamic caps are built into the same
camera<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.689> all-in-one

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
camera so now you have a all-in-one

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.769 
camera so now you have a all-in-one
solution<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.670> light<00:00:30.240> finder<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.660> wide

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
solution with light finder and wide

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
solution with light finder and wide
dynamic<00:00:30.929> range<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.560> challenging<00:00:31.980> lighting

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
dynamic range for challenging lighting

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.590 
dynamic range for challenging lighting
conditions<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.000> mean<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
conditions here I mean like really the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.940 
conditions here I mean like really the
best<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> both<00:00:33.960> worlds<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.680> shot

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
best of both worlds in one shot

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
best of both worlds in one shot
absolutely<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.760> configure<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
absolutely and you can configure that so

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
absolutely and you can configure that so
depending<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.290> whether<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.950> dark

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
depending on whether or not it's a dark

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
depending on whether or not it's a dark
lighting<00:00:38.670> condition<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> need<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> find<00:00:39.960> your

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
lighting condition you need to find your

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.500 
lighting condition you need to find your
technology<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.850> dynamic<00:00:41.850> range<00:00:42.059> scene<00:00:42.360> where

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you have wide dynamic range you can

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
you have wide dynamic range you can
configure<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.390> amazing<00:00:45.600> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
configure that it's really amazing it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.000 
configure that it's really amazing it's
impressive<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.260> what's<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> model<00:00:46.710> number

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
impressive but what's the model number

under<00:00:52.860> technology<00:00:53.370> cool<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.210> looks

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
under technology cool now this looks

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.090 
under technology cool now this looks
like<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> much<00:00:54.870> smaller<00:00:55.110> camera<00:00:55.590> obviously

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
like a much smaller camera obviously

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
like a much smaller camera obviously

home you're getting up there in age you
might<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.049> might<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.920> exactly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
might need one so I might know exactly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340 
might need one so I might know exactly
so<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> cheap<00:01:09.090> 12<00:01:09.360> series<00:01:09.600> where<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so this is a cheap 12 series where you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
so this is a cheap 12 series where you
actually<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.310> cam

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
actually have the cam

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.039 
actually have the cam
lens<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.540> comes<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> three<00:01:13.020> different

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
lens that comes in three different

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
lens that comes in three different
options<00:01:13.380> connected<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.670> processing<00:01:15.119> unit

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
options connected to the processing unit

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.830 
options connected to the processing unit
that<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.260> be<00:01:16.350> placed<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.010> know<00:01:17.130> outside<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
that can be placed you know outside of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.820 
that can be placed you know outside of
wherever<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> place<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.560> really

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
wherever you want to place it was really

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.499 
wherever you want to place it was really
designed<00:01:20.010> with<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> 20-foot<00:01:21.000> cable<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
designed with this 20-foot cable so it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.030 
designed with this 20-foot cable so it
really<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> covert<00:01:22.740> space

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
really can get in a covert space

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
really can get in a covert space
absolutely<00:01:23.729> i<00:01:23.759> mean<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
absolutely i mean this is this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.999 
absolutely i mean this is this is
clearly<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
clearly you know you could have this

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
clearly you know you could have this
behind<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> pin<00:01:26.729> hole<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> wall<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
behind the pin hole in a wall for a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
behind the pin hole in a wall for a
covert<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.229> patient<00:01:28.850> things<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.940> think<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
covert a patient things to think of that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.389 
covert a patient things to think of that
23<00:01:30.899> millimeters<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> lens<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
23 millimeters on the lens that time is

looks<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> new<00:01:45.210> video<00:01:45.420> encoder<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> we're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
looks like a new video encoder and we're

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
looks like a new video encoder and we're
video<00:01:46.470> encoder<00:01:46.800> since<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> Q<00:01:47.520> 7411<00:01:48.259> the

60 frames per second through advanced
team<00:01:56.369> crazy<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.300> mean<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.569> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> think
