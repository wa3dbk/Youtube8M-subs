00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.839
 OK 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.009
 Every day is 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.789
 It's a great change 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.319
 This rear suspension 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.130
 You should understand 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.700
 This white 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 Black kindness 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.660
 Roster performance and rupee labor and suspension 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.920
 It's just blowing it and changing it 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.060
 After all this 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.290
 It is just to say that synthesis 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.290
 Mr. Moriya changes quite large 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.850
 The motor journalist who started running started 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 I want to fix 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.590
 High school student 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.020
 Aluminum cut-out one-piece type rear suspension 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.900
 I 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.370
 Kobe City's adjustment type by injecting pairs 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 Room shooting Yayama from i-revo 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 But mountain beyond 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.930
 Accessory 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.460
 Awesome cool 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.190
 Can be resident 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.790
 here 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.020
 The United States also follows 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 Domestic invitation convention can be adjusted 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.870
 Portrait or suspension saying 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.160
 But I'm out 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.940
 Association that will present in the morning 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.000
 It looks like it's coming a little 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.180
 I have a Nakada wired board, but it does not vary by this 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.960
 you know 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.140
 In other words, instead of looseness, with a few adjustments 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 Very clear that the suspension adjustment can be done 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.500
 Can be designed 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.590
 High school student in one piece type 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.640
 It is very good to go into the hill rush and the weapon is also good 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.570
 And easily with this movie 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.879
 To adjust Kobe City 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.569
 Furthermore, it is hard to see a little bit 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.089
 But 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.089
 Now you can adjust the heel side 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.789
 Good thing 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.919
 Besides, I can not see this, but on this castle side 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:31.149
 In fact, the best suspension is a slump that is effective as a passenger 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.589
 frb and stabilizer will be attached 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.489
 26% of this 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.689
 This aluminum machined stabilizer at 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.680
 A sense of stiffness around the rear is further skipped by combining 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.959
 Can not 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.239
 Very running 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.769
 I know 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.749
 What's the point of it? After all, two points over the scooter my own 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:53.639
 It will be 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.789
 I also use it as a suspension of the stallion 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.009
 There is not a sense of relationship 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.469
 It seems like Yuyu Toshio 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.130
 At the end of the rough steel firmly in the traffic lights 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.289
 Credible 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:11.279
 And the adjustment range can be easily done by the successor of this house 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.959
 I can play sports 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.419
 Receive quantity 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.889
 You can ride well 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.749
 2 people died 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.579
 More than shaking 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.989
 High adjustment range is wide 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 It also seems to make you play 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.689
 At the same time 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.129
 Please think for a moment
