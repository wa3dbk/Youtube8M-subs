 Hello everyone, you gnawed today 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:20.369
 overview on 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 game wheel oklick in 2am racing wheel 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.960
 hank liquid yes and further to him 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.010
 gave here the steering wheel itself turns 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.290
 90 degrees of this well enough to 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 modern toys but for a simulator 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.890
 it will not be enough for the game 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.300
 for example dior 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:56.560
 Grid autosport for example 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:00.130
 new came out is also quite good complaining 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.250
 okay the wheel is so well what sigov on 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.600
 the rough surface of the sucker hero 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:12.609
 mounted on suckers of course sucks but 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.469
 basically ok suckers but if 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.539
 for example you have a glass table there or 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.509
 from granite 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.899
 it will even hold very well and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.079
 very tight okay and if you have there 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:29.189
 100 porous any air in there 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.049
 about the pusan pass particles 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.140
 as a result of this sucker 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.619
 sticks together in general if you have 100 damage 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 is there granite you or but glass although in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.240
 then good after smooth 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.480
 buttons here are various very convenient power 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 f1 2013 play or 2012 is very convenient 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:02.660

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.229
 petal switches and there are also 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:23.720
 usually box 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:23.720
 back and forth principle normal steering 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.420
 You can take it if you stumble on this 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.450

 color here is going to hell and vibration 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.550
 back recoil present vibration 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:50.459
 very convenient for example to play the euro track 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:54.019
 the simulator generally assigns buttons 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.120
 various switches 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.709
 play 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.640
 enough buttons here they are two more buttons 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.420
 it is to adjust the steering wheel well the steering sharpness 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.350
 general sensitivity 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:19.019
 here is this rubber coating this plastic 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.550
 and here it is here we have rubber in 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.550
 Basically pleasant to the touch 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:34.240
 Well, about the pedals now connects 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 here we are fucking like this 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:45.790
 that's connected with us, in principle, that's 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.209
 Here we have some kind of for the Internet 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.780

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.680
 the internet is 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:11.860
 in general, repent, well, everything is just like that 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.800

 Now that there is no brake is sticky 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.920
 just put on the floor and everything is well, not 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.790
