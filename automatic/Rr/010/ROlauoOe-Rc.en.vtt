depending on the file size the apps can
take<00:02:12.970> longer<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> quite<00:02:14.770> small<00:02:14.920> game

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
take longer this is a quite small game

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.140 
take longer this is a quite small game
so<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.490> shouldn't<00:02:15.640> say<00:02:15.760> too<00:02:15.820> long<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:19.030> be

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
so we shouldn't say too long this can be

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
so we shouldn't say too long this can be
quite<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.330> lengthy<00:02:19.660> process<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.470> know

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
quite a lengthy process but you know

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.640 
quite a lengthy process but you know
it's<00:02:21.570> if<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.690> really<00:02:22.930> want<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.170> game<00:02:23.320> not<00:02:23.530> bad

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it's if you really want the game not bad

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.770 
it's if you really want the game not bad
or<00:02:23.800> whatever<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.220> app<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.970> suppose<00:02:25.600> it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
or whatever the app then I suppose it's
