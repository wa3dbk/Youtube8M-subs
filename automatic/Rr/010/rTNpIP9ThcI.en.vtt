00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.770
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.420
 tuttoandroid.net we are here with one 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.040
 box that contains a device 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.219
 very interesting 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.600
 we are talking about htc one mini ie 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.430
 just arrived thanks to the office 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.210
 htc press so we're going to see 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.980
 the contents of the packaging that will be 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.529
 obviously that of the packaging of 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 sale however as you see the box is the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.329
 a simple scale then when it will come 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.340
 sold in stores will obviously 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.530
 however the content is different as already mentioned 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.420
 it's the one in the sales package 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:47.620
 so let's open the package 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 no we have ok together for the first time 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.070
 this is the device we see here more 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.510
 up close we obviously have 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.820
 wall power supply, let's go back for a moment 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:10.940
 to open the classic htc networks by now 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.940
 in black with the logo after we have here 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.549
 the paper clip to remove the microsim la 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.960
 we extract so we install the 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.960
 device with the micro sim 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.439
 then we have earphones 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.110
 a moment just ok 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.540
 they are very similar to those of htc one 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 then with the red black rubber pads with the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.460
 these cables too much crushed 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 aesthetically beautiful and with the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 remote control of course with mini di 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 replacement for the various pavilions 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.210
 different earphones and then we have the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.479
 micro usb usb cable this too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 completely black but let's take the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.330
 device 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.899
 we see this a little more closely 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.519
 here is the device as you see on the card 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.959
 there are a few features 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.380
 are the main features of the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.600
 series one ie htc binkley boom sound 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:26.130
 technology with sound and htc where we go 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 to open the card for the position 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.069
 so as you can see below there are the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.440
 sessions to install the micro sim 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.190
 this is the device here as you see 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.670
 aesthetically it is very, very similar to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.230
 htc one then aluminum on the back 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.780
 I'll see with aluminum inserts 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.609
 before this polycarbonate 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.010
 white that differs slightly from 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.760
 that of h that they go there and that these 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.370
 polished and we say these much more 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.530
 flashy we immediately do a 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.989
 dimensional comparison with his brother 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.299
 greater as you see the dimensions 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.799
 obviously they are minor for htc or mini 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.410
 but not so high we go 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:17.930
 a little to see what those are 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:21.060
 of the htc characteristics men a 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.440
 with regard to the above ports rate 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.480
 ignition, if anything, switching off which is not 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.810
 also infrared port 3 mm jack e 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.720
 half volume bar that like 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.940
 you see it's different than htc one 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.550
 micro usb port at the bottom 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.120
 with main microphone and here we have 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.850
 the drawer to extract the micro sim 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.940
 let's go immediately to insert the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.030
 our micro sim with the staple in 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.030
 equipment ok 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.409
 and we turn on the device in the meantime 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.950
 let's see if it turns ok 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.860
 meanwhile he talks to you a little 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.130
 technical features dimensions 132 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:20.250
 mm x 63 x 9 14 mm therefore enough 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.669
 slim at 122 grams 4.3 display 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.970
 inch super lcd with 1080 x resolution 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:31.830
 720 pixel processor is a qualcomm 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.590
 snapdragon 400 1.4gz dual core with 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.780
 16 gigabytes of internal memory a 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.690
 gigabyte of ram 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.900
 the cameras are front 1.6 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.380
 megapixel with video resolution up to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.120
 720p can seriously like that of htc 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.979
 when that is 4 megapixels with 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.560
 obviously ultra peak technology e 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.320
 video resolution up to 1080p 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.320
 the android version was 4.2.2 la 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.509
 battery instead of 1800 milian for like 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.699
 you see very very nice as materials 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.550
 just like htc one it just looks like a 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.539
 htc one in small size like 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.639
 we have seen for the hardware specifications 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.280
 this is very very different 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.159
 device we will test it thoroughly in 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.729
 these days if you have obviously 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.889
 Ask us questions 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.090
 within the youtube channel 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.610
 in this video how 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.099
 comment or obviously as a comment 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.870
 in the article on our blog 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.349
 obviously we will try as always of 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.590
 answer you within the review 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.050
 full 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.639
 where we will go to test more 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.690
 in depth this device which 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.060
 turns out to be really very interesting from 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.060
 emanuele capone is all true 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.060
