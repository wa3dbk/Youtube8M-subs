00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
everything is because a lot of times I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.750 
everything is because a lot of times I
have<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.959> ask<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.290> transporter<00:03:46.799> where<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.400> x-ray

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
have to ask a transporter where is x-ray

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.759
