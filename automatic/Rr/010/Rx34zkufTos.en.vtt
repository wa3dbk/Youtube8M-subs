here are the old intake alternator which
I'll<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.870> reusing<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> turbo

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I'll be reusing and this is the turbo

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
I'll be reusing and this is the turbo
400<00:00:55.140> that'll<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.890> reusing<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:56.910> I'm<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.090> go

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
400 that'll be reusing well I'm gonna go

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.590 
400 that'll be reusing well I'm gonna go
in<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.539> car<00:00:58.129> it's<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.850> car<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> ever<00:01:00.270> had

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
in this car it's my first car I ever had

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
in this car it's my first car I ever had
it's<00:01:00.780> an<00:01:00.870> 89<00:01:01.230> Camaro<00:01:01.680> looks<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> pile<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it's an 89 Camaro looks like a pile of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.830 
it's an 89 Camaro looks like a pile of
junk<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:04.830> runs<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
junk right now but it actually runs and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.010 
junk right now but it actually runs and
drives

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
drives

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
drives
so<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.070> nice<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.430> cars<00:01:08.580> only<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
so the nice little cars only got a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
so the nice little cars only got a
little<00:01:09.030> six<00:01:09.299> cylinder<00:01:09.570> area<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.229> thought

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
little six cylinder area so I thought

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
little six cylinder area so I thought
she<00:01:10.860> deserved<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.430> better<00:01:11.610> take<00:01:12.390> her

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
she deserved a little better take her

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990 
she deserved a little better take her
back<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.930> heydays<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> big<00:01:13.740> blocks<00:01:14.000> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
back to the heydays of the big blocks so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
back to the heydays of the big blocks so
this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> what's<00:01:15.360> sitting<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
this is what's sitting here now this is

it's<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.500> called<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> tarantula

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's what they called the tarantula

it's what they called the tarantula
actually<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> carburetor<00:01:51.390> sits<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> little

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
actually the carburetor sits a little

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
actually the carburetor sits a little
sideways<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.090> no<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
sideways on there as you can see no but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
sideways on there as you can see no but
that<00:01:54.360> allows<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:54.840> direct<00:01:55.079> airflow<00:01:55.229> into
