falls off just ridiculous and he kills
himself<00:03:55.590> right<00:03:55.980> here<00:03:56.160> he<00:03:56.250> couldn't<00:03:56.520> believe

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
what just happened on the round ends but

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.940 
what just happened on the round ends but
uh<00:03:59.600> yeah<00:04:00.600> he's<00:04:00.750> using<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:00.990> orbital<00:04:01.410> vsat<00:04:01.590> this

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
uh yeah he's using the orbital vsat this

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.410 
uh yeah he's using the orbital vsat this
gameplay<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.340> actually<00:04:02.670> really<00:04:03.060> really

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
gameplay is actually really really

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.760 
gameplay is actually really really
really<00:04:03.750> old<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:06.290> back<00:04:07.290> when<00:04:07.500> people

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
really old and it's back when people

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.680 
really old and it's back when people
were<00:04:07.860> using<00:04:07.980> V<00:04:08.310> SATs<00:04:08.580> instead<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.090> load<00:04:09.330> stars

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
were using V SATs instead of load stars

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.010 
were using V SATs instead of load stars
or<00:04:10.050> escort<00:04:10.890> drones<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.660> he's<00:04:12.660> using<00:04:12.990> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
or escort drones and he's using the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.990 
or escort drones and he's using the
lodestar<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.800> mean<00:04:14.220> upload<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:14.670> he's<00:04:14.790> using<00:04:14.970> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
lodestar I mean upload so he's using the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.820 
lodestar I mean upload so he's using the
orbital<00:04:15.420> v<00:04:15.540> set<00:04:15.840> because<00:04:16.380> he's<00:04:16.680> actually

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
orbital v set because he's actually

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.060 
orbital v set because he's actually
playing<00:04:17.100> solo<00:04:17.489> solo<00:04:18.060> gameplay<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:19.230> I<00:04:19.680> guess

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
playing solo solo gameplay so I guess

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.130 
playing solo solo gameplay so I guess
the<00:04:20.310> orbital<00:04:20.640> vsat<00:04:20.790> was<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> lot<00:04:21.420> better<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:22.049> a

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
the orbital vsat was a lot better of a

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.110 
the orbital vsat was a lot better of a
choice<00:04:22.440> back<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:22.860> before<00:04:23.220> people<00:04:23.640> even<00:04:23.760> ran

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
choice back then before people even ran

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.340 
choice back then before people even ran
support<00:04:24.540> lobbies<00:04:24.840> because<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.050> was<00:04:25.170> pretty

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
support lobbies because it was pretty

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.460 
support lobbies because it was pretty
pretty<00:04:26.220> late<00:04:26.760> on<00:04:26.940> into<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> game<00:04:27.840> player<00:04:28.110> into

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
pretty late on into the game player into

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.380 
pretty late on into the game player into
the<00:04:28.590> black<00:04:29.040> ops<00:04:29.280> 2<00:04:29.520> before<00:04:29.760> people<00:04:30.150> started

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
the black ops 2 before people started

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.460 
the black ops 2 before people started
running<00:04:30.510> supports<00:04:31.430> support<00:04:32.430> teams<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.930> you

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
running supports support teams so you

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.070 
running supports support teams so you
know<00:04:34.590> people<00:04:35.160> back<00:04:35.280> then<00:04:35.460> we<00:04:35.550> were<00:04:35.610> using

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
know people back then we were using

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.409 
know people back then we were using
orbital<00:04:37.080> view<00:04:37.260> sets<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.830> he<00:04:38.820> still<00:04:39.060> manages

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
orbital view sets and he still manages

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.500 
orbital view sets and he still manages
to<00:04:39.450> pull<00:04:39.720> off<00:04:40.160> 229<00:04:41.160> kills<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.910> was<00:04:42.210> before

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
to pull off 229 kills this was before

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.590 
to pull off 229 kills this was before
the<00:04:43.020> swarm<00:04:43.680> was<00:04:43.919> patched<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:45.090> just<00:04:45.510> imagine

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
the swarm was patched so just imagine

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.280 
the swarm was patched so just imagine
what<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.590> game<00:04:46.919> could<00:04:47.250> have<00:04:47.430> been<00:04:47.930> if<00:04:48.930> he<00:04:48.990> had

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
what this game could have been if he had

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.080 
what this game could have been if he had
a<00:04:49.320> full<00:04:49.650> team<00:04:49.890> or<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:50.910> everything

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
a full team or if you know everything

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.600 
a full team or if you know everything
went<00:04:51.540> his<00:04:51.690> way<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:51.990> little<00:04:52.230> more<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:53.130> could<00:04:53.490> have

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
went his way a little more it could have

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.300 
went his way a little more it could have
been<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.940> first<00:04:54.120> three<00:04:54.390> undred<00:04:54.510> +<00:04:54.750> coz<00:04:54.930> 229<00:04:55.770> 27

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
been the first three undred + coz 229 27

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.330 
been the first three undred + coz 229 27
solo<00:04:56.910> with<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.110> orbital<00:04:58.530> vsat<00:04:58.680> it's<00:04:59.040> pretty

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
solo with the orbital vsat it's pretty

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.510 
solo with the orbital vsat it's pretty
ridiculous<00:04:59.730> and<00:05:00.620> if<00:05:01.620> he<00:05:01.830> had<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:01.950> full<00:05:02.130> team<00:05:02.340> he

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
ridiculous and if he had a full team he

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.340 
ridiculous and if he had a full team he
probably<00:05:02.790> could<00:05:03.060> have<00:05:03.090> pulled<00:05:03.360> off<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.810> 60

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
probably could have pulled off to 60

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.350 
probably could have pulled off to 60
maybe<00:05:04.590> 300<00:05:05.190> something<00:05:05.490> crazy<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
maybe 300 something crazy like that and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.050 
maybe 300 something crazy like that and
I<00:05:07.320> just<00:05:07.500> noticed<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:08.040> was<00:05:08.070> kind<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.340> crazy

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
I just noticed that it was kind of crazy

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.909 
I just noticed that it was kind of crazy
to<00:05:09.450> think<00:05:09.480> about<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:10.260> he<00:05:10.350> only<00:05:10.500> had<00:05:10.680> two

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
to think about that he only had two

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.340 
to think about that he only had two
lethal<00:05:11.130> kill<00:05:11.490> streaks<00:05:11.760> going<00:05:11.850> and

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
lethal kill streaks going and

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.990 
lethal kill streaks going and
unfortunately<00:05:13.350> they<00:05:13.980> patched<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.460> swarm<00:05:14.790> if

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
unfortunately they patched the swarm if

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.550 
unfortunately they patched the swarm if
the<00:05:15.120> swarm<00:05:15.419> was<00:05:15.600> still<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> way<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.380> in

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
the swarm was still the way it was in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.830 
the swarm was still the way it was in
the<00:05:16.620> beginning<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.950> this<00:05:17.010> game<00:05:17.180> you'd<00:05:18.180> seal<00:05:18.419> so

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
the beginning of this game you'd seal so

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.900 
the beginning of this game you'd seal so
many<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:19.560> many<00:05:19.620> more<00:05:19.919> high<00:05:20.130> kill<00:05:20.430> gameplays

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
many so many more high kill gameplays

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.780 
many so many more high kill gameplays
because<00:05:21.840> people<00:05:22.080> would<00:05:22.169> use<00:05:22.320> lodestar<00:05:23.190> they

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
because people would use lodestar they

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.860 
because people would use lodestar they
would<00:05:23.940> take<00:05:24.060> out<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.360> orbital<00:05:24.690> they<00:05:24.750> would

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
would take out that orbital they would

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.270 
would take out that orbital they would
use<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.110> load<00:05:25.290> started<00:05:25.620> swarm<00:05:25.860> kills<00:05:26.070> him<00:05:26.160> so

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
use the load started swarm kills him so

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.620 
use the load started swarm kills him so
his<00:05:26.370> dog<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.760> his<00:05:26.970> swarm<00:05:27.210> kills<00:05:27.419> on<00:05:27.510> this

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
his dog and his swarm kills on this

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.120 
his dog and his swarm kills on this
gameplay<00:05:27.840> sounds<00:05:28.440> kind<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.590> funny<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.010> he

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
gameplay sounds kind of funny and he

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.470 
gameplay sounds kind of funny and he
kills<00:05:29.310> himself<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:29.730> that's<00:05:29.880> three<00:05:30.210> deaths

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
kills himself so that's three deaths

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.930 
kills himself so that's three deaths
already<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.930> can<00:05:31.050> take<00:05:31.200> off<00:05:31.380> at<00:05:31.530> seven<00:05:31.940> that

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
already you can take off at seven that

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.920 
already you can take off at seven that
are<00:05:33.150> not<00:05:33.450> really<00:05:33.660> legit<00:05:34.020> but<00:05:34.650> um<00:05:35.630> yeah<00:05:36.630> what<00:05:36.900> I

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
are not really legit but um yeah what I

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.990 
are not really legit but um yeah what I
was<00:05:37.080> saying<00:05:37.260> back<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.250> whole<00:05:38.490> topic<00:05:38.820> about

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
was saying back to the whole topic about

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.700 
was saying back to the whole topic about
if<00:05:39.210> he<00:05:39.419> was<00:05:39.570> using

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
if he was using

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.160 
if he was using
the<00:05:40.800> lodestar<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.240> swarm<00:05:42.510> was<00:05:42.720> as<00:05:42.930> crazy

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
the lodestar and the swarm was as crazy

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.800 
the lodestar and the swarm was as crazy
as<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.830> was<00:05:44.130> like<00:05:44.430> nowadays<00:05:44.760> if<00:05:45.030> everything

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
as it was like nowadays if everything

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.590 
as it was like nowadays if everything
was<00:05:45.870> still<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.110> same<00:05:47.060> three<00:05:48.060> hundreds<00:05:48.450> i

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
was still the same three hundreds i

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.150 
was still the same three hundreds i
think<00:05:48.840> would<00:05:48.930> just<00:05:49.140> be<00:05:49.260> popping<00:05:49.650> out<00:05:49.770> left<00:05:50.040> and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
think would just be popping out left and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.130 
think would just be popping out left and
right<00:05:50.280> honestly<00:05:50.880> because<00:05:51.120> let<00:05:51.660> loads<00:05:51.840> started

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
right honestly because let loads started

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.360 
right honestly because let loads started
be<00:05:52.200> going<00:05:52.410> to<00:05:52.500> work<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.830> even<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.070> lodestar

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
be going to work and even the lodestar

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.580 
be going to work and even the lodestar
got<00:05:53.520> buff<00:05:53.700> so<00:05:53.910> with<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.660> load<00:05:54.810> start<00:05:55.110> shooting

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
got buff so with the load start shooting

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.800 
got buff so with the load start shooting
as<00:05:55.680> fast<00:05:55.890> as<00:05:55.980> it<00:05:56.100> used<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:57.180> swarm<00:05:57.510> just

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
as fast as it used to and the swarm just

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.990 
as fast as it used to and the swarm just
going<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.230> work<00:05:58.410> as<00:05:58.620> as<00:05:58.920> much<00:05:59.400> as<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.670> used<00:05:59.700> to

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
going to work as as much as it used to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.820 
going to work as as much as it used to
three<00:06:00.690> hundreds<00:06:00.930> would<00:06:01.050> be<00:06:01.140> so<00:06:01.320> much<00:06:01.530> more

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
three hundreds would be so much more

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.830 
three hundreds would be so much more
possible<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.760> be<00:06:02.940> popping<00:06:03.480> out<00:06:03.570> left<00:06:03.780> and

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
possible to be popping out left and

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.230 
possible to be popping out left and
right<00:06:03.960> but<00:06:04.890> you<00:06:05.550> know<00:06:05.640> people<00:06:05.880> just<00:06:05.910> didn't

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
right but you know people just didn't

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.660 
right but you know people just didn't
run<00:06:06.570> support<00:06:07.080> teams<00:06:07.320> back<00:06:07.500> then<00:06:07.740> so<00:06:08.100> that's

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
run support teams back then so that's

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.370 
run support teams back then so that's
the<00:06:09.180> way<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.360> goes<00:06:09.420> unfortunately<00:06:09.960> nobody

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
the way it goes unfortunately nobody

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.650 
the way it goes unfortunately nobody
started<00:06:10.890> earlier<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.550> yeah<00:06:12.210> now<00:06:12.390> we're<00:06:12.540> at

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
started earlier and yeah now we're at

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.090 
started earlier and yeah now we're at
the<00:06:12.750> time<00:06:12.960> where<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.170> lot<00:06:13.380> of<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.530> killstreaks

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100
