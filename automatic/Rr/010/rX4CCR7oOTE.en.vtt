00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 Talk group of the beauty group, neither one 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.800
 Another question I received was how 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.820
 I build my own model 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.980
 which parts you need to assemble your 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.369
 own model you need to know one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.010
 little more of what the model was like 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.380
 I always recommend the first 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 model is better to buy already ready already 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 bought for you to look at and this is it here 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 come here this assumes that this here 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 stay here because you will follow at least the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 the same line in almost all 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 models have some that are different 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.110
 behind- the-front engines but 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 specific issues but the general idea 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 how the connections are 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 how the brain stays connected in the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
 command 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 and you'll know it's still the same 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 equipment that needs trouble from it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 the model in itself his body trend 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.329
 few things that are model 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 Then you 'll need to start from the front. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.710
 back to it if you will use the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.619
 mechanism to save those who call 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 of Portuguese itself is that it is English 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.229
 and tied with rubber though 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 of this rubber and the motor itself 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.869
 there the amount of the engine that can be a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.810
 Wood is already a business that is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 to make our wood there 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 the ESC that will control the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.860
 The speed of this counted will be 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 connected to the battery and then 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.770
 charge batteries despite a 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.520
 loader 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 This does not look like a model, but it's 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 considered a device that is necessary 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 Not only can you use it, it 's radio replayed 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.610
 receiver that is also connected to it and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.270
 the brains that will make the commands is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 long and deep or these things there 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.850
 details for you to call this one 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.580
 need a 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.270
 what they call home is a triangle 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.740
 zinho fits where you are in charge and 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.010
 he who will push and pull the command 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.140
 so are you going to connect the brain 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.970
 in this so that the movement of the brain 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.580
 whether it is replicated in the command pushes or is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.290
 pulls right 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:43.000
 and maybe some extension for sure to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.490
 you are to reach is the receiver that is where 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.550
 the brain will basically stay connected 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.130
 are these equipment and already taking advantage 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.830
 aa question that also made what 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.550
 equipment use in the sesi is practically 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.500
 these devices there is usually the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.110
 What is it used for? I'm going to talk about a 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.800
 but it will not be as it is. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.200
 Each plant has weight have a size and 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.380
 have to see that the engine that should be 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.710
 used for it but commonly used one 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:22.450
 8-inch engine propeller and max is 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:26.440
 28 22 with 20 amp sc a single battery 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.050
 thousand and 300-2 to 200 thousand and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.380
 depending on what you are going to charge and how 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.060
 such was the Serbian model servants 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.130
 microscope of 9 grams r is already 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.950
 sufficient for this type of aircraft is 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.710
 trick is another element 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.280
 That's pretty much what you're about 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.550
 I need hope to have answered and even 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.550
 next
