00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
dispenser not a dropper because for this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
dispenser not a dropper because for this
they<00:01:58.469> will<00:01:58.680> shoot<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> egg<00:01:59.490> rather<00:01:59.759> than

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
they will shoot out the egg rather than

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.240 
they will shoot out the egg rather than
just<00:02:00.149> dropping<00:02:00.630> eggs<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.740> necessary

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to put a comparator right here sing out

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.010 
to put a comparator right here sing out
from<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> side

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
