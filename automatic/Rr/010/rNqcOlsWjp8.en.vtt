warfare<00:04:36.729> 3<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:39.160> dome<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:39.910> think<00:04:40.540> you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
warfare 3 like like dome I think you

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960 
warfare 3 like like dome I think you
know<00:04:41.169> dome<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.710> good<00:04:42.010> map<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.820> had

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
know dome was a good map but it just had

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.060 
know dome was a good map but it just had
so<00:04:43.300> many<00:04:43.510> ins<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.110> outs<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.500> certain<00:04:44.889> of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
so many ins and outs of certain of

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.909 
so many ins and outs of certain of
certain<00:04:45.639> rooms<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:47.110> whether<00:04:47.560> that's<00:04:47.800> to

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
certain rooms and whether that's to

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.010 
certain rooms and whether that's to
prevent<00:04:48.130> camping<00:04:48.820> or<00:04:49.000> what<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.210> don't<00:04:49.479> know<00:04:49.690> but

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020

like babe you maybe I haven't figured

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.080 
like babe you maybe I haven't figured
out<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.740> good<00:04:53.919> strategy<00:04:54.160> for<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.699> yet<00:04:54.940> you

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
out a good strategy for that yet you

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.360 
out a good strategy for that yet you
know<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.930> course<00:04:56.139> staying<00:04:56.560> on<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.860> outside

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
know of course staying on the outside

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.610 
know of course staying on the outside
perimeter<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.449> map<00:04:58.660> with<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> sniper<00:04:59.260> with

of<00:05:01.840> course<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.380> rooms<00:05:02.620> would<00:05:02.770> be<00:05:02.919> good<00:05:03.150> but

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
of course and rooms would be good but

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.920
