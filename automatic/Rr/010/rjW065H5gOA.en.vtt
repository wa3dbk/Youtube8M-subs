00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
remember the remember the placement of

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.729 
remember the remember the placement of
everything<00:00:47.629> on<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.870> logic<00:00:48.050> board<00:00:48.229> and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
everything on the logic board and

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.680 
everything on the logic board and
everything<00:00:49.040> but<00:00:49.400> I<00:00:49.460> got<00:00:49.640> really<00:00:49.909> warm<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:50.540> can

everything but I got really warm I can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.350 
everything but I got really warm I can
feel<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.050> heat<00:00:51.080> it's<00:00:51.470> almost<00:00:51.800> almost<00:00:52.760> too<00:00:53.180> hot

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
feel the heat it's almost almost too hot

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.130 
feel the heat it's almost almost too hot
to<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.540> touch<00:00:55.360> but<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:56.510> whole<00:00:56.629> area<00:00:56.900> is<00:00:56.930> hot

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
to the touch but this whole area is hot

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.979 
to the touch but this whole area is hot
and<00:00:57.290> this<00:00:57.409> sides<00:00:57.680> no<00:00:57.890> rather<00:00:58.070> cool<00:00:58.339> you<00:00:58.519> know

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
and this sides no rather cool you know

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.509 
and this sides no rather cool you know
so<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.879> have<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:02.890> what<00:01:03.890> is<00:01:04.010> this<00:01:04.100> more<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.370> a

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
so I have a what is this more of a

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.760 
so I have a what is this more of a
surface<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.210> know<00:01:05.540> thermal<00:01:06.110> temperature<00:01:06.260> so

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
surface you know thermal temperature so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.370 
surface you know thermal temperature so
the<00:01:07.250> wall<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:07.580> seventy<00:01:07.940> seven<00:01:08.240> point<00:01:08.390> five<00:01:08.659> and

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the wall is seventy seven point five and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.450 
the wall is seventy seven point five and
I<00:01:09.409> know<00:01:09.560> you're<00:01:09.710> not<00:01:09.799> supposed<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.100> point<00:01:10.310> at

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460

so just two let's see if we can get an

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.550 
so just two let's see if we can get an

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
looking at a hundred and four degrees

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.210 
looking at a hundred and four degrees
coming<00:01:26.510> out<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:26.990> spot<00:01:27.350> right<00:01:27.500> there<00:01:27.560> okay

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
coming out of that spot right there okay

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.870 
coming out of that spot right there okay
so<00:01:28.910> let's<00:01:29.180> go<00:01:29.360> over<00:01:29.390> here<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.550> you're<00:01:31.550> looking

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
at you're almost looking at a 10 degree

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.670 
at you're almost looking at a 10 degree
difference<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:38.540> know<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.500> matter

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
difference in you know the in a matter

difference in you know the in a matter
of<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.010> area<00:01:40.370> now<00:01:40.760> like<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.000> said<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.780> may<00:01:42.470> not

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
of that area now like I said it may not

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.560 
of that area now like I said it may not
be<00:01:42.830> too<00:01:43.040> big<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.370> lie<00:01:43.550> considering<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.420> don't

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
be too big of a lie considering I don't

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.910 
be too big of a lie considering I don't
know<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.810> placement<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.260> what's<00:01:45.500> right<00:01:45.890> under

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
know the placement of what's right under

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.130 
know the placement of what's right under
the<00:01:46.190> keyboard<00:01:46.370> right<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.540> being<00:01:47.930> is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the keyboard right here but being is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.860 
the keyboard right here but being is
everything<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.920> warm<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:49.820> just<00:01:50.630> seems<00:01:50.780> a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
everything is so warm it just seems a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.110 
everything is so warm it just seems a
lot<00:01:51.020> warmer<00:01:51.350> than<00:01:51.500> usual<00:01:52.070> -<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:54.260> me<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.440> guess

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
lot warmer than usual - to me I guess

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.149 
lot warmer than usual - to me I guess
but<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.240> know<00:01:56.330> like<00:01:56.510> again<00:01:56.960> just<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.830> test<00:01:58.010> it

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
but you know like again just to test it

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.740 
but you know like again just to test it
out<00:01:58.280> you're<00:01:58.850> looking<00:01:58.970> at<00:01:59.270> 106<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.540> max

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
out you're looking at 106 so the max

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.410 
out you're looking at 106 so the max
temperature<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.200> wave<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.470> 106<00:02:03.920> 103<00:02:04.490> 104<00:02:04.940> and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
temperature I wave is 106 103 104 and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.100 
temperature I wave is 106 103 104 and
over<00:02:06.140> here<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:06.860> corner<00:02:08.319> 95<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
over here in this corner 95 so the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.750 
over here in this corner 95 so the
temperature<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.800> big<00:02:13.099> difference<00:02:13.250> and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
temperature is a big difference and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.680 
temperature is a big difference and
let's<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.120> there's<00:02:14.300> anything<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.629> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
let's see if there's anything on the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.220 
let's see if there's anything on the
keyboard<00:02:15.110> rather<00:02:16.510> 95<00:02:17.510> no<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.720> said<00:02:17.959> it's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
keyboard rather 95 no you said it's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.360 
keyboard rather 95 no you said it's
still<00:02:18.379> rather<00:02:18.560> warm<00:02:18.830> right<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.129> but
