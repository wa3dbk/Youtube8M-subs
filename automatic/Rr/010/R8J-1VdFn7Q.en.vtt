00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
one go copy and you go to memory unit or

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.920 
one go copy and you go to memory unit or
memory<00:02:39.750> stick<00:02:40.040> doesn't<00:02:41.040> matter<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:42.510> ahead<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
memory stick doesn't matter go ahead and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.470 
memory stick doesn't matter go ahead and
copy<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.740> then<00:02:44.430> after<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.910> copy<00:02:45.270> the

second one as well um the for the second

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.740 
second one as well um the for the second
one<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:50.580> really<00:02:50.820> quickly<00:02:51.090> compared<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
one goes really quickly compared to the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.220 
one goes really quickly compared to the
first<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:56.540> okay<00:02:57.540> that's<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.840> first<00:02:58.050> one

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
