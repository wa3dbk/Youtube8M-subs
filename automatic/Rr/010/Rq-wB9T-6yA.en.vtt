wafer thin very very thin they also say
weighs<00:00:59.699> 3<00:01:00.149> grams<00:01:00.510> let's<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.680> my

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
weighs 3 grams let's have a look on my

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
weighs 3 grams let's have a look on my
little<00:01:01.980> scales<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.820> wait<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.989> those<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
little scales here wait for those to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.810 
little scales here wait for those to
start<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.979> let's<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> does<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
start up and let's see if it does in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.469 
start up and let's see if it does in
fact<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.270> 3<00:01:06.600> grams<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.180> it's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
fact way 3 grams so there we go it's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
fact way 3 grams so there we go it's
actually<00:01:09.630> weighing<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:11.430> point<00:01:11.880> nine

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
actually weighing in at two point nine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually weighing in at two point nine
grams<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.170> under<00:01:13.710> three<00:01:14.010> grams<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.610> weight<00:01:14.790> for

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
grams so under three grams in weight for

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
grams so under three grams in weight for
this<00:01:16.110> case<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.549> obviously<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.880> going

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this case now it's obviously not going

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
this case now it's obviously not going
to<00:01:18.150> offer<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> protection<00:01:19.259> but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to offer up a lot of protection but

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
to offer up a lot of protection but
let's<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.180> iphone<00:01:21.659> 5<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
let's put this on to the iphone 5 now

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
let's put this on to the iphone 5 now
I've<00:01:23.009> already<00:01:23.159> got<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> screen<00:01:23.729> protector<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
I've already got a screen protector on

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
I've already got a screen protector on
my<00:01:24.450> iPhone<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> install<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
my iPhone so I don't need to install the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.749 
my iPhone so I don't need to install the
supplied<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.920> saw<00:01:29.070> pop<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
supplied one and we just saw pop this on

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.890 
supplied one and we just saw pop this on
like<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> ease<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.920> round<00:01:32.659> forth<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
like so we just ease this round forth in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.980 
like so we just ease this round forth in
case<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.560> quite<00:01:34.979> difficult<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.600> two

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
case is quite difficult to get these two

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.760 
case is quite difficult to get these two
bottom<00:01:37.380> corners<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.409> place

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
bottom corners on but they are in place

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.969 
bottom corners on but they are in place
and<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> phone<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and that is on the phone and that is it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
and that is on the phone and that is it
is<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.060> thin<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is so so thin this is one of the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.569 
is so so thin this is one of the
thinnest<00:01:46.710> cases<00:01:47.250> I've<00:01:47.880> ever<00:01:47.939> ever<00:01:48.750> seen<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
thinnest cases I've ever ever seen it is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.450 
thinnest cases I've ever ever seen it is
wafer<00:01:51.090> thin<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:52.290> fact<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:52.979> thin<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.340> can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
wafer thin in fact it's so thin you can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.109 
wafer thin in fact it's so thin you can
see<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> bottom<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.930> its<00:01:55.649> source

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
see here on the bottom that its source

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
see here on the bottom that its source
lightly<00:01:57.119> bulging<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.320> bottom<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
lightly bulging on the bottom there so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
lightly bulging on the bottom there so
it's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> very<00:01:59.219> tight<00:01:59.880> fit<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.049> got<00:02:01.170> full

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it's a very tight fit we still got full

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
it's a very tight fit we still got full
access<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.509> speaker<00:02:03.509> microphone
