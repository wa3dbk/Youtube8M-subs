out<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
out it kind of just as you know it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
out it kind of just as you know it
visible<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:55.980> less<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.670> claiming<00:00:57.149> this

visible more or less not claiming this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
visible more or less not claiming this
is<00:00:57.660> literally<00:00:58.590> invisible<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.730> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
is literally invisible and that you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
is literally invisible and that you
can't<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> does<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.350> job

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
can't see it but it does do a good job

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
can't see it but it does do a good job
of<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.309> blending<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.420> standing

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
of kind of blending in and not standing

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
of kind of blending in and not standing
out<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.799> type<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> gaudy<00:01:05.430> object<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.360> your

desk or anything like that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.000 
desk or anything like that
now<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> high<00:01:09.420> rise<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:10.530> some

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
now I do think the high rise has some

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.640 
now I do think the high rise has some
perks<00:01:11.280> over<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.450> actual<00:01:12.900> lift<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
perks over this one the actual lift and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
perks over this one the actual lift and
like<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> adjustment<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> high<00:01:15.780> rises<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like the adjustment on the high rises in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
like the adjustment on the high rises in
the<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.770> leaves<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> front<00:01:17.340> open

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
recommend to not actually type or use
the<00:01:47.369> mouse<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.780> use<00:01:48.930> external

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the mouse on it but to use external

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.410 
the mouse on it but to use external
peripherals<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.149> stable

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
peripherals so this is actually stable

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
peripherals so this is actually stable
enough<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> strong<00:01:52.320> enough<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.920> can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
enough and strong enough that you can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
enough and strong enough that you can
type<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> directly<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.229> may

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
type and use it directly on it it may

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
type and use it directly on it it may
not<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> super<00:01:55.829> comfortable<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.180> be

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
not be super comfortable but it can be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
not be super comfortable but it can be
done<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.560> silicone<00:01:59.100> strips<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
done so there are silicone strips on the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
done so there are silicone strips on the
top<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> bottom<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.920> hopper
