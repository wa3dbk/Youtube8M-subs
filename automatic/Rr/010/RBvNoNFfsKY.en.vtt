00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.480
 here in brazil people need 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.040
 two things to feel good about 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.920
 christus and heroes ie need to be 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.420
 crucifying someone and on the other hand 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 idolizing others 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.369
 enough we will observe the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.279
 history of the Brazilian 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 soccer at all times had with the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.369
 coach and a player and the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.579
 late and for more nonsense than this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.850
 idolized player was always to blame 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.540
 it was the technician's job the technician was crucified 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.050
 and the idolized player even though he 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.420
 had done the worst possible things 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.649
 This story is now repeated again in the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 american cup 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.250
 neymar did a lot of bullshit 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 during the game 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.859
 I was expelled received a suspension of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.100
 four games and many people still 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.750
 were helpless neymar as if the fault 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 from dunga 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 Look, to tell you the truth, I do not 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.820
 I'm not even there for the dunga and not for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 Nilmar Neymar and he hates soccer 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 Sorry for the listeners here but I 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.740
 I really do not like football. 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 I think the sport is but dull there 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.479
 but in this reaction of commentators and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.799
 also of the Brazilian population in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 relation to dunga 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.520
 we have exactly the way things are 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 here we try to exempt some people 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 in guilt if you try to blame them for guilt 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.710
 and accuse others of a fault that does not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 they compete 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.049
 the neymar case that dunga is precisely 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.299
 This is not the first time this 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.079
 happened in the Brazilian selection of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.600
 soccer 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.240
 from time to time this question comes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.590
 happening and why because the people 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.939
 need to crucify someone and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.820
 idolize the train is like niti said 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.250
 miserable people who need idols 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.400
 the Brazilian people are idolaters for 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.380
 nature like we think about pelÃ© 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.340
 ayrton sena 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 romario neymar and so on goes the list is 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 long 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 I could now cite hundreds or who 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 knows even thousands of heroes and idols of the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.620
 Brazilians what that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 say that a good portion of the Brazilian people 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.580
 has no attitude has no inner life 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.540
 does not have something of its own and needs it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.830
 put their hopes on the idol or 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.070
 a hero 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.920
 which are the people who can evolve who can 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.130
 you need drugs like 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.490
 soccer players as sportsmen 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.890
 as television actors, which is the country 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.500
 that can work where people are so 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.660
 idolatrous like here in Brazil 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.810
 this is an issue that needs to be addressed 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.810
 analyzed I see that this has been happening 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.110
 knocked people do not stop to think 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.170
 about this idolatry that exists here in the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.070
 Brazil is not just a sport in the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 novels but also in politics what is the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.190
 lord luiz inacio lula da silva 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.230
 mollusc thief snag united for good 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.200
 portion of the Brazilian population 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.320
 I saw these days in a video of a 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.510
 defender of the moon as a dot eater 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.420
 mortadella he said he will 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.220
 defend the squid with his own life 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.459
 what if it is necessary 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.400
 he dies for his political leader and 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.910
 The end of the video is not here. 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.230
 a threat but a conviction of that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.400
 that I believe 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.610
 Now this is really absurd. 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.520
 we do not need to attack anyone 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.310
 we do not need heroes and we do not 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.180
 We need to praise our 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.700
 similar 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.520
 And we do not even need to crucify anyone. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.570
 also because here in Brazil there are 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.240
 extremes 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.670
 on the one hand if someone is crucified and 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.580
 The other side idolizes 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.860
 let's think a little about time and 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.180
 government of fhc 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.319
 nani rick cardoso he was crucified 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.830
 constantly by opposition 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:34.740
 rio Lula was idolized the squid was the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.360
 God here in Brazil and what happened 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.449
 as soon as he came to power 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.240
 the greatest misfortune we have had in all 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.449
 the history of Brazil noise right 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.590
 the man exalted the worker president 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.509
 it is actually the greatest of the vagabond these 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.159
 Gentlemen, our lula da silva. 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:58.740
 but of so much that was idolized 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.990
 exalted the Brazilian population was 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.569
 blind to this reality 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.409
 and this is a fact that we get 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:10.770
 easy to find idolatrous people are 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.129
 blind people and be fooled too 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.979
 easy people who are not idolaters they 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.949
 are more aware and more critical 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.189
 and has the ability to judge your 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.830
 authorities separating wheat tares 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:28.409
 in the middle of all this index that the people 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.139
 unfortunately not yet. 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:34.860
 can do this the Brazilian people 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.580
 waiting for the saviors of the motherland for 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.949
 public people to get there and solve 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.800
 the problem of the Brazilian nation 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.900
 few problems that are many, not just 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.020
 that this is impossible 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.839
 solutions do not fall from the sky and 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.469
 solutions to problems do not come from 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.960
 a particular person but of the whole 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:02.000
 whole society when society is 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.580
 if the culture evolves and existentially 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.250
 then does society become empowered to 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.529
 solve their problems and also 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.169
 The lives of all people end up 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.990
 improving but unfortunately here in the 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.770
 Brazil, the people are still against the 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.520
 story 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.279
 the people and the people for the people exalt 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.250
 certain individuals and does not understand 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:29.460
 It is up to each human being to 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.039
 your life and make your life something 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.919
 productive so that the individual 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.180
 I can also be happy, it's not a game of 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.970
 soccer 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.880
 bring me happiness is not my idol 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.610
 which can brighten me up and the 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.130
 own project of life is necessary. 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.160
 I need to bet on myself I need 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.930
 struggle to work and study to accomplish 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.630
 my dreams so yes I will be 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.490
 solving my problems and 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.070
 achieving my goals and 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.830
 is not through idolatry. 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.470
 and it is not through the exaltation of 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:11.310
 no one who gets this quality 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:15.840
 Do you live here in Brazil? 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.039
 if you crucify some and worship idolatry 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.070
 outs 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.620
 now neymar was guilty in the game because 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.860
 part of the Brazilian population still 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.320
 now wants to defend the boy looks at the 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.979
 boy who is actually a man made 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.370
 already wanting to put neymar in the condition 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:37.919
 My idolatry, my idolatry. 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.949
 I do not really 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:43.620
 dunga nor neymar because I do not like 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:46.199
 football and I do not like any idolatry 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.510
 but I decided to do this reflection here 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.750
 to show that the Brazilian people are 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:55.080
 very superficial and immature and that 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:58.729
 need idols to come and feel 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.310
 happy but those who practice idolatry are 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:05.550
 doomed to unhappiness 

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:07.409
 material poverty and existential poverty 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.360
 What do we have here in Brazil? 

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:11.360
 unfortunately 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.990
 Wow, people, a big hug for you. 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.990
 keep mothers
