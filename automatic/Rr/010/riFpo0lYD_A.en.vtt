think it may be because I got the

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.750 
think it may be because I got the
specific<00:03:47.379> one<00:03:47.530> for<00:03:47.560> hair<00:03:47.950> color<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.639> may

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
specific one for hair color so it may

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.759 
specific one for hair color so it may
not<00:03:48.940> work<00:03:49.000> as<00:03:49.389> good<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:51.099> it<00:03:51.310> works<00:03:51.489> okay<00:03:51.819> and
