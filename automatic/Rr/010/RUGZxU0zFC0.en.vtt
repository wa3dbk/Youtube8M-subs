00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.680
 As you can see we put the tube 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 on the curved wall of the tool and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 we turn the moving part of the folding to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 make the curve 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.920
 this tool allows you to make curves in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.920
 a team in spirals 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.679
 Now let's fit two tubes with the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.519
 same diameter as they should be 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:54.839
 welded one of the tubes works as 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.600
 male than the other as female tube 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.620
 male must enter with two or three 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.050
 mm in the female tube 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.740
 now attach the female tube to the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.980
 gag to extend its end or 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.960
 is to increase the internal diameter for 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.960
 to fit the male tube 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.450
 we should use this tool to drop 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.500
 the tube carefully observe how 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.500
 we increase the internal diameter of the tube 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.110
 make sure that the inside diameter of the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.110
 tube is half an inch 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.729
 soon we loosened the gag and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.670
 we removed the female tube and checked 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.479
 if the male tube fits perfectly in the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.479
 female tube 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:03.180
 Let's now weld the two out of pocket. 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.579
 here we have an oxygen cylinder with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.950
 its corresponding control key 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.950
 installed at the top
