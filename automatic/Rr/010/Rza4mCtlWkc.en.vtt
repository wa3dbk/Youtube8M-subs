00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.520 
what you're not seeing in there is
another<00:04:56.360> inverter<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:57.110> hasn't<00:04:57.410> been

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
another inverter that hasn't been

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.180 
another inverter that hasn't been
installed<00:04:57.710> yet<00:04:58.130> it's<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.789> 24<00:04:59.539> volt<00:05:00.190> inverter

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
installed yet it's a 24 volt inverter

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.360 
installed yet it's a 24 volt inverter
that<00:05:01.400> will<00:05:02.350> convert<00:05:03.350> it<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.530> 220<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.220> that's

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
that will convert it to 220 and that's

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.330 
that will convert it to 220 and that's
what<00:05:04.520> we'll<00:05:04.610> wire<00:05:04.789> up<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.240> outlet<00:05:05.510> there

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
what we'll wire up to that outlet there

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.580 
what we'll wire up to that outlet there
okay<00:05:07.340> it's<00:05:07.550> been<00:05:07.729> about<00:05:07.910> 12<00:05:08.240> minutes<00:05:08.600> see<00:05:09.470> if

all right so now that we've completed
testing<00:06:19.610> of<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.820> hot-water<00:06:20.030> panel<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:20.930> we

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
testing of the hot-water panel and we

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.720 
testing of the hot-water panel and we
know<00:06:21.170> it<00:06:21.320> works<00:06:21.530> we<00:06:21.950> got<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.250> mount<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.610> up

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
know it works we got to mount it up

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.110 
know it works we got to mount it up
there<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.920> we'll<00:06:24.920> just<00:06:25.130> tuck<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.550> tubes<00:06:25.790> in

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
there and we'll just tuck the tubes in

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.170 
there and we'll just tuck the tubes in
and<00:06:26.530> have<00:06:27.530> them<00:06:27.650> accessible<00:06:28.030> so<00:06:29.030> when<00:06:29.120> you

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
and have them accessible so when you

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.090 
and have them accessible so when you
take<00:06:29.360> it<00:06:29.540> out<00:06:29.660> somewhere<00:06:30.050> you<00:06:30.260> just<00:06:30.290> drop<00:06:30.980> them

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
take it out somewhere you just drop them

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.310 
take it out somewhere you just drop them
down<00:06:31.220> into<00:06:31.550> a<00:06:31.580> like<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.360> forty<00:06:32.750> fifty<00:06:33.020> gallon

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
down into a like a forty fifty gallon

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.560 
down into a like a forty fifty gallon
barrel<00:06:33.760> fill<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.880> barrel<00:06:35.120> off<00:06:35.180> with<00:06:35.330> water

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
barrel fill the barrel off with water

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.540 
barrel fill the barrel off with water
recirculate<00:06:36.440> it<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:36.680> Sun<00:06:36.860> all<00:06:37.040> day<00:06:37.070> and<00:06:37.430> then

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
recirculate it and Sun all day and then

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.220 
recirculate it and Sun all day and then
you'll<00:06:37.700> have<00:06:37.850> nice<00:06:38.060> hot<00:06:38.330> shower<00:06:38.360> water<00:06:39.050> at

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
you'll have nice hot shower water at

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.720 
you'll have nice hot shower water at
night<00:06:40.600> the<00:06:41.600> Sun<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.230> beating<00:06:43.100> down<00:06:43.280> on<00:06:43.610> this

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
night the Sun is beating down on this

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.330

yes it's got seven point two amps coming
in<00:07:06.890> off<00:07:07.040> of<00:07:07.220> that<00:07:07.340> panel<00:07:07.610> right<00:07:07.760> now<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.840> you

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
in off of that panel right now and you

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.500 
in off of that panel right now and you
see<00:07:09.200> the<00:07:09.380> little<00:07:10.130> square<00:07:10.610> bars<00:07:10.940> on<00:07:11.150> the<00:07:11.270> side

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
see the little square bars on the side

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.150 
see the little square bars on the side
they<00:07:11.750> go<00:07:11.900> all<00:07:12.050> the<00:07:12.080> way<00:07:12.200> up<00:07:12.350> to<00:07:12.470> the<00:07:12.590> top<00:07:12.830> so

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
they go all the way up to the top so

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160 
they go all the way up to the top so
when<00:07:13.310> they<00:07:13.430> reach<00:07:13.640> the<00:07:13.880> top<00:07:14.120> the<00:07:14.750> batteries

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
when they reach the top the batteries
