fact that Seattle is maybe become the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.550 
fact that Seattle is maybe become the
center<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.000> glass<00:05:40.390> in<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.870> way<00:05:41.020> that's<00:05:41.320> pretty

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
center of glass in a way that's pretty

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.030 
center of glass in a way that's pretty
incredible<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.490> but<00:05:43.450> yet<00:05:43.660> that's<00:05:44.620> how<00:05:44.800> things

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
happen what has also happened is the

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.350 
happen what has also happened is the
transformation<00:05:48.190> of<00:05:48.610> pilchuck<00:05:49.060> from<00:05:49.270> a

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
transformation of pilchuck from a

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.480 
transformation of pilchuck from a
tightly<00:05:49.750> knit<00:05:49.780> professional<00:05:50.530> family<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.430> a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
tightly knit professional family to a

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.850 
tightly knit professional family to a
full-scale<00:05:51.940> artistic<00:05:52.510> institution<00:05:53.200> whether

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
full-scale artistic institution whether

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.740 
full-scale artistic institution whether
the<00:05:54.100> glass<00:05:54.340> community<00:05:54.940> can<00:05:55.150> stay<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.570> close

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
the glass community can stay so close

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.260 
the glass community can stay so close

and whether pilchuck can remain so vital
is<00:05:58.419> one<00:05:58.870> of<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.080> problematic<00:05:59.740> questions<00:06:00.220> of

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
is one of the problematic questions of

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.090 
is one of the problematic questions of
success<00:06:00.970> it's<00:06:01.540> gotten<00:06:01.900> big<00:06:02.200> and<00:06:02.530> people<00:06:02.860> make

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
success it's gotten big and people make

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.670 
success it's gotten big and people make
one<00:06:03.490> thing<00:06:03.729> but<00:06:04.120> if<00:06:04.270> you<00:06:04.630> know<00:06:05.200> an<00:06:05.290> Isaan<00:06:05.590> is

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
one thing but if you know an Isaan is

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.980 
one thing but if you know an Isaan is
like<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:06.100> didn't<00:06:06.640> ten<00:06:06.850> years<00:06:07.090> ago<00:06:07.240> if<00:06:07.479> nobody

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
like a didn't ten years ago if nobody

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.350 
like a didn't ten years ago if nobody
had<00:06:08.200> any<00:06:08.380> shows<00:06:08.710> nobody's<00:06:09.250> making<00:06:09.550> any<00:06:09.669> money

had any shows nobody's making any money
you<00:06:10.840> know<00:06:10.990> so<00:06:11.439> we<00:06:11.650> sort<00:06:11.889> of<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.009> brotherhood<00:06:12.729> of

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
you know so we sort of a brotherhood of

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.050 
you know so we sort of a brotherhood of
poverty<00:06:13.509> but<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.979> changed<00:06:15.580> time<00:06:15.879> of

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
poverty but that changed time of

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.600 
poverty but that changed time of
