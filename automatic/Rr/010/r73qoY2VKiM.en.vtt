00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
mine and then the third game now this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.970 
mine and then the third game now this
one's<00:02:46.459> called<00:02:46.640> guess<00:02:46.970> what's<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.540> bag<00:02:47.980> so

we put baby items in these little burlap
sacks<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.070> pass<00:02:52.340> them<00:02:52.580> around<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.000> shower

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
sacks and pass them around to the shower

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.760 
sacks and pass them around to the shower
guests<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.780> they<00:02:53.959> had<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.170> guess<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.560> was<00:02:54.650> in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
guests and they had to guess what was in

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.310 
guests and they had to guess what was in
the<00:02:54.860> bag<00:02:55.010> now<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.970> burlap<00:02:56.600> sacks<00:02:56.930> are<00:02:57.290> a

the bag now the burlap sacks are a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.820 
the bag now the burlap sacks are a
little<00:02:57.980> see-through<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.030> what<00:02:59.240> we<00:02:59.360> did<00:02:59.570> is<00:03:00.020> you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
little see-through so what we did is you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.370 
little see-through so what we did is you
made<00:03:01.010> these<00:03:01.190> little<00:03:01.280> zebra<00:03:01.640> sacks<00:03:02.330> for<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
made these little zebra sacks for the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.830 
made these little zebra sacks for the
items<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.040> put<00:03:04.220> them<00:03:04.340> inside<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.180> that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
items and then put them inside so that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.750 
items and then put them inside so that
no<00:03:06.110> one<00:03:06.230> could<00:03:06.380> see<00:03:06.620> what<00:03:06.860> they<00:03:06.980> were<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.459> then

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
no one could see what they were and then

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.970 
no one could see what they were and then
they<00:03:07.850> would<00:03:07.970> just<00:03:08.000> feel<00:03:09.430> through<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:11.980> little

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
they would just feel through a little

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.840 
they would just feel through a little
bag<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.600> then<00:03:15.350> try<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.769> see<00:03:16.250> if<00:03:16.550> they<00:03:16.790> could

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
bag and then try and see if they could

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.870 
bag and then try and see if they could
guess<00:03:17.180> what<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.900> items<00:03:18.200> were<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.550> items

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
guess what the items were and the items

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.000 
guess what the items were and the items
that<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.150> used<00:03:20.450> again<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.810> my<00:03:21.110> little<00:03:21.380> cheat

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
that we used again on my little cheat

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.800

harder than others and you can see here

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.960 
harder than others and you can see here
are<00:03:35.090> someone's<00:03:35.420> guesses<00:03:36.489> then<00:03:37.489> they<00:03:37.640> score

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970

games that you can do yourself very
easily<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:49.299> again<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.660> same<00:03:51.110> punches<00:03:51.830> were

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
easily and again the same punches were

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.110 
easily and again the same punches were
used<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.060> bags<00:03:53.330> as<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.780> used<00:03:54.049> for<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.700> baby

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
used for the bags as I used for the baby

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
used for the bags as I used for the baby
food<00:03:56.450> jars<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.940> way<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.390> get<00:03:59.600> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
food jars but the way that you get the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.070 
food jars but the way that you get the
inside<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.519> outside<00:04:01.700> ones<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.390> there's<00:04:02.930> two

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
inside and outside ones is there's two

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.500 
inside and outside ones is there's two
different<00:04:03.230> settings<00:04:03.739> on<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
different settings on the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.940 
different settings on the
so<00:04:05.109> this<00:04:05.500> big<00:04:06.459> punch<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.969> the<00:04:07.060> top<00:04:07.269> here<00:04:07.540> hasn't

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
so this big punch on the top here hasn't

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.619 
so this big punch on the top here hasn't
outside-in<00:04:08.950> an<00:04:09.040> inside<00:04:09.489> setting<00:04:09.939> so<00:04:10.420> if<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
outside-in an inside setting so if you

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.890 
outside-in an inside setting so if you
do<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> outside<00:04:11.049> setting<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.000> punch<00:04:15.900> you

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
do the outside setting in the punch you

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.349 
do the outside setting in the punch you
can<00:04:17.079> see<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.470> makes<00:04:17.680> just<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.820> round<00:04:19.030> circle

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
can see it makes just the round circle

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.290 
can see it makes just the round circle
and<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.769> did<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.009> inside<00:04:21.549> setting<00:04:22.030> on<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and if you did the inside setting on the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:32.159 
and if you did the inside setting on the
punch<00:04:26.250> you'll<00:04:27.250> see<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:27.850> makes<00:04:31.169> the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
punch you'll see that it makes the

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.249 
punch you'll see that it makes the
inside<00:04:32.620> circle<00:04:32.919> for<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.930> anyway<00:04:34.930> hope<00:04:35.139> you

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
inside circle for you anyway hope you

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.039 
inside circle for you anyway hope you
