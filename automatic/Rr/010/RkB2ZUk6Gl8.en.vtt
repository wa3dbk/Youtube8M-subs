00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.250 

so<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.340> just<00:00:05.580> did<00:00:05.730> something<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.300> works<00:00:07.080> so

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
so I just did something that works so

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.310 
so I just did something that works so
well<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.680> think<00:00:07.800> a<00:00:08.069> sheriff<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.870> just<00:00:09.870> got<00:00:10.020> a<00:00:10.049> hole

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
well I think a sheriff I just got a hole

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.609 
well I think a sheriff I just got a hole
in<00:00:10.350> this<00:00:10.770> pipe<00:00:11.129> that<00:00:12.500> this<00:00:13.500> fits<00:00:13.800> in<00:00:18.470> now<00:00:19.470> it's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
in this pipe that this fits in now it's

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830 
in this pipe that this fits in now it's
like<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.279> bit<00:00:20.550> over<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.849> 3/4<00:00:21.450> inch<00:00:21.480> hole

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
like a little bit over a 3/4 inch hole

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.950 
like a little bit over a 3/4 inch hole
and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:22.950> have<00:00:23.099> any<00:00:23.520> hole<00:00:24.029> saws<00:00:24.329> that<00:00:24.630> size

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and I don't have any hole saws that size

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.170 
and I don't have any hole saws that size
so<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.800> used<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.230> spade<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.790> now<00:00:29.790> the<00:00:29.849> problem

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
so I used this spade bit now the problem

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.930 
so I used this spade bit now the problem
with<00:00:30.270> speakers<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.020> that<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.489> pointy

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
with speakers is that the little pointy

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
with speakers is that the little pointy
end<00:00:33.120> has<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.809> into<00:00:34.110> something<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:35.399> soon<00:00:35.610> as

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
end has to be into something as soon as

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.420 
end has to be into something as soon as
you<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.660> know<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:37.260> -<00:00:37.560> there's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.100> pointy

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you get you know up - there's a pointy

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.830 
you get you know up - there's a pointy
end<00:00:38.490> isn't<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:38.940> anything<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.630> there's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
end isn't in anything and there's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.300 
end isn't in anything and there's
nothing<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> keep<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.530> bit<00:00:40.680> Center<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
nothing to keep the bit Center so it

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.720 
nothing to keep the bit Center so it
goes<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.580> over<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.880> place<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:43.700> took<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
goes all over the place so I took a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
goes all over the place so I took a
piece<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.120> wood<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.570> grind<00:00:45.900> it<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.170> until<00:00:46.470> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
piece of wood and grind it down until it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
piece of wood and grind it down until it
just<00:00:46.830> barely<00:00:46.950> fits<00:00:47.550> inside<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.270> pipe<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
just barely fits inside the pipe and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.569 
just barely fits inside the pipe and
just<00:00:49.020> jammed<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.740> in<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.310> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
just jammed it in there so that the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.350 
just jammed it in there so that the
drill<00:00:50.820> stayed<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> wood<00:00:51.990> so<00:00:53.060> I'm<00:00:54.060> gonna<00:00:54.210> do

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
drill stayed in the wood so I'm gonna do

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:50.410 
drill stayed in the wood so I'm gonna do
that<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.690> one

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:05.180 

now<00:01:51.420> that's<00:02:01.850> those<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.120> go<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.510> there<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.830> up

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
now that's those two go in there and up

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.419 
now that's those two go in there and up
from<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> top<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.190> pair<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> ball

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
from the top here is a pair of ball

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.680 
from the top here is a pair of ball
bearings<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.179> pipe

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
bearings in a pipe

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.230 
bearings in a pipe
now<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.110> haven't<00:02:10.259> mentioned<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> keep

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
now I haven't mentioned that I keep

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.600 
now I haven't mentioned that I keep
putting<00:02:12.630> ball<00:02:13.170> bearings<00:02:13.560> inside<00:02:13.950> pipes<00:02:14.310> but

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
putting ball bearings inside pipes but

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.150 
putting ball bearings inside pipes but
they<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:14.850> have<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> right<00:02:15.300> size<00:02:15.540> pipes<00:02:16.160> so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
they don't have the right size pipes so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.310 
they don't have the right size pipes so
I<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> take<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> smaller<00:02:18.240> pipe<00:02:18.570> cut<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
I have to take a smaller pipe cut it and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.699 
I have to take a smaller pipe cut it and
weld<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.310> piece<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.350> guess<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
weld the piece in there and I guess I

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.630 
weld the piece in there and I guess I
can<00:02:22.860> show<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:24.800> first<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.190> make<00:02:26.250> this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
can show you first I have to make this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.229 
can show you first I have to make this
fit<00:02:27.239> into<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.290> cutting<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
fit into there so I'm cutting it this is

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.920 
fit into there so I'm cutting it this is
so<00:02:30.450> ghetto

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so ghetto

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.520 
so ghetto
but<00:02:31.230> it'll<00:02:32.130> work<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:34.410> little

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
but it'll work just just my little

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.170 
but it'll work just just my little
snippers<00:02:37.250> cutting<00:02:38.250> chunks<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
snippers cutting chunks out like this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.970 
snippers cutting chunks out like this
until<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:39.989> fit

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.460 

so<00:02:43.980> yeah<00:02:44.190> that's<00:02:44.459> gonna<00:02:45.410> fit<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:48.440> when<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
so yeah that's gonna fit in there when I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.690 
so yeah that's gonna fit in there when I
actually<00:02:49.709> get<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.160> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
actually get it right so there it is and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually get it right so there it is and
most<00:02:54.060> engineers<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:55.110> tell<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.410> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
most engineers will tell you that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.990 
most engineers will tell you that
eyeballing<00:02:56.190> something<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.790> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
eyeballing something like that is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.460 
eyeballing something like that is
impossible<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:58.769> check<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.730> out<00:03:03.170> there's<00:03:04.170> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
impossible but check it out there's that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.120 
impossible but check it out there's that
welded<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> top<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.000> other<00:03:09.239> end<00:03:10.130> is

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
welded on the top and the other end is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.990 
welded on the top and the other end is
stuck<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.640> there<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.299> can<00:03:12.420> look<00:03:13.640> okay<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.700> as

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
stuck in there so it can look okay so as

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.090 
stuck in there so it can look okay so as
I<00:03:15.150> was<00:03:15.269> saying<00:03:15.330> yesterday<00:03:15.840> I'm<00:03:16.650> gonna<00:03:16.920> make

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
I was saying yesterday I'm gonna make

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.070 
I was saying yesterday I'm gonna make
one<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.430> these<00:03:17.580> now<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.420> here's<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.720> piece<00:03:21.930> of

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
one of these now so here's my piece of

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.250 
one of these now so here's my piece of
pipe<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.560> already<00:03:22.739> cut<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.260> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
pipe and I already cut it with the this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.120 
pipe and I already cut it with the this
thing<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.570> expand<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> out<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.070> I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
thing that I have to expand it out so I

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:49.700 
thing that I have to expand it out so I
can<00:03:32.370> fit<00:03:32.820> these<00:03:33.030> ball<00:03:33.330> bearings<00:03:33.360> inside<00:03:34.140> there

the<00:04:34.300> metal<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.600> gonna<00:04:34.780> heat<00:04:35.020> up<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.890> expand<00:04:36.400> a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
the metal is gonna heat up and expand a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
the metal is gonna heat up and expand a
little<00:04:36.670> bit<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.570> then<00:04:37.690> when<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.900> contracts<00:04:38.320> is
