Clips<00:04:06.660> where<00:04:06.840> you'd<00:04:07.079> only<00:04:07.260> kind<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.680> clip<00:04:07.859> in

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
Clips where you'd only kind of clip in

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.039 
Clips where you'd only kind of clip in
to<00:04:08.639> just<00:04:08.819> start<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.090> bottom<00:04:09.389> half<00:04:09.600> leaving<00:04:09.989> a

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
to just start a bottom half leaving a

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.289 
to just start a bottom half leaving a
kind<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.350> exposed<00:04:10.739> because<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.700> these<00:04:11.940> clips

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
kind of exposed because of these clips

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.319 
kind of exposed because of these clips
it's<00:04:12.900> right<00:04:13.440> around<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:14.609> can<00:04:14.730> see<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.030> is

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
it's right around so you can see that is

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.080 
it's right around so you can see that is
not<00:04:16.320> going<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.620> go<00:04:16.739> anywhere<00:04:17.039> it's<00:04:17.789> especially

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
not going to go anywhere it's especially

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670 
not going to go anywhere it's especially
good<00:04:18.359> especially<00:04:18.630> if<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.049> being<00:04:19.169> held<00:04:19.470> up

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
good especially if it's being held up

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500 
good especially if it's being held up
quite<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.919> kind<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.250> high<00:04:20.400> especially<00:04:21.150> if

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
quite a kind of high especially if

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.790 
quite a kind of high especially if
you're<00:04:21.630> having<00:04:21.810> kind<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.080> loads<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.440> symbols

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
you're having kind of loads of symbols

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.090 
you're having kind of loads of symbols
and<00:04:22.919> whatnot<00:04:23.270> it's<00:04:24.270> good<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.599> them<00:04:24.720> k

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and whatnot it's good to have them k

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.030 
and whatnot it's good to have them k
equally<00:04:25.430> spaced<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.030> at<00:04:26.660> least<00:04:26.780> then<00:04:27.050> you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
equally spaced and at least then you

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.990 
equally spaced and at least then you
know<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.400> they're<00:04:28.520> not<00:04:28.670> going<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.850> go

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
know that they're not going to go

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.890 
know that they're not going to go
anywhere<00:04:29.180> there's<00:04:29.480> not<00:04:29.600> going<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:29.840> a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
anywhere there's not going to be a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.500 
anywhere there's not going to be a
chance<00:04:30.140> of<00:04:30.290> them<00:04:30.410> fallen<00:04:31.120> gonna<00:04:32.120> be<00:04:32.180> nice<00:04:32.330> in

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
chance of them fallen gonna be nice in

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.360

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
place yeah so all in all I think that's

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.330 
place yeah so all in all I think that's
pretty<00:04:37.370> good<00:04:37.670> for<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.060> about<00:04:38.240> 100<00:04:38.810> quid

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
pretty good for the about 100 quid
