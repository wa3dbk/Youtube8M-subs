00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 this part and I want to show 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 how you can build this tnt rocket and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:19.410
 Although this will be easy with tnt then 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.480
 press the button and look now 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.150
 what happens you are thrown up 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.779
 Rock it a bit so well then build 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:39.500
 We just do it now 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.500
 needs 1 5 times 5 large field so 1234 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 and then select everything here but so 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:59.989
 Do not forget an obsidian block in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.989
 the center again with earth 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.340
 short compensation 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.050
 then we put an obsidian here 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.700
 block in the middle so you notice 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:38.450
 12345 12345 here in the middle first 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.140
 made a break here and makes 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.320
 it completely around once 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:53.290
 that also means here that is once 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.290
 perfect around brandl is so now you know 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:04.370
 you have to go up here 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:06.729
 everywhere redstone just around rap song 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.729
 drop 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 so now we put arbitrary place in 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.450
 the middle of a button so now that comes 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.540
 most important that you do not leave me people 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 that not everything has to be broken here 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.160
 you just water here in each one 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.990
 corner in every corner here every purpose 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.720
 the tenth would be directed to you 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.220
 and does no harm such 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.320
 at least once again everywhere in 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.740
 Hesse 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:48.400
 except at the button and activate 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.470
 you are thrown high yes that was 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.459
 It's not difficult here 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.310
 again, the whole seen from above 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.110
 It must look like that later and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.150
 yes, as a small hint you should 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.070
 not on a server in survival games 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 He makes in survival mode 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.140
 He should definitely be one 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.560
 other yes that was it and yes to the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.560
 next time
