 what they have said but today I will tell you the

 history of windows and their x versions 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.780
 well let's start ms 2 acronyms of

 microsoft is copera king system system 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 Microsoft's operating disk is a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 operating system for computers 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 based on x86 was the most 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 popular family of systems 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.779
 operating 2 of microsoft and the main 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 system for personal computers 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.300
 compatible with ibm pc in the decade 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 1980 and mid-1990 until it was 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 gradually replaced by systems 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 operatives that offered an interface 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.840
 user graph in particular by 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.360
 several generations of microsoft windows 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 microsoft windows 10 is an environment 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.680
 16- bit graphic operating 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.879
 developed by microsoft corporation and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.500
 released on November 20, 1985 was the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 Microsoft's first attempt 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 implement an operating environment 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 multitasking with user interface 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.650
 graphic on the pc windows platform 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.460
 10 was the first version of windows 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 He launched 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 windows 20 is an operating system of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 microsoft windows with an interface 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 16-bit user graph that was 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.759
 released on December 9, 1987 and is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.159
 the successor of microsoft windows 10 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.540
 microsoft windows 20 was completed with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.580
 windows for 286 without windows for 386 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.570
 who were replaced by 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.759
 microsoft windows 30 in may 1990 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 but with the support of microsoft during 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.300
 14 years until December 31, 2001 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.330
 who stopped receiving technical support 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 appeared in 1987 and it was a little more 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.890
 popular than the big initial version 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.660
 part of that popularity was because 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.300
 included new graphic applications 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.060
 like for example microsoft excel and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.610
 microsoft word for windows these 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.530
 could be loaded from ms 2 and run 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.530
 windows at the same time as the program and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.780
 close windows when leaving them windows 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.050
 3 x is the generic name with which 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.810
 usually know the 3 0 3 versions 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.990
 and 311 in the graphical user interface 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.270
 of microsoft system 22 microsoft 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.130
 windows was never really a system 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.430
 operative with true graphical environment 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.620
 until windows 95 became the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 first widely successful version of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.660
 windows and a rival for the macintosh and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.700
 the commodore friend in the front wii with 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.530
 these microsoft versions got 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.570
 sell windows to a larger audience 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.390
 whereas previous versions do not 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.610
 had been very well received some of 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.730
 the reasons was the wheel support and the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.020
 more advanced memory management 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 It works in protected mode to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.420
 processors 80 thousand 286 or higher with 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 Large memory support or largue 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.120

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.720

 windows 31 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.129
 the most recent one very based on two of 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.110
 Microsoft at the same time because of 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.620
 who had the same visual appearance 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.009
 two editions of windows 31 gmt are

 windows nt advanced server 31 could 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.270

 version of such who would be windows 95 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.939
 the design and plan of windows 95 windows 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:07.779
 chicago by then goes back to the 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.999
 year 1992 in March when it was launched 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:12.610
 windows 31 were developing 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:16.319
 new versions of nt and a system 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.680
 never launched windows cairo that ended up in 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.180
 nineteen ninety six 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.029
 in fact windows chicago and 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.270
 subsequently windows 95 was based on the 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:27.430
 windows interface dropped for yours 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.960
 with the release of windows 31 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.029
 microsoft saw that their systems 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.729
 began to look outdated 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:36.219
 competition was already beginning to fight for a 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.550
 more powerful and 32- bit design it 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.910
 decided the windows project tica 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.920
 windows 95 windows chicago was 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.100
 thought to leave in recent months 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.970
 of 1993 that's why he was met with 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.890
 windows 93 windows 95 is a system 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.830
 operative with graphic interface of 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.500
 hybrid user between 16 and 32 bits 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.800
 was released on August 24 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.130
 of 1995 by the software company 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.570
 microsoft with remarkable sales success 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.230
 during its development it was known as 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.300
 windows 4 by the code name girl 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.600
 replaced ms 2 as operating system 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.160
 and windows 3 x as graphical environment 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.680
 fits within the family of 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.010
 microsoft operating systems 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.380
 called windows 9x in version 22 or 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.080
 at zero bis willis 21 incorporated the 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.260
 fat32 file system in addition to 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.870
 first to then novelty type 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.090
 windows nt 40 was the fourth version of the 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.920
 microsoft windows operating system 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.590
 nt released in 1996 is a windows system 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.700
 32 bit available for stations 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.980
 work and version 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.490
 for servers with a graphical internet 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.310
 similar to windows 95 while 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.620
 offered greater stability than windows 95 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.140
 it was less flexible from the perspective 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.060
 from a desktop computer a lot of the 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.950
 stability was achieved thanks to the 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.900
 hardware virtualization and having 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.760
 applications that accessed the system to 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.590
 through the artists instead of using 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.080
 directly the hardware as it was done 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.830
 in ms-two a practice that continued with 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.520
 windows 95 windows 98 whose name in 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.520
 key that month
