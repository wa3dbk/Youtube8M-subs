chips you know how comfortable does he
look<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.770> maybe<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.400> trick<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> saying

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
look you know maybe it's trick of saying

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
look you know maybe it's trick of saying
I've<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.210> enough<00:01:09.450> chips<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I've got enough chips where I can can I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
I've got enough chips where I can can I
just<00:01:12.510> take<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> flop<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> check<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> fold

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just take off a flop and check and fold

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.710 
just take off a flop and check and fold
order<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.270> third<00:01:15.570> level<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.540> two

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
order we third level now it's a two

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.940 
order we third level now it's a two
stronger<00:01:19.170> hand<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.220 

I<00:01:26.470> think<00:01:27.470> that's<00:01:27.680> pretty<00:01:28.580> mature<00:01:28.850> there<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
I think that's pretty mature there you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.320 
I think that's pretty mature there you
have<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.470> turrets<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.400> bad<00:01:31.640> boy<00:01:31.880> what<00:01:32.270> do

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
you think I mean what would you do you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.150

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
easy as that and and think about this I

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.720 
easy as that and and think about this I
mean<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.080> trick<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.380> tree<00:01:54.650> raises<00:01:55.190> Antoine

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
mean a trick a tree raises Antoine
