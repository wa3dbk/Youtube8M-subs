today Paul is in the 1000 range there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.610 
today Paul is in the 1000 range there
are<00:00:35.100> only<00:00:35.219> three<00:00:35.940> Americans<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.410> run

under<00:00:38.129> ten<00:00:38.430> seconds<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.780> top

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
under ten seconds and as you know top

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650 
under ten seconds and as you know top
three<00:00:40.379> will<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.370> London<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:42.420> those

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.889 
three will be going to London from those
trials<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.440> Tyson<00:00:44.010> Gay<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:45.120> run<00:00:45.510> something

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
trials so if Tyson Gay can run something

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
trials so if Tyson Gay can run something
in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> 1000<00:00:46.469> range<00:00:46.920> today<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the 1000 range today I think he is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
in the 1000 range today I think he is
well<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.570> course<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> course<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:49.920> he<00:00:50.100> gets

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
well on course now of course if he gets

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
well on course now of course if he gets
into<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> 9th<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.059> something<00:00:51.390> greater<00:00:51.660> than

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
into the 9th or something greater than

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.799 
into the 9th or something greater than
that<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.949> he<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:53.940> Yugi

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that then I think he will go into Yugi

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
that then I think he will go into Yugi
Oregon<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> whole<00:00:55.739> heap<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> comfort<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Oregon with a whole heap of comfort so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
Oregon with a whole heap of comfort so
it's<00:00:57.420> certainly<00:00:57.719> possible<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.500> gonna

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's certainly possible that we're gonna

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's certainly possible that we're gonna
find<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> few<00:00:59.399> moments<00:00:59.760> whether<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.030> not

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
find out in a few moments whether or not

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
find out in a few moments whether or not
Tyson<00:01:00.539> Gay<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> chance<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
Tyson Gay has a chance to go back to the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
Tyson Gay has a chance to go back to the
