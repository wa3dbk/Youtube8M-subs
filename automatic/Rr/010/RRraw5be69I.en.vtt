either<00:01:49.179> like<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.009> same<00:01:51.399> with<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
either like kind of the same with the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.639 
either like kind of the same with the
piraka<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.890> if<00:01:54.189> it's<00:01:55.060> full<00:01:55.720> there's

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
piraka it's that if it's full there's

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.919 
piraka it's that if it's full there's
two<00:01:56.920> reasons<00:01:57.130> why<00:01:57.610> don't<00:01:57.970> like<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.509> on<00:01:58.689> the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
two reasons why don't like it on the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.219 
two reasons why don't like it on the
igniter<00:01:59.319> like<00:01:59.739> it<00:02:00.399> would<00:02:00.549> be<00:02:00.670> cool<00:02:01.030> but<00:02:01.229> see

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
igniter like it would be cool but see

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.819 
igniter like it would be cool but see
just<00:02:02.709> falls<00:02:02.979> off<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.670> all<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.439> and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
just falls off it all just like that and

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.870 
just falls off it all just like that and
if<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.849> shoot<00:02:07.209> it<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.220> different<00:02:09.670> way

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
if you shoot it like in a different way

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.250 
if you shoot it like in a different way
like<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.090> shoot<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.480> ball<00:02:16.900> then

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
like this like you shoot one ball then

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.680 
like this like you shoot one ball then
the<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.700> top<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:19.980> fly<00:02:20.980> off<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
the one on the top just fly off like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.180 
the one on the top just fly off like
that<00:02:23.040> seed<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:25.000> came<00:02:25.239> off<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:27.069> that's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that seed to just came off so that's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.789 
that seed to just came off so that's
another<00:02:27.670> reason<00:02:27.940> why<00:02:28.180> don't<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:29.290> those

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
another reason why don't like those

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.990 
another reason why don't like those
atmosphere<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:30.700> I'm<00:02:31.299> at<00:02:31.810> boats<00:02:32.079> beast<00:02:33.000> like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
atmosphere but I'm at boats beast like

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.509 
atmosphere but I'm at boats beast like
really<00:02:34.269> cool<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> piraka<00:02:35.829> had<00:02:36.220> this

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
really cool but if the piraka had this

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.289 
really cool but if the piraka had this
ball<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:38.620> it'd<00:02:38.709> make<00:02:38.889> you<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.370> not

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
ball I think it'd make you like not

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.379 
ball I think it'd make you like not
control<00:02:41.109> like<00:02:42.069> your<00:02:42.280> slave<00:02:42.430> or<00:02:42.790> something<00:02:42.940> I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
control like your slave or something I
