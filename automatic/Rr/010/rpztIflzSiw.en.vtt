00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 or 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.920
 here I bring you a video and today 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 let's see a tutorial for a station 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 of character and what do I mean by a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 craft station then very easy as 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 can see here I open the door and there's 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.630
 no mothers this is not a station 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 kraft and how to put is a place there x in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.439
 where there is nothing but what happens if 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 we enter well live and step on the plate 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.140
 not calm pressure is not going to explode 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 it's not a mine we go in and pum comes out 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 craft table eo simply activating this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.750
 pressure plate then come here to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.129
 capture what we want we can 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 have chests or whatever we want 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.609
 and just go back though 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.859
 this the door becomes open 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.440
 automatically and it goes back to hide 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.910
 the soil then this is quite useful 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.679
 for many things for example 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.719
 we can do this with any type 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.510
 of block to start then I do not know 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.160
 can therefore be used with the kraft table 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.609
 eo that it is like a greater utility 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.079
 because you can use the block that comes out or 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.789
 you could do it for example if I 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.010
 I want to change this and I want to put I do not know 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.780
 something that would also be useful would be 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.470
 is not a luminous stone then 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 we put this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 in this way and we go in and out and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 every time we enter our house or 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 our house 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.230
 what we want will enter and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 we are going to light up this area that 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.520
 we have here so I'm going to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.960
 build this and remember that it can be 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.700
 with anything if we want 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.920
 let it be a pink clay or the riva 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.240
 it is removed it re-centers and it turns to 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.280
 put then then it's something pretty 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.049
 useful and obviously this does not have to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 to be unclosed can do it I do not know 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.689
 right now I taught them how 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.789
 possible we are going to do it in a way 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.039
 different for you to see how they 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.530
 like more and how they want to do it like that 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.090
 that to start the tutorial is something very 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 simple we just have to grab 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.280
 sticky pistons we need 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 specifically 3 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.350
 we need two stone torches 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.600
 reddish we need we need three 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.420
 we need two repeaters and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.789
 we need one red stone or two 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 Now I explain why and we are a 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.909
 pressure plate or a lever that 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 this also works with levers but what 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.729
 that I do not like about the lever is that there 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.709
 have to activate both times so that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.299
 activate this mechanism that I mean that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 twice to pour we're going to break the 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.940
 door the active in this way and it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 it stays like this and so that the thing that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.030
 we have put simply you have to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.110
 to give it back already would be then it is 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.349
 what I do not like to do 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.349
 this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.230
 while with the plan while with the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.300
 pressure plate we just put it and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 when passing, it is good if we stay 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 unemployed will work the same as with 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 the lever that will remain like this and until 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.650
 that we remove ourselves as it rises but if we 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 we pass entirely and we return it to 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
 remove is simply changed alone 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 so that's why I like the dish more 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.960
 pressure and I recommend more the dish to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.430
 pressure so good let's start let's 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.160
 grab too I do not know in this we're going to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.350
 grab I do not know what you think a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.730
 a brick I do not know why it does not work 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.850
 brick but good let's grab the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:03.690
 brick so let's put a hole 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.460
 here of 3 x 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 now 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.480
 this is going to give depth of 3 and 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.430
 they are doing it super flat 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.850
 it's just up to the pet rock ok of 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.850
 this way 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.820
 very well once we have this like this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.370
 you just have to do the following 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.970
 you have to put a block of what 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 we want here the other block here and here 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.450
 we could do that when we step we're going 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.250
 here here it will transform this but it is 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.470
 what I do not like then what 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.970
 Let's do is give one more to give 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.310
 one more you just have to remove this 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.740
 another block and put it this way in 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.140
 this is going to go the pressure plate here goes 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.150
 to go redstone in this way and now what 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.160
 what we have to do is very simple 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 you just have to put a torch 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.210
 reddish stone here and then you have to 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.190
 put a repeater looking here and 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.270
 another repeater seeing here once 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.150
 that's ready, you just have to 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.120
 break one two three and of this same 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.350
 way 1 2 3 now what is it that you have to 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.020
 do you just have to put a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.880
 piston in this way and we're going to put the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.860
 block that we want to be the floor in 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.320
 this case is going to be pastor we are going to 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.300
 put it here and now the block that 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.360
 We want us to appear 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.430
 put here now once we put the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.650
 first piston let's put the blocks 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.510
 and then we're going to put this other piston 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.340
 that will go here but before putting 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.230
 piston you have to put a torch dogs 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.110
 here and it goes off 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.450
 just this side so I'm going to have 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.640
 to break this and put it this way 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.770
 and I put the block here again 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.990
 Now I just have to put a 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.090
 piston looking towards me and another piston here 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.460
 looking at me sticky all the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.770
 pieces now the only thing we have to 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.060
 do is good is going to remove this because 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.740
 it is assumed that the soil is the one that goes to 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.000
 be of hidden grass 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.280
 now let's put this in this way 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.940
 and once we step on the pressure plate 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.250
 you change it so I hope you have them 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.970
 liked if you liked leave your like and we 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.970
 we see the next
