00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
brilliant so when we're on location

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.210 
brilliant so when we're on location
doing<00:03:30.570> shoots<00:03:30.870> when<00:03:31.140> we're<00:03:31.290> tethering<00:03:31.770> what

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
doing shoots when we're tethering what

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.580 
doing shoots when we're tethering what
we<00:03:32.340> want<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.610> show<00:03:32.930> basically<00:03:33.930> our<00:03:34.170> work<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
we want to show basically our work to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.410 
we want to show basically our work to
clients<00:03:35.100> these<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.880> machines<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.240> we're

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
clients these the machines that we're

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.840 
clients these the machines that we're
using<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.930> don't<00:03:37.770> know<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.130> mentioned<00:03:38.190> but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
using I don't know if I mentioned but

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.790 
using I don't know if I mentioned but
with<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.210> UX<00:03:39.540> 32s<00:03:39.960> we<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.440> those<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.710> the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
with the UX 32s we have to those in the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.230 
with the UX 32s we have to those in the
studio<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.340> these<00:03:41.490> are<00:03:41.610> thirds<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.060> then<00:03:42.150> we

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
studio that these are thirds and then we

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.150 
studio that these are thirds and then we
have<00:03:42.360> three<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.290> basically<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.710> kind<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.950> share

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
have three so basically we kind of share

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.500 
have three so basically we kind of share
these<00:03:44.340> machines<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.850> depending<00:03:45.270> on<00:03:45.330> who's

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
these machines just depending on who's

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.690 
these machines just depending on who's
doing<00:03:45.540> what<00:03:46.020> with<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.710> MacBook<00:03:46.890> Pros<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.520> have

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
doing what with the MacBook Pros we have

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.340 
doing what with the MacBook Pros we have
three<00:03:48.180> now<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.540> studio<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.020> makes<00:03:49.200> our

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
three now in the studio this makes our

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.560 
three now in the studio this makes our
third<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:49.920> basically<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.090> depending

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
third and basically it's just depending

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.910 
third and basically it's just depending
on<00:03:51.810> what<00:03:51.870> people<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.320> doing<00:03:52.470> some<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.830> our

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
mm-hmm all right so this monster of a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.160 
mm-hmm all right so this monster of a
machine<00:04:38.670> is<00:04:39.060> what<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:39.300> consider<00:04:39.480> it's<00:04:40.020> a

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
machine is what we consider it's a

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.870 
machine is what we consider it's a
laptop<00:04:40.350> but<00:04:40.740> we've<00:04:40.860> consider<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.340> more<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.610> a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
laptop but we've consider this more of a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.460 
laptop but we've consider this more of a
mobile<00:04:42.180> workstation<00:04:42.840> or<00:04:43.020> desktop

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470

replacement<00:04:44.070> it's<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.580> 17<00:04:45.060> inch<00:04:45.180> screen<00:04:45.480> is

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
replacement it's a 17 inch screen is

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.120 
replacement it's a 17 inch screen is
rather<00:04:45.900> large<00:04:46.169> it's<00:04:46.440> around<00:04:46.620> 10

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
rather large it's around 10

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.070 
rather large it's around 10
but<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.880> reason<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.360> you're<00:04:48.480> purchasing

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
but the reason that you're purchasing

downside<00:05:42.060> is<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.360> rather<00:05:42.570> large<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:42.930> again

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
downside is it's rather large but again

shoot we can take this with us and
actually<00:05:55.050> have<00:05:55.410> our<00:05:55.650> workstation<00:05:56.340> ready<00:05:56.970> to

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
actually have our workstation ready to

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.940 
actually have our workstation ready to

as<00:06:03.120> far<00:06:03.270> as<00:06:03.360> resolution<00:06:03.960> but<00:06:04.470> it<00:06:04.560> does

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
as far as resolution but it does

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.800 
as far as resolution but it does
calibrate<00:06:05.250> extremely<00:06:05.940> well<00:06:06.150> with<00:06:06.540> like<00:06:06.750> a

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
calibrate extremely well with like a

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.050 
calibrate extremely well with like a

standard basic color calibration unit
which<00:06:09.480> makes<00:06:09.690> it<00:06:09.840> great<00:06:10.020> for<00:06:10.560> color<00:06:10.920> grading

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
which makes it great for color grading

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.790 
which makes it great for color grading
and<00:06:11.640> basically<00:06:12.090> doing<00:06:12.210> any<00:06:12.450> types<00:06:12.720> of<00:06:12.930> color

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
and basically doing any types of color

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.500 
and basically doing any types of color
correction<00:06:14.280> with<00:06:14.400> still<00:06:14.610> photography<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.270> so

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
correction with still photography and so

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.690 
correction with still photography and so
on<00:06:15.660> this<00:06:16.410> is<00:06:16.620> our<00:06:16.800> workstation<00:06:17.430> machine

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700

on this is our workstation machine
inside<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.060> studio<00:06:18.390> this<00:06:18.540> is<00:06:18.600> what<00:06:18.780> we<00:06:18.870> do<00:06:19.020> 90%

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
inside the studio this is what we do 90%

it's<00:06:24.270> all<00:06:24.540> done<00:06:24.780> with<00:06:24.960> these<00:06:25.080> machines<00:06:25.260> we

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
it's all done with these machines we

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.010 
it's all done with these machines we
have<00:06:26.160> six<00:06:26.850> of<00:06:27.000> these<00:06:27.030> in<00:06:27.390> the<00:06:27.480> studio<00:06:27.810> right

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
have six of these in the studio right

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.540 
have six of these in the studio right
now<00:06:28.170> this<00:06:28.500> makes<00:06:28.740> this<00:06:28.920> seven<00:06:29.250> so<00:06:29.400> we<00:06:29.520> have

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
now this makes this seven so we have

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.630 
now this makes this seven so we have
four<00:06:30.450> I<00:06:30.840> think<00:06:31.470> we<00:06:31.620> have<00:06:31.710> forty<00:06:32.160> seventy<00:06:32.460> five

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
four I think we have forty seventy five

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.570 
four I think we have forty seventy five
are<00:06:33.000> now<00:06:33.150> forty<00:06:33.540> 74<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.110> we<00:06:34.230> have<00:06:34.350> two<00:06:34.650> g73<00:06:35.310> s

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
are now forty 74 is we have two g73 s

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.880 
are now forty 74 is we have two g73 s
and<00:06:35.790> now<00:06:36.270> we<00:06:36.330> have<00:06:36.570> our<00:06:36.780> first<00:06:37.020> G<00:06:37.230> 75<00:06:37.710> which

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
and now we have our first G 75 which

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.040 
and now we have our first G 75 which
just<00:06:38.130> barely<00:06:38.280> came<00:06:38.580> it's<00:06:39.240> a<00:06:39.330> wonderful<00:06:39.750> unit

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
just barely came it's a wonderful unit
