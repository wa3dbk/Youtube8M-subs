three-pronged attack number one is the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.179 
three-pronged attack number one is the

we<00:00:27.240> know<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> overload<00:00:28.050> principle<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
we know that the overload principle is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.529 
we know that the overload principle is
the<00:00:28.619> number<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.429> grow<00:00:29.880> muscle<00:00:30.119> and

releasing growth hormones which are

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
releasing growth hormones which are
great<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.790> burning<00:00:42.570> fat<00:00:42.600> while<00:00:43.079> you're

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
great for burning fat while you're

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
great for burning fat while you're
building<00:00:43.530> muscle<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.219> finally<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> after

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
building muscle and finally the after

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.670 
building muscle and finally the after
burn<00:00:45.329> effect<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:46.230> using<00:00:46.440> these

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
burn effect we're using these

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
burn effect we're using these
high-intensity<00:00:47.370> workouts<00:00:47.820> where<00:00:48.000> short

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
high-intensity workouts where short

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
high-intensity workouts where short
period<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.660> forcing<00:00:49.559> our<00:00:49.680> body<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
period of time forcing our body into the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
period of time forcing our body into the
after<00:00:50.670> burn<00:00:50.820> effect<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.510> again<00:00:51.780> jacks<00:00:52.260> up

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
after burn effect which again jacks up

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
after burn effect which again jacks up
that<00:00:52.649> metabolism<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.059> only

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that metabolism so now you're not only

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
that metabolism so now you're not only
built<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> burning<00:00:55.289> fat<00:00:55.469> during<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> workout

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
built a burning fat during that workout

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
built a burning fat during that workout
with<00:00:56.730> 36<00:00:57.180> hours<00:00:57.420> after<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.870> right<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.199> that's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
with 36 hours after all right so that's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
with 36 hours after all right so that's
reformed<00:00:58.980> attack<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.730> m3<00:01:00.059> approach<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
reformed attack the m3 approach this is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.660

and<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.140> capitalize<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and we're gonna capitalize on the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
and we're gonna capitalize on the
afterburn<00:01:35.909> effect<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.720> help<00:01:36.990> you
