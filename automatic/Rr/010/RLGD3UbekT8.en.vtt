00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.250
 this entourage knights start bloody

 people and animals to humanity in this 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.240
 the war was a long time but technological 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.229
 revolution gives the knight a chance to reverse 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.929
 the course of history is in this third binding 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.450
 the rebel side they want as usual 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.050
 give the land to the peasants of the factory workers 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 send the queen to the scaffold and know with 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 who have been contacted 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 tell more about the history of the order barely 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.380
 Do you get a single plot 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.010
 turn is revealed in the first few minutes 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.780
 games 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 and the rest of the time the character 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 do that with an important face 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 say stupid things are true authors 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.230
 orders for some reason decided to imitate heavy 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.300
 rain and spent half of eight 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.160
 hours of play on slightly interactive 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 videos and scenes where the hero can only 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.990
 walk watch and listen 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.830
 the problem is that the dialogues and the whole 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.480
 game script 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 only suitable for thrash film 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.160
 american werewolf in london only 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.900
 for some reason this film lasts three times longer 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:09.020
 half-breed, they are on the roof 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.940
 hospitals need to disperse them quickly 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.770
 the universe of the order is promising but in 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.440
 almost nothing about the game 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.750
 tell even gathering and listening to all 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 wax rolls with notes you feel 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.490
 an acute lack of at least some 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 information about the world and the past 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.930
 heroes give scraps of useful information 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.030
 that the game is still underlined 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.310
 the authors seem to be from wikipedia nikola 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.380
 Tesla do not like Edison in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 the royal archive is the letter of Charles 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.520
 Darwin and on the working district white read 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.160
 jack the ripper walks 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.760
 that's all that the order is able to inform 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:55.410
 us about the Victorian era about and how 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:57.989
 there is your friend odessa doing 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.570
 amazing that it is quite possible 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.730
 after all live alternative london 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.580
 the end of the nineteenth century looks 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.800
 just awesome order the first game 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.020
 which is in full force show on 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.690
 what is capable of a new generation of consoles 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.330
 every frame of every animation every 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.250
 london alley lanterns just a piece 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.630
 parketoff of buildings looks like that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.630
 I want to marry them 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.510
 all the latest technology here 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.379
 used strictly on business to create 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.140
 desired atmosphere 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.209
 no paris from assassin's creed unity 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.590
 do not match the beauty of the deceased 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.230
 London gateways 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.299
 and the interiors of cheap brothels this game 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.790
 it won't work on youtube because 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.739
 the main thing in the order is a sense of presence in 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.720
 a world that you don't feel during 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.819
 watching a live video so if 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 do you have a big tv or 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.420
 projector 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.930
 and also good acoustics you know which 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.000
 you should try the game especially as 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.430
 gameplay in the order is not particularly 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.980
 distracts from visual enjoyment 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.410
 let's say he just is here always 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.720
 it is clear from where to go what to do and in whom 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.410
 shoot an open world no but it 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.960
 only plus 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.360
 even a man can settle in the order 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.180
 who first see playstation 4 and 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.900
 be sure to get the mass from the game 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.900
 pleasures and how you like everything 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 quite 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.080
 there are also positional shootouts in 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.480
 the spirit of gears of war 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.170
 tesla's fantastic weapon 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.180
 spy raids under cover of night and 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.930
 epic scenes like storming soaring 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.390
 over london 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.520
 the airship is nothing cardinally new and 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.270
 breakthrough but again very very 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.270
 beautiful 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.590
 order will never become the game of the year for 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.419
 that he is too uneven simple you 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.020
 have a great evening with him 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.210
 of the company 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.460
 but hardly remember this game already through 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740
 week after passing actually 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.620
 the only reason to buy an order 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.240
 right now it's a hot love for old 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.520
 good england from charles novels 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.680
 dickens high cylinder and on by 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.620
 the machine itself is such a london 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.630
 you will not be shown anywhere else but all 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.060
 the rest can calmly wait 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.850
 big discounts or continued on 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.440
 which hints the ending in it the authors 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.900
 should do everything right 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.229
 especially if you do not forget to change 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:46.710
 screenwriter is not the end of this 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.710
 you can be sure
