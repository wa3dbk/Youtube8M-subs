00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
I guess Milan is from a very far away

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.990 
I guess Milan is from a very far away
time<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.870> she<00:02:36.110> wants<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.950> bring<00:02:37.430> honor<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.850> a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.280 
time and she wants to bring honor to a

okay oh yes oh I love you it's obvious
that<00:03:34.530> they<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:35.099> each<00:03:35.280> other<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.900> they're

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
that they like each other but they're

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.990 
that they like each other but they're
not<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.920> they're<00:03:38.280> not<00:03:38.430> entirely

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
not that they're not entirely

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.729

comfortable<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.840> telling<00:03:40.170> each<00:03:40.439> other<00:03:40.590> that

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
comfortable with telling each other that

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.710

most<00:03:42.900> obvious<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:44.069> my<00:03:44.370> chemistry<00:03:44.909> Mulan<00:03:45.569> is

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
most obvious with my chemistry Mulan is

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.170 
most obvious with my chemistry Mulan is
