my bets I
I<00:03:00.940> don't<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.960> just<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.620> things

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
I don't know it just it just things

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.700 
I don't know it just it just things
we're<00:03:03.220> not<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.580> my<00:03:03.790> way<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.270> don't<00:03:04.540> know

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
we're not going my way I don't know

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.590 
we're not going my way I don't know
maybe<00:03:05.710> I'm<00:03:05.860> not<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> lucky<00:03:06.610> person<00:03:06.820> maybe<00:03:07.390> it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
maybe I'm not a lucky person maybe it's

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.750 
maybe I'm not a lucky person maybe it's
not<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.900> my<00:03:08.020> blood<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.740> was<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.310> losing

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
not in my blood I was just losing

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.690 
not in my blood I was just losing
everything<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.320> one<00:03:11.380> game<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.520> was

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
everything and then this one game it was

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.190 
everything and then this one game it was
a<00:03:12.730> cloud<00:03:13.390> nine<00:03:13.950> versus<00:03:14.950> Titan<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.870> my

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
a cloud nine versus Titan and in my

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.510 
a cloud nine versus Titan and in my
opinion<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:18.220> game<00:03:18.550> was<00:03:19.000> more<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:20.520> 50-50

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
opinion that game was more of a 50-50

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.940 
opinion that game was more of a 50-50
soul<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.270> impossible<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.840> predict<00:03:23.290> how

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
soul it's impossible to predict how

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.310 
soul it's impossible to predict how
especially<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.030> best<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.420> one<00:03:25.600> game<00:03:25.840> it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
especially on a best of one game it's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.070 
especially on a best of one game it's
impossible<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.980> predict<00:03:27.490> which<00:03:28.330> team<00:03:28.810> is

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
impossible to predict which team is

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.200 
impossible to predict which team is
actually<00:03:30.040> going<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.430> win<00:03:30.610> like<00:03:30.880> it's<00:03:31.120> just

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually going to win like it's just

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.320 
actually going to win like it's just
it's<00:03:31.960> almost<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.560> random<00:03:32.980> choice<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:34.120> since

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's almost a random choice but since

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.960 
it's almost a random choice but since
the<00:03:34.570> odds<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:35.530> Titan<00:03:36.250> were<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.520> favorite

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
the odds because Titan were the favorite

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.690 
the odds because Titan were the favorite
team<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:38.050> odds<00:03:38.290> were<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.190> believe<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.610> was

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
team the odds were like I believe it was

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.730 
team the odds were like I believe it was
like<00:03:39.910> 69<00:03:40.450> 31<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.380> 31<00:03:42.100> for<00:03:42.870> cloud<00:03:43.870> nine<00:03:44.380> I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
like 69 31 and 31 for cloud nine I

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.980 
like 69 31 and 31 for cloud nine I
decided<00:03:45.250> no<00:03:45.550> I'm<00:03:45.880> gonna<00:03:46.090> put<00:03:46.300> my<00:03:46.420> faith<00:03:46.720> on

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
the bat on the screen basically I bets I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.420 
the bat on the screen basically I bets I
think<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.030> was<00:04:01.120> shit<00:04:01.420> worth<00:04:01.690> around<00:04:02.500> 40<00:04:03.190> bucks

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
think it was shit worth around 40 bucks

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.730 
think it was shit worth around 40 bucks
and<00:04:03.700> my<00:04:04.690> potential<00:04:05.200> winnings<00:04:05.770> Oh<00:04:07.740> split

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
and my potential winnings Oh split

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.450 
and my potential winnings Oh split
quadfeed<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.460> that's<00:04:09.850> about<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.180> again<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:10.870> I

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
quadfeed and that's about it again so I

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.580 
quadfeed and that's about it again so I
bet<00:04:12.460> that<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:13.060> my<00:04:13.300> return<00:04:13.720> value<00:04:14.200> if<00:04:14.350> I

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
bet that and my return value if I

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.830 
bet that and my return value if I
actually<00:04:14.770> won<00:04:15.420> was<00:04:16.420> going<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.930> be<00:04:17.910> 104<00:04:18.910> or<00:04:19.180> 103

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
actually won was going to be 104 or 103

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.780 
actually won was going to be 104 or 103
I<00:04:20.140> don't<00:04:20.380> really<00:04:20.500> remember<00:04:20.590> because<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.640> odds

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
I don't really remember because the odds

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.220 
I don't really remember because the odds
were<00:04:22.060> kind<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.360> changing<00:04:22.750> but<00:04:22.900> they<00:04:23.050> are

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
were kind of changing but they are

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.530 
were kind of changing but they are
always<00:04:24.070> around<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.490> same<00:04:24.700> number<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
always around the same number so the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.870 
always around the same number so the
match<00:04:25.780> starts<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:27.280> case<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.580> don't<00:04:27.730> know

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
match starts and in case you don't know

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.930 
match starts and in case you don't know
it's<00:04:28.390> basically<00:04:29.200> Search<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.220> Destroy<00:04:30.250> style

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
it's basically Search and Destroy style

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.620 
it's basically Search and Destroy style
30<00:04:31.870> rounds<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:32.950> first<00:04:33.370> team<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.700> get<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.030> 16

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
30 rounds so the first team to get to 16

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.100 
30 rounds so the first team to get to 16
rounds<00:04:35.170> wins<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.880> it's<00:04:37.420> like<00:04:37.630> 15

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
rounds wins right and it's like 15

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.260 
rounds wins right and it's like 15
rounds<00:04:38.530> at<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.950> defensive<00:04:39.520> side<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:39.790> then

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
rounds at in the defensive side and then

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.380 
rounds at in the defensive side and then
15<00:04:41.020> wrong<00:04:41.200> on<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.530> offensive<00:04:42.010> side<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.730> all<00:04:42.970> i

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
15 wrong on the offensive side and all i

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.420 
15 wrong on the offensive side and all i
have<00:04:43.420> to<00:04:43.600> say<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.020> at<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> end<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:45.070> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
have to say is that at the end of the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.920 
have to say is that at the end of the
first<00:04:45.730> rounds<00:04:46.480> it<00:04:46.810> was<00:04:47.800> 11<00:04:48.460> for<00:04:48.790> for<00:04:49.270> titan<00:04:49.690> so

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
first rounds it was 11 for for titan so

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.840 
first rounds it was 11 for for titan so
