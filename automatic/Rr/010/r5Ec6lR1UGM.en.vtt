experiences<00:01:57.690> with<00:01:57.750> putting<00:01:58.560> baby<00:01:58.800> powders<00:01:59.250> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
experiences with putting baby powders so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.150 
experiences with putting baby powders so
if<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.110> too<00:02:01.290> shiny<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.680> pretty<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
if it's too shiny I pretty much just

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.130 
if it's too shiny I pretty much just
throw<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> back<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> closet<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
throw it in the back of the closet if I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.500 
throw it in the back of the closet if I
can't<00:02:04.380> return<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:22.610 

okay<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.110> regular

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
okay so this is it and it's a regular

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:35.740 
okay so this is it and it's a regular
cap<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.250> got<00:02:23.459> no<00:02:23.819> combs<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:25.010> no<00:02:26.010> lace

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.420 

so<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.260> hairline<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:38.900> ends<00:02:40.430> no

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
so this is the hairline just ends no

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.930 
so this is the hairline just ends no
lace

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.420 

so<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.690> hair<00:02:45.900> has<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.320> be<00:02:46.350> worn<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> front

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so the hair has to be worn to the front

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.630 
so the hair has to be worn to the front
you<00:02:47.670> can't<00:02:47.940> really<00:02:48.180> wear<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.900> hair<00:02:49.170> back

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
you can't really wear the hair back

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.360 
you can't really wear the hair back
without<00:02:50.640> having<00:02:51.060> some<00:02:51.450> hair<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> front

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.920 

it's<00:02:56.370> kind<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.730> thin<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.420> thin<00:02:57.810> side<00:02:58.010> I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's kind of thin on the thin side I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.970 
it's kind of thin on the thin side I
photographed<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> inside<00:03:01.500> out<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
photographed it inside out and when you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.010 
photographed it inside out and when you
see<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> wig<00:03:05.700> inside<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
see a wig inside out and you see that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.400 
see a wig inside out and you see that
the<00:03:07.200> tracks<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.860> pretty<00:03:08.640> far<00:03:08.910> apart<00:03:09.230> that's<00:03:10.230> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the tracks are pretty far apart that's a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.360 
the tracks are pretty far apart that's a
sign<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.890> thin

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.759 

it's<00:03:17.090> one<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.420> those<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769

it's one of those and it is not the
Torah<00:03:19.510> which<00:03:20.510> explains<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.230> shine<00:03:22.629> but<00:03:23.629> my
