00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.460
 after a long break there is now 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.810
 finally news was the break again 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.670
 owed to the reason that I get sick 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.410
 In reality, I just had to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.180
 play away I am now doing that 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.099
 in principle the only news this one 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.200
 So it was that with the week 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.990
 video thanks for watching and we see 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.040
 us next time 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.840
 no, of course, there are also important ones 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.029
 news especially the exchange banks of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.849
 Company lc's teams are really warm 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.529
 We have become known as some teams 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.360
 and I'll just give you that one now 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.270
 enumerate as is it we have team there 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 liquid the sarah have the caribbean 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.000
 with the in this 300 with sk telecom 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.429
 there was a replacement for him 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.230
 will be kinect letter that has in the 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.329
 first couple of played by as 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.800
 pitt still this problem has there 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.870
 also pretty good actually performs 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850
 but if you look up to this champion 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.710
 we this player with the champions 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.089
 league quali compares then that is 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.679
 actually other caliber there 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.940
 nonetheless has met nonetheless 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.739
 the management for this player 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.390
 decided and must also say so 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.030
 even with pee has not lies 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.250
 best performance had gone with 20 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.810
 and maybe even the right one 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.220
 decision was elements has become something 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.990
 actually done something and indeed 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.880
 was the top favorite of the already 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.979
 for weeks in the crossfire of the community 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.930
 ultimately stands by ours 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.060
 colleagues kevin continues the management has 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.250
 So decided to come here 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.049
 as a substitute to pick says as a core problem 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.090
 many of them agree with everyone 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.920
 case to others say it's the teamplay 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.000
 the Scot colin too passive 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.579
 by far, I'm definitely 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.500
 curious he is from now on so to speak 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.700
 already today for elements the topline 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.070
 I'm definitely clean 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.640
 curious if that the desired successes 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.020
 will bring 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.399
 if we take a quick look 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.340
 we have another design 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.750
 rosstat teamcoach it 's the last one 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 season norbert sk gaming at the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.590
 newell's has not participated 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.340
 the more starter with countries for team 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.710
 be costly 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.509
 now it will be macleod macleod has 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.189
 previously played under lcs and it 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.200
 was there for the team clouds as well 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.789
 in the world participated so to speak 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.130
 only as a player for the player 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.750
 I am not sure if this is exchanged 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.789
 will bring the desired results 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.710
 Costa has other problems with you 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.509
 should be approached anyway it was 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.340
 Definitely one of them with the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.260
 monster changes the challenger studios 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.970
 has now begun in the position 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220
 It is about the best 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.310
 teams are trying for the lcs too 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.020
 qualify to do that now 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880
 a slightly different format and that 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.099
 There are six teams per region in the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.530
 play each other for five weeks against each other 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.910
 Team play twice against each team 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.130
 at the end of ten games completed 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.110
 that's why in five weeks every two weeks 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.670
 games find the wednesday and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.590
 thursday instead of and one of the games 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.269
 will always be born so costs 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.150
 as I was the case on Wednesday 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.099
 in the eu we had the matchups reason 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.420
 gaming against mousesports ex developed 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.610
 the there has reasonable gaming 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 enforced in the next match whether origin 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.510
 against gamers to could origin 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 prevail victoriously and in the last 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.330
 match up by dignitas eu against rewarding 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.489
 lions had to be so European 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.040
 line up beaten by dignitas 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.110
 and lorenz lions moves in with a team 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.940
 The next week almost like that 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.530
 whole of the fc still needed if costs 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.239
 you're so bent on the challenge therefore 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.980
 You should go on Thursdays from time to time 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.870
 stop by our channel because there 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.519
 is it then in any case the one 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 or other times yes that is to be seen 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.049
 Finally, give one for many 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.090
 enjoyable for others rather sad 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.700
 message and indeed the original rock of the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.739
 sports big lot is now officially out 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.329
 the post resigned he will now 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.400
 no more than per player 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.500
 or the challengers julius try 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.299
 an officer a spot at gamers 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.549
 do give up and become now 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.920
 complete his business so the team 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.569
 gamers tu and the brand devote to it 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.400
 as already indicated that one rather 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.690
 controversial personality some love 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.709
 others hate him but I believe 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.609
 Nobody can succeed 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.170
 deny 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.090
 this is definitely an era 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.030
 end and it is definitely one of 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.280
 people who sports the e in the early days 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.329
 That's the thing that's most influenced by days 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.410
 with the news this week I hope so 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.670
 has fallen to you as always 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.670
 See you next time
