going through all the local parameters I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.439 
going through all the local parameters I
can<00:00:29.490> run<00:00:29.730> through<00:00:29.880> them<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.210> quickly

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
can run through them really quickly

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
we can change that to centimeters

say maybe four inches he's a little bit

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.219 
say maybe four inches he's a little bit
larger<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:02.309> scale<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> print<00:01:03.719> volume<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
larger or scale to print volume and it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
larger or scale to print volume and it
will<00:01:04.320> automatically<00:01:04.920> choose<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> maximum

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
will automatically choose the maximum

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
will automatically choose the maximum
height<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.810> width<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.979> depth<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> need

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
height or width or depth that you need

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.750 
height or width or depth that you need
to<00:01:09.000> fill<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> space<00:01:10.100> support<00:01:11.100> structures<00:01:11.549> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to fill that space support structures in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
to fill that space support structures in
this<00:01:11.850> case<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.299> printing<00:01:12.600> locally<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.740> my

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this case I'm printing locally so on my

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.160 
this case I'm printing locally so on my
printer<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.970> choose<00:01:15.150> scaffolding<00:01:15.900> which

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
printer I would choose scaffolding which

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
printer I would choose scaffolding which
builds<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:17.130> array<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> scaffolds<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
builds an array of scaffolds and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.330 
builds an array of scaffolds and
supports<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.920> print<00:01:20.220> these

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
supports so that you can print these

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.920 
supports so that you can print these
things<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.450> middle<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> space

things that are in the middle of space
here<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:23.400> choose<00:01:23.580> raft<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
here you can choose raft as well if you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
here you can choose raft as well if you
want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> print<00:01:25.799> something<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.549> think

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
want to print something that you think

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.390 
want to print something that you think
may<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.180> additional<00:01:27.450> support<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.220> now

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
may need additional support so right now

there<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> possibility<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.899> estimate<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
there is a possibility to estimate the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
there is a possibility to estimate the
price<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.720> I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:45.960> ahead

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
price as well and I'm going to go ahead

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
price as well and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:46.229> choose<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.009> gonna<00:01:47.130> build<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and choose that and it's gonna build the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050 
and choose that and it's gonna build the

model we're very quickly here and give

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
model we're very quickly here and give
us<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.659> estimate<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.649> these<00:01:52.860> prices

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
us a an estimate of what these prices

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
us a an estimate of what these prices
might<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.090> prices<00:01:54.420> fluctuate

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
might be and as prices fluctuate

might be and as prices fluctuate
constantly<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> markets<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:57.180> try<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> get

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
constantly in the markets we try to get

constantly in the markets we try to get
within<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> few<00:01:58.469> percentages<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
within you know a few percentages of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
within you know a few percentages of
what<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> act<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:00.840> might<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:00.990> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
what is act what it actually might be so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
what is act what it actually might be so
if<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.710> off<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.159> by<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> couple<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
if it's off you know by a couple of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
if it's off you know by a couple of
nickels<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> shouldn't<00:02:04.829> be

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
nickels and it you know it shouldn't be

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.550 
nickels and it you know it shouldn't be
that<00:02:05.009> big<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> hit<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.299> case<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> loom

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that big a hit in this case for a loom

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
that big a hit in this case for a loom
I'd<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> gonna<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.129> three<00:02:08.280> hundred<00:02:08.550> forty<00:02:08.819> four

dollars and some of these things will be

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.710 
dollars and some of these things will be
shocking<00:02:11.520> at<00:02:11.640> first<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> start<00:02:12.300> looking

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
shocking at first when you start looking

at some of these number

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.310 
at some of these number
you<00:02:13.740> know<00:02:13.890> full-color<00:02:14.400> sandstone<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.320> $149

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
you know full-color sandstone is $149

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.090 
you know full-color sandstone is $149
and<00:02:17.190> if<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.430> choose<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:19.440> example<00:02:19.890> let's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and if I choose that for example let's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.820 
and if I choose that for example let's
go<00:02:20.160> ahead<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.490> choose<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.820> one<00:02:21.710> it's<00:02:22.710> gonna

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
go ahead and choose that one it's gonna

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.590 
go ahead and choose that one it's gonna
give<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.190> full<00:02:23.370> color<00:02:23.700> look<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.450> model

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
give me the full color look of the model

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.150 
give me the full color look of the model
it'll<00:02:24.930> retain<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.380> textures<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> things

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
it'll retain the textures and things

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.340 
it'll retain the textures and things
like<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.610> these<00:02:27.210> other<00:02:27.510> materials<00:02:28.110> or

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
like that these other materials or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.410 
like that these other materials or
single<00:02:28.740> materials<00:02:29.280> they're<00:02:29.430> single<00:02:30.030> colors

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
single materials they're single colors

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.449 
single materials they're single colors
and<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.440> case<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.100> polished

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and in this case this is a polished

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.320 
and in this case this is a polished
nickel<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.470> raw<00:02:34.470> silver<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.060> change

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
nickel and raw silver and if I change

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
nickel and raw silver and if I change
the<00:02:36.480> size<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.020> model<00:02:37.410> it'll<00:02:37.709> reach<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the size of this model it'll reach it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.440 
the size of this model it'll reach it
we'll<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.459> recalculate<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.330> have

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
we'll have to recalculate that you have

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.790 
we'll have to recalculate that you have
to<00:02:39.510> go<00:02:39.630> through<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.870> process<00:02:40.020> again

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
to go through that process again

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.770 
to go through that process again
now<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:41.550> automatically<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.330> I'm<00:02:42.630> gonna

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
now we automatically do that I'm gonna

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.520 
now we automatically do that I'm gonna
go<00:02:42.900> ahead<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.350> say<00:02:44.300> full<00:02:45.300> color<00:02:45.600> sandstone

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
go ahead and say full color sandstone

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.180 
go ahead and say full color sandstone
and<00:02:48.140> walk<00:02:49.140> through<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.380> process<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:50.010> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and walk through the process here and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.410 
and walk through the process here and
then<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.580> click<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
then I'm going to click here this is a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.500 
then I'm going to click here this is a
icon<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.230> say<00:02:52.380> start<00:02:52.770> print<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:54.360> gonna

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
icon to say start print and it's gonna

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.300 
icon to say start print and it's gonna
do<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> same<00:02:55.140> thing<00:02:55.200> basically<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.130> did

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
do the same thing basically it did

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.160 
do the same thing basically it did
earlier<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.020> got<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
earlier but this you know it's got to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.860 
earlier but this you know it's got to
repair<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.739> model<00:02:59.040> fix<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> holes<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.060> do

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
repair the model fix the holes and do

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.850 
repair the model fix the holes and do
all<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> things<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.380> needs<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.770> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
all the things that needs to do to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.729 
all the things that needs to do to
prepare<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.550> 3d<00:03:02.880> printer<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.739> when

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
prepare it for a 3d printer and when

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.900 
prepare it for a 3d printer and when
it's<00:03:04.890> done<00:03:05.100> we'll<00:03:05.459> go<00:03:05.550> ahead<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.790> walk

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
it's done we'll go ahead and walk

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310 
it's done we'll go ahead and walk
through<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> process<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.110> shape

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
through the process of going to shape

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.010 
through the process of going to shape
ways<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.100> here<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.370> go<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.940> guess<00:03:09.870> of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
ways so here we go this is a guess of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.300 
ways so here we go this is a guess of
what<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:10.320> look<00:03:10.380> like<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.070> pretty

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
what it will look like it's a pretty

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520 
what it will look like it's a pretty
good<00:03:11.670> approximation<00:03:11.910> as<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> geometry<00:03:12.900> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
good approximation as the geometry and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.070 
good approximation as the geometry and
it's<00:03:14.780> $163<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> size<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:19.049> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
it's $163 this is the size and I think I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.449 
it's $163 this is the size and I think I

really cool I like that very clever so
now<00:04:07.069> when<00:04:07.400> we're<00:04:07.519> at<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.670> shapeways<00:04:08.180> site<00:04:08.480> is

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
now when we're at the shapeways site is

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.170 
now when we're at the shapeways site is
going<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.930> generate<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:09.650> thumbnail<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.700> what<00:04:11.090> it

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
going to generate a thumbnail of what it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.720 
going to generate a thumbnail of what it
is<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.629> it's<00:04:11.840> gonna<00:04:11.959> start<00:04:12.260> checking<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
is and it's gonna start checking the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.550 
is and it's gonna start checking the
print<00:04:14.090> ability<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.540> this<00:04:14.659> model<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.140> little<00:04:15.439> bit

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
print ability of this model a little bit

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.979 
print ability of this model a little bit
here<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:15.980> give<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.340> more<00:04:17.299> estimates<00:04:17.870> now

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
here and give you more estimates now

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.479 
here and give you more estimates now
these<00:04:18.139> estimates<00:04:18.709> should<00:04:18.979> be<00:04:19.100> pretty<00:04:19.370> much

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
these estimates should be pretty much

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.370 
these estimates should be pretty much
spot-on<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:20.150> you're<00:04:20.269> gonna<00:04:20.389> get<00:04:20.660> okay

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
spot-on of what you're gonna get okay

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.240 
spot-on of what you're gonna get okay
and<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.110> point<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.740> actually<00:04:24.830> order

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
and at that point you can actually order

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.430 
and at that point you can actually order
it<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.669> can<00:04:25.820> update<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.660> file<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.259> think

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
