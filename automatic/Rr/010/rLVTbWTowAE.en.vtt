00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
actually got the 32 gig but 16 gigabytes

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
actually got the 32 gig but 16 gigabytes
is<00:01:31.200> still<00:01:31.500> decent<00:01:31.860> amount<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> space<00:01:32.520> i'm

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is still decent amount of space i'm

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.469 
is still decent amount of space i'm
nowhere<00:01:32.939> near<00:01:33.259> full<00:01:34.259> i<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:35.479> 10

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
nowhere near full i still have 10

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
nowhere near full i still have 10
gigabytes<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> space<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.540> only<00:01:40.290> using<00:01:40.950> two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
gigabytes of space to go only using two

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.740 
gigabytes of space to go only using two
gigs<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:43.790> don't<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.149> anything<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
gigs so i don't have really anything to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
gigs so i don't have really anything to
worry<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.619> pretty<00:01:46.860> cool

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
worry about but that's a pretty cool

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.830 
worry about but that's a pretty cool
thing<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.909> expanded<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
thing that they have expanded the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
thing that they have expanded the
storage<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.380> nexus<00:01:52.950> 7<00:01:53.310> actually

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
storage because the nexus 7 actually

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
storage because the nexus 7 actually
lacks<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.390> storage<00:01:54.869> especially<00:01:55.530> since

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
lacks a little storage especially since

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.749 
lacks a little storage especially since
it<00:01:55.890> doesn't<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.340> any<00:01:56.579> micro<00:01:57.060> SD<00:01:57.509> slots<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
it doesn't have any micro SD slots in it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.219 
it doesn't have any micro SD slots in it
