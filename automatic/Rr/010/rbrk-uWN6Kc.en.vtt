the<00:04:01.900> original<00:04:02.500> URL<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.490> now<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.820> dead<00:04:04.240> link<00:04:06.210> so

the original URL is now a dead link so

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.730 
the original URL is now a dead link so

in this big coronal crack the dark spot

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:09.170 
in this big coronal crack the dark spot
a<00:06:00.630> huge<00:06:01.440> dark<00:06:01.830> area<00:06:03.980> they<00:06:07.910> scrubbed<00:06:08.910> out<00:06:09.120> a

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
a huge dark area they scrubbed out a

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
a huge dark area they scrubbed out a
whole<00:06:09.570> bunch<00:06:09.870> of<00:06:10.550> dark<00:06:11.550> circular<00:06:12.120> or<00:06:12.780> black

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
whole bunch of dark circular or black

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.310 
whole bunch of dark circular or black
objects<00:06:14.060> from<00:06:15.060> that<00:06:15.390> area<00:06:15.720> and<00:06:17.000> they<00:06:18.000> also

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
objects from that area and they also

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.520 
objects from that area and they also
scrubbed<00:06:19.320> out<00:06:19.560> an<00:06:19.860> object<00:06:20.780> down<00:06:21.780> by<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.110> five

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
scrubbed out an object down by the five

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.770 
scrubbed out an object down by the five
o'clock<00:06:22.920> position<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:29.300> corona<00:06:30.300> on<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
o'clock position and the corona on the

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.000 
o'clock position and the corona on the
side<00:06:31.080> there<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:32.750> they<00:06:33.750> changed<00:06:34.110> that<00:06:34.560> twelve

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
side there and they changed that twelve

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:45.290 
side there and they changed that twelve
o'clock<00:06:35.460> object<00:06:36.090> as<00:06:36.300> well

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.719 

so<00:06:45.870> this<00:06:46.080> is<00:06:46.259> the<00:06:46.470> original<00:06:46.620> see<00:06:47.340> all<00:06:47.520> those

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
so this is the original see all those

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.659 
so this is the original see all those
dark<00:06:48.120> or<00:06:48.539> black<00:06:48.930> objects<00:06:50.599> in<00:06:51.599> there<00:06:52.340> well<00:06:53.340> they

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
dark or black objects in there well they

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:01.070 
dark or black objects in there well they
scrubbed<00:06:54.180> all<00:06:54.419> them<00:06:54.720> out<00:06:58.970> all<00:06:59.970> those<00:07:00.569> dark

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
scrubbed all them out all those dark

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.980 
scrubbed all them out all those dark
circle<00:07:01.800> or<00:07:02.099> black<00:07:02.490> objects<00:07:03.180> they<00:07:03.419> scrubbed

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
circle or black objects they scrubbed

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.869 
circle or black objects they scrubbed
out<00:07:05.810> they<00:07:06.810> scrubbed<00:07:07.349> out<00:07:07.560> that<00:07:07.949> object<00:07:08.610> right

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 
out they scrubbed out that object right

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:17.460 
out they scrubbed out that object right
there

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.160 

and<00:07:17.920> this<00:07:18.250> scrubbed<00:07:18.790> out<00:07:19.060> da<00:07:19.360> right<00:07:19.690> there<00:07:19.930> so

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.170 
and this scrubbed out da right there so

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.690 
and this scrubbed out da right there so
that's<00:07:20.380> what<00:07:20.590> it<00:07:20.620> looked<00:07:20.980> like<00:07:21.130> in<00:07:21.250> the

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 
that's what it looked like in the

the brightness or anything that's what

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.990 
the brightness or anything that's what
it<00:07:27.460> looked<00:07:27.700> like<00:07:27.790> right<00:07:28.270> there<00:07:29.520> but<00:07:30.520> when<00:07:30.820> you

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
it looked like right there but when you

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.930 
it looked like right there but when you
zoomed<00:07:31.390> in<00:07:31.780> on<00:07:31.840> it<00:07:32.350> and<00:07:32.730> adjusted<00:07:33.730> the

zoomed in on it and adjusted the

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.080 
zoomed in on it and adjusted the
brightness<00:07:33.970> and<00:07:34.840> contrast<00:07:35.550> that's<00:07:36.550> how<00:07:36.820> I<00:07:36.850> was

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
brightness and contrast that's how I was

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:49.560 
brightness and contrast that's how I was
