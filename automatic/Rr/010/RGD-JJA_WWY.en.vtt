00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 I love Rotterdam and the Rotterdam harbor is a beautiful place 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.100
 but venice has it either 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.240
 I have a great honor to take a look at the cycling track 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.960
 new artwork from gaal she is almost ready to be called and you that 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.070
 Queen Beatrix 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.829
 and I'm going to watch 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.310
 the leftist hobbyists 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.310
 you have the whole day inside 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.880
 6 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 we have in sight 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.160
 only animals built that is it is the largest ship in the holland 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.820
 america line at the moment 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 and that is also the largest ship ever under in the history of the Netherlands 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.570
 the Dutch flag 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 in something is then the citizens themselves find out why beautiful views this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.520
 is it is a nice boost this is my strong board in which it is the ship 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.700
 probo 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.309
 and with so many months being the first place during the day with the three men 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.070
 an officer and 2 great masters given that so few people work 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 maybe so much space 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 bouterse of course, equipment will be a big social to make everything right 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.930
 to be able to keep an eye on, we just need the chance to win twice 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.170
 design for the navigation of the ship but also for all safety standards in the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.630
 so they just keep an eye on things 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.780
 the area needed for so much equipment because in which areas often 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.080
 not the division we now start in the Baltic Sea in the halls then come in 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.500
 August arrive 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 and with that rican 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.380
 it is this is a network of the new radar secretary 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.590
 in this case to experience 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 after they ghost 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 the asian restaurants 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 the specialist store 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.690
 the jury and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.690
 in the past not such a big ship to stock 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.410
 one in three weeks 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.200
 Prince Bernard 9 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100
 good for it 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.579
 she thought it was a good thing and some drinks 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:12.959
 and then too 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.419
 7 to 10 days 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.339
 then we get it agree 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.439
 van de Velde 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.830
 for her so that is like fresh fish 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 the fresh vegetables 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.110
 the fast times 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.139
 the work r first the street and that the developer 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.809
 had the new ship and why martens latem 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.109
 along with the reason why it took you an hour to play 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.709
 bouterse because they have the list to watch but that made his employer az 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.009
 gets with that 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:54.799
 we are convinced that it works stronger even a while full of the others 4 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.269
 from 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.799
 8 this is a whole one 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 you send 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.179
 we had more 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:07.889
 this part jac orie 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.909
 why can I imagine that the view on it is different from it 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.199
 girl and also the temperature 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.079

 christengem that was told 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.559
 because they can be found there 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.049
 for the most part of the introduction, he ended up being rotterdam 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 all the greatest of these is again that the queen's baptismal font is directed to us 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 out 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.230
 a pity that I would imagine explaining 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.119
 think of the queen 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.599
