00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of style printing is it's going to come

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.310 
of style printing is it's going to come
out<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:44.540> use<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> different<00:01:45.899> color<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
out here so use a different color to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.929 
out here so use a different color to
show<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> next<00:01:46.799> step<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.790> gonna

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
show you the next step here just gonna

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.990 
show you the next step here just gonna
use<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> pink<00:01:48.329> marker<00:01:48.750> too<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.520> idea<00:01:50.820> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
use a pink marker too and the idea here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.050 
use a pink marker too and the idea here
is<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> draw<00:01:51.540> boxes<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> block<00:01:53.729> letter

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
is you draw boxes to get a block letter

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
is you draw boxes to get a block letter
just<00:01:54.509> boxes<00:01:55.170> blocks<00:01:55.560> around<00:01:56.460> each<00:01:56.790> stroke<00:01:57.619> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
just boxes blocks around each stroke so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
just boxes blocks around each stroke so
you<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> point<00:02:00.930> we're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you just do that and at this point we're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.670 
you just do that and at this point we're
not<00:02:01.229> too<00:02:01.500> worried<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:03.469> intersecting<00:02:04.469> lines

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
not too worried about intersecting lines

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.890 
not too worried about intersecting lines
or<00:02:04.950> anything<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.969> mean

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
or anything like that I mean

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.780 
or anything like that I mean
you<00:02:07.530> could<00:02:07.710> still<00:02:07.980> do<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.399> pencil

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
you could still do this in pencil

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.290 
you could still do this in pencil
ideally<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.440> could<00:02:10.560> erase<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.950> after

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
ideally so that you could erase it after

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.760 
ideally so that you could erase it after
but<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.990> for<00:02:13.230> ease<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:15.230> visibility<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.530> I'm

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
but just for ease of visibility here I'm

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.650 
but just for ease of visibility here I'm
gonna<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.190> doing<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.360> marker<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.660> you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
gonna be doing it in this marker so you

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.270 
gonna be doing it in this marker so you
just<00:02:21.840> draw<00:02:22.410> boxes<00:02:22.880> around<00:02:23.880> each<00:02:24.090> stroke<00:02:24.630> there

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
just draw boxes around each stroke there

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.010 
just draw boxes around each stroke there
like<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.400> said<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.850> put<00:02:26.880> these<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.900> know

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
like I said you can put these you know

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.170 
like I said you can put these you know
intersect<00:02:28.530> they<00:02:28.650> don't<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.180> super

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
intersect they don't have to be super

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.780 
intersect they don't have to be super
clean<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> give<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.790> basic

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
clean this is just to give you the basic

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.240 
clean this is just to give you the basic
kind<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:34.580> outline<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.980> structure<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
kind of outline and structure of the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:51.500 
kind of outline and structure of the
letter<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.770> then<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.850> out

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
letter and then what we do is just out

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.580 
letter and then what we do is just out
on<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.930> whole<00:02:52.170> thing<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.959> get<00:02:55.110> our<00:02:55.260> final

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
on the whole thing to get our final

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.059 
on the whole thing to get our final
letter<00:02:56.160> structure

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.360 

so<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.280> kind<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.550> see<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:05.230> I'll<00:03:06.190> do

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
so you can kind of see that and I'll do

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.460 
so you can kind of see that and I'll do
this<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.550> another<00:03:07.000> color<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.739> full<00:03:09.040> outline

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
this in another color the full outline

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.410 
this in another color the full outline
so<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:12.160> go<00:03:12.489> wrong<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.880> outside

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
so if you just go wrong on the outside

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.320 
so if you just go wrong on the outside
of<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.800> letter<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.459> see<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.120> have

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
of the letter you can see that you have

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.110 
of the letter you can see that you have
a<00:03:16.360> figure<00:03:20.130> sort<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.220> outline<00:03:21.610> of<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.910> letter

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
a figure sort of outline of the letter

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.890 
a figure sort of outline of the letter
the<00:03:23.280> block<00:03:24.280> style<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.239> that's<00:03:25.390> where<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> get

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the block style and that's where you get

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.710 
the block style and that's where you get
that<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.099> said<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:31.300> kind<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.599> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
that and like I said this is kind of the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.259 
that and like I said this is kind of the
foundation<00:03:32.319> for<00:03:32.580> adding<00:03:33.580> other<00:03:33.730> things<00:03:34.060> so

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
foundation for adding other things so

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.690 
foundation for adding other things so
let's<00:03:34.480> say<00:03:34.690> on<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.319> wanted<00:03:35.980> this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
let's say on this a you wanted this

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.280 
let's say on this a you wanted this
crossbar<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.420> come<00:03:37.600> out<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.870> little<00:03:37.989> bit<00:03:38.170> more

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
crossbar to come out a little bit more

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.090 
crossbar to come out a little bit more
so<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.370> could<00:03:39.519> just<00:03:39.700> draw<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.630> as<00:03:41.620> you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
so you could just draw that in as you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.870 
so you could just draw that in as you
outline<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.680> that's<00:03:44.950> where<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.580> get<00:03:45.760> to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
outline it and that's where you get to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.089 
outline it and that's where you get to
experiment<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.690> try<00:03:47.410> different<00:03:47.650> things<00:03:47.830> and

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
experiment and try different things and

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.520 
experiment and try different things and
see<00:03:48.250> what<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.610> like<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.870> what<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.380> think

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
see what you like and see what you think

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.589 
see what you like and see what you think
works<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.010> doesn't<00:03:51.190> work<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.360> could<00:03:52.510> do

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
works and doesn't work like you could do

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.270 
works and doesn't work like you could do
this<00:03:52.750> top<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.019> bunch<00:03:53.349> of<00:03:53.470> different<00:03:53.739> ways<00:03:53.860> see

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
this top a bunch of different ways see

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.100 
this top a bunch of different ways see
how<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.760> intersects<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.510> could<00:03:55.660> go<00:03:55.840> out<00:03:55.959> with

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
how it intersects you could go out with

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.509 
how it intersects you could go out with
that<00:03:56.440> outline<00:03:56.860> there<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:59.099> there's<00:04:00.099> still<00:04:00.340> room

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
that outline there so there's still room

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.089 
that outline there so there's still room
to<00:04:00.760> kind<00:04:01.630> of<00:04:01.780> add<00:04:01.930> your<00:04:02.110> own<00:04:02.200> personal<00:04:02.769> flair

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
to kind of add your own personal flair

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.870 
to kind of add your own personal flair
to<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.280 

so<00:04:09.880> now<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.060> kind<00:04:10.329> of<00:04:10.359> get<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.630> extending

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
so now you kind of get that extending

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.000 
so now you kind of get that extending
bar<00:04:11.950> through<00:04:12.459> there<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.440> looks<00:04:14.440> sloppy<00:04:14.709> now

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
bar through there and looks sloppy now

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.640 
bar through there and looks sloppy now
but<00:04:15.310> if<00:04:16.030> we<00:04:16.209> were<00:04:16.329> just<00:04:16.539> safe<00:04:16.780> filling<00:04:17.470> these

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
but if we were just safe filling these

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.870 
but if we were just safe filling these
letters<00:04:17.979> with<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.280> same<00:04:18.609> pink<00:04:18.940> color<00:04:20.880> then

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
letters with the same pink color then

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.010 
letters with the same pink color then
you'll<00:04:22.780> notice<00:04:23.169> how<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:25.210> really<00:04:25.419> starts<00:04:25.930> to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
you'll notice how it really starts to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.850 
you'll notice how it really starts to
come<00:04:26.110> together

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
come together

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.600 
come together
and<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.820> did<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> pencil<00:04:28.600> if<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.169> were<00:04:29.610> not

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
and if you did it pencil if you were not

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.969 
and if you did it pencil if you were not
wanting<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:32.260> know<00:04:32.380> fill<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
wanting to you know fill it with the

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.070 
wanting to you know fill it with the
same<00:04:33.160> color<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.700> drew<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.120> yeah<00:04:34.330> you

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
same color that you drew it yeah you

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.779 
same color that you drew it yeah you
were<00:04:35.169> just<00:04:35.200> erase<00:04:35.620> these<00:04:35.830> after<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.430> got<00:04:36.580> on

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
were just erase these after you got on

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.159 
were just erase these after you got on
it<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.680> could<00:04:38.889> go<00:04:39.070> through<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:40.169> erase

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
it so you could go through and erase

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.810 
it so you could go through and erase
these<00:04:41.350> lines<00:04:41.410> this<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.310> gonna<00:04:42.430> shake<00:04:42.669> the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
these lines this is gonna shake the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.790 
these lines this is gonna shake the
camera<00:04:43.030> tongue<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:43.780> I'm<00:04:43.990> not<00:04:44.110> gonna<00:04:44.260> go<00:04:44.440> bother

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
camera tongue so I'm not gonna go bother

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.159 
camera tongue so I'm not gonna go bother
with<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.190> I'll<00:04:45.729> just<00:04:46.090> kind<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.389> roughly<00:04:46.810> fill

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
with that I'll just kind of roughly fill

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.110 
with that I'll just kind of roughly fill
this<00:04:47.350> then<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.280> can<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.610> kind<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.880> get<00:04:49.030> an

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
this then so you can just kind of get an

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.470 
this then so you can just kind of get an
idea<00:04:49.210> of

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.570 

looks<00:04:53.480> off<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.930> field<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:55.480> state<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:01.430> this

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
looks off the field and state so this

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.879 
looks off the field and state so this
would<00:05:01.729> work<00:05:01.910> if<00:05:02.150> we<00:05:02.930> were<00:05:03.020> trying<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.350> make

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
would work if we were trying to make

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.920 
would work if we were trying to make
something<00:05:04.160> italic<00:05:04.820> you're<00:05:05.510> just<00:05:05.690> printing

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
something italic you're just printing

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.860 
something italic you're just printing
that<00:05:06.169> italic<00:05:06.710> style<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:08.240> works<00:05:08.419> for<00:05:08.570> bubble

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
that italic style it works for bubble

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.960 
that italic style it works for bubble
letters<00:05:09.169> just<00:05:10.040> draw<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.250> different<00:05:10.490> shape<00:05:10.940> and

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
letters just draw a different shape and

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.629 
letters just draw a different shape and
so<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.570> voxi<00:05:12.050> draw<00:05:12.260> kind<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> more<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:12.889> an<00:05:13.010> oval

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
so the voxi draw kind of more of an oval

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.650 
so the voxi draw kind of more of an oval
shape<00:05:14.979> rounder<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:16.220> then<00:05:17.210> you'll<00:05:17.360> sort<00:05:17.630> of

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
shape rounder and then you'll sort of

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.710 
shape rounder and then you'll sort of
get<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> same<00:05:18.080> effect<00:05:18.470> kind<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.460> bubbly<00:05:19.880> fat

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
get the same effect kind of a bubbly fat

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.820 
get the same effect kind of a bubbly fat
letter<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:26.330> it's<00:05:26.450> just<00:05:26.630> real<00:05:26.900> quick<00:05:27.200> filling

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
letter so it's just real quick filling

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.070 
letter so it's just real quick filling
to<00:05:28.160> give<00:05:28.910> me<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.060> sense<00:05:29.360> of<00:05:29.540> how<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.840> looks

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
to give me a sense of how that looks

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.930 
to give me a sense of how that looks
look<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.190> got<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.370> nice<00:05:31.669> little<00:05:33.669> lock<00:05:34.669> letter

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
look you got a nice little lock letter

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.900 
look you got a nice little lock letter
to<00:05:35.389> start<00:05:35.630> off<00:05:35.810> with<00:05:36.020> there<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:37.669> course

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
to start off with there and of course

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.480 
to start off with there and of course
you<00:05:38.060> can<00:05:38.180> add<00:05:38.330> any<00:05:38.540> kind<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.870> ornamentation

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
you can add any kind of ornamentation

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.540 
you can add any kind of ornamentation
that<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:40.610> want<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:42.800> take<00:05:43.010> like<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.280> thicker

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
that you want to take like a thicker

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.690 
that you want to take like a thicker
marker<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.860> kind<00:05:45.860> of<00:05:45.919> think<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.280> this<00:05:46.460> looks

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
marker I kind of think that this looks

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:56.980 
marker I kind of think that this looks
good<00:05:46.910> sometimes<00:05:47.150> we<00:05:47.600> need<00:05:48.310> nice

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.510 

so<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.620> nice<00:05:57.770> thing<00:05:58.009> about<00:05:58.039> this<00:05:58.310> technique

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
so the nice thing about this technique

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.060 
so the nice thing about this technique
is<00:05:58.940> that<00:05:58.970> you<00:05:59.180> can<00:05:59.539> do<00:05:59.690> this<00:05:59.930> this<00:06:00.650> is<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.860> same

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
is that you can do this this is the same

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.460 
is that you can do this this is the same
way<00:06:01.250> that<00:06:01.460> graffiti<00:06:02.030> artists<00:06:02.509> learn<00:06:02.720> how<00:06:03.440> to

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
way that graffiti artists learn how to

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.249 
way that graffiti artists learn how to
draw<00:06:03.740> their<00:06:03.949> lettering<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.720> could<00:06:05.720> do<00:06:05.840> it<00:06:06.020> if

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
draw their lettering you could do it if

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.740 
draw their lettering you could do it if
you<00:06:06.410> were<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:06.800> an<00:06:07.580> arts<00:06:07.820> and<00:06:07.880> crafts<00:06:08.300> person

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
you were just an arts and crafts person

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.689 
you were just an arts and crafts person
trying<00:06:09.320> to<00:06:09.380> make<00:06:09.530> cards<00:06:09.800> or<00:06:10.220> signs<00:06:12.520> if<00:06:13.520> you're

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
trying to make cards or signs if you're

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.629 
trying to make cards or signs if you're
trying<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.000> learn<00:06:14.509> graphic<00:06:14.930> design<00:06:15.639> even

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
trying to learn graphic design even

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.070 
trying to learn graphic design even
though<00:06:16.850> all<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.210> type<00:06:17.419> is<00:06:17.570> on<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:17.780> computer

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
though all the type is on the computer

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.430 
though all the type is on the computer
these<00:06:18.320> days<00:06:19.150> hand<00:06:20.150> drawing<00:06:20.479> and<00:06:20.750> letters<00:06:21.199> can

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
these days hand drawing and letters can

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.990 
these days hand drawing and letters can
really<00:06:21.919> help<00:06:22.220> you<00:06:23.139> learn<00:06:24.139> those<00:06:25.000> subtle

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
really help you learn those subtle

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.659 
really help you learn those subtle
differences<00:06:26.509> between<00:06:26.570> different<00:06:27.410> fonts<00:06:27.800> and

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
differences between different fonts and

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.580 
differences between different fonts and
you'll<00:06:29.000> start<00:06:29.270> just<00:06:29.479> really<00:06:30.080> start<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.470> look

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
you'll start just really start to look

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.210 
you'll start just really start to look
at<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:30.860> details<00:06:31.280> of<00:06:31.520> them<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:33.560> it's<00:06:33.979> a<00:06:34.039> good

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
at the details of them so it's a good

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.790 
at the details of them so it's a good
it's<00:06:34.849> a<00:06:34.910> good<00:06:34.940> learning<00:06:35.389> tool<00:06:35.620> it's<00:06:36.620> a<00:06:36.650> good

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
it's a good learning tool it's a good

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.570 
it's a good learning tool it's a good
way<00:06:36.949> to<00:06:36.979> just<00:06:37.250> come<00:06:37.820> in<00:06:37.930> develop<00:06:38.930> your<00:06:39.080> eye<00:06:39.580> and

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
way to just come in develop your eye and

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.140 
way to just come in develop your eye and
ideally<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:41.930> eventually<00:06:42.229> learn<00:06:42.880> the<00:06:43.880> shapes

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
ideally you eventually learn the shapes

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.339 
ideally you eventually learn the shapes
of<00:06:44.270> these<00:06:44.389> letters<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:44.900> you<00:06:44.960> don't<00:06:45.139> have<00:06:45.229> to

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
of these letters and you don't have to

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.540 
of these letters and you don't have to
go<00:06:45.440> through<00:06:45.620> this<00:06:45.710> whole<00:06:45.889> process<00:06:46.099> of

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
go through this whole process of

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.820 
go through this whole process of
printing<00:06:46.970> and<00:06:47.240> drawing<00:06:47.479> the<00:06:47.599> blocks<00:06:47.840> it'll

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
printing and drawing the blocks it'll

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.969 
printing and drawing the blocks it'll
just<00:06:48.979> kind<00:06:49.099> of<00:06:49.220> know<00:06:49.840> how<00:06:53.440> the<00:06:54.440> letters<00:06:54.800> are

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
just kind of know how the letters are

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.540 
just kind of know how the letters are
supposed<00:06:55.759> to<00:06:55.849> shape<00:06:56.120> up<00:06:57.099> just<00:06:58.099> be<00:06:58.220> able<00:06:58.310> to

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
supposed to shape up just be able to

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:09.360 
supposed to shape up just be able to
draw<00:06:58.789> them<00:06:58.970> out<00:06:59.120> directly

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.030 

so<00:07:10.030> there<00:07:10.180> we<00:07:10.270> go<00:07:10.530> kind<00:07:11.530> of<00:07:11.560> filled<00:07:11.830> in<00:07:11.980> a

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
so there we go kind of filled in a

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.720 
so there we go kind of filled in a
little<00:07:12.370> bit<00:07:12.720> and<00:07:13.720> I<00:07:14.290> think<00:07:15.190> that's<00:07:15.490> all<00:07:15.699> for

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.730 
little bit and I think that's all for

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.629
