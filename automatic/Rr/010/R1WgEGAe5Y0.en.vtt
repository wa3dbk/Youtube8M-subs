00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
arrow then just hit OK next one is our X

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.810 
arrow then just hit OK next one is our X
F<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.920> looking<00:00:52.339> for<00:00:52.960> four<00:00:57.159> four<00:00:58.159> thousand

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
F it is looking for four four thousand

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
F it is looking for four four thousand
and<00:00:59.530> 1/8

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 

and<00:01:05.190> that's<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.240> ahead<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> hit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and that's it so we go ahead and hit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.150 
and that's it so we go ahead and hit
okay<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:09.180> XD<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.990> zeroes<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.800> we've

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
okay now our XD is all zeroes so we've

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.850 
okay now our XD is all zeroes so we've
hit<00:01:11.400> okay<00:01:12.530> mth<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.050> A<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hit okay mth we need to put an A in the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.840 
hit okay mth we need to put an A in the
fourth<00:01:17.130> position

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
fourth position

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.360 
fourth position
so<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.960> arrow<00:01:19.170> over<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.410> go<00:01:22.530> plus<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.040> minus

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
so we arrow over we can go plus or minus

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.950 
so we arrow over we can go plus or minus
just<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.940> keep<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.150> till<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
just to keep going till I get to the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
just to keep going till I get to the
letters<00:01:25.760> there's<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:30.560> two<00:01:31.560> zeroes<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:33.979> 1

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.700 

seven<00:01:41.350> rest<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:42.530> zeros<00:01:42.890> okay<00:01:44.110> ask<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> name

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
seven rest are zeros okay ask for a name

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.960 
seven rest are zeros okay ask for a name
and<00:01:46.130> here<00:01:46.460> they<00:01:46.610> name<00:01:46.790> it

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and here they name it

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.650 
and here they name it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
pressing it until we see HP are there

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.530 
pressing it until we see HP are there
you<00:02:29.930> go

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
you go

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.569 
you go
easy<00:02:32.540> enough

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.130 

all<00:02:37.579> right<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.060> after<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:38.450> put<00:02:38.659> all<00:02:38.930> those

corner<00:02:46.189> is<00:02:47.180> giving<00:02:47.540> us<00:02:47.689> a<00:02:47.900> horsepower<00:02:48.709> reading

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
corner is giving us a horsepower reading

is<00:02:50.370> gross<00:02:50.880> more<00:02:51.270> brake<00:02:51.569> horsepower

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
is gross more brake horsepower

is gross more brake horsepower
is<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.110> new<00:02:54.560> feature<00:02:54.769> i<00:02:54.950> dislike<00:02:55.459> greatly<00:02:55.849> which

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
is a new feature i dislike greatly which

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.170 
is a new feature i dislike greatly which
is<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.420> cost<00:02:56.780> per<00:02:57.050> mile<00:02:57.230> which<00:02:57.879> tallied<00:02:58.879> up<00:02:58.940> is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
is the cost per mile which tallied up is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.180 
is the cost per mile which tallied up is
pretty<00:02:59.599> accurate

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.660 

a<00:03:03.220> mile

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.089

number left rpm
water<00:03:10.489> temperature<00:03:10.969> so<00:03:11.840> when<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.260> jump<00:03:12.469> on<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
water temperature so when we jump on the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.670 
water temperature so when we jump on the
gas<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.829> bit<00:03:13.269> we'll<00:03:14.269> get<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.510> horsepower<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.230> go

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
gas a bit we'll get the horsepower to go

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.960 
gas a bit we'll get the horsepower to go
up

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.840 

we<00:03:20.330> let<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.660> gas

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.199 

somewhere<00:03:27.360> right<00:03:27.390> around<00:03:27.660> there

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.229 

so<00:03:32.810> gives<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.500> general<00:03:33.920> idea<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.489> what<00:03:35.060> your

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so gives you a general idea of what your
