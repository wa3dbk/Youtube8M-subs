00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome new people to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 our first video from fotolia I am 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.710
 no this is my bird partner mirco 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.270
 was in front of the camera on the camera and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 we've had quite a lot lately 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
 get questions on facebook like us 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.500
 our ops in the light painting pictures 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.990
 and now I'm going to get that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.220
 Bicycle tires with which we take the pictures 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.650
 Do that is the good thing that is 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.260
 to help a commercial cloned 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.420
 no nonsense stolen 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.020
 In any case, he modified that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.290
 chris blight petting is optimized 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.030
 here content of an axis have the end 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.460
 animals after 30 40 cm around it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.970
 allow him to bicycle tires at an angle 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.720
 how long does one do this? 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.890
 Is a matter of taste 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 depending on how or if you want the places 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.830
 later I would like to have a picture so I 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.690
 demonstrate it once you turn it 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.000
 this is just half this thought 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.520
 At the driver tires are in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.620
 even distances led lights 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 I have this pretty much assembled 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.140
 Cumbersome because every LED light 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 must be turned on individually mach 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.350
 I do not know if you can do that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.580
 now in the video so still looks in here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.540
 our recordings are as follows 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.890
 I placed the place with 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.729
 switched lights in the location 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.650
 important was the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.570
 camera settings is that we are on the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.250
 mode soon and that we are one 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 relatively closed aperture stop 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.970
 use like that in the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.020
 Landscape photography is common around 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.390
 to get everything spicy yes us 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.479
 Place us tears grab like here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.629
 to see and in this time we solve 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.410
 Depending on how long we take the camera 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.990
 We want to report that together and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.690
 we usually do that so we do 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.090
 three to five turns stop that 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.490
 Rotate bicycle tires 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.830
 yes and before we stop like 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.850
 we record and that's how we stop 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.790
 the optimal place and yes I ask 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.310
 now how have only one recording so 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.190
 a place is top and that is what we do 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.630
 so we stop our cameras on the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.540
 tripods that we set a firm 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.070
 have a picture and then we do 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.250
 stop several shots and sketches the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.830
 later together in photoshop and that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.870
 Somehow everything if you ask more 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.700
 should have written then just write us 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.860
 on under facebook we are actually 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 always available 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 and yes, I'm pretty much back 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.880
 that must be fine with me somehow 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.880
 come cut 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.860
 low soundcheck tests soundcheck 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.200
 soundcheck on the places finished people 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.420
 welcome now 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:04:26.320
 for requests how we make our ops 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:04:41.490
 like our people who said that 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:41.490
 toughest photographers again 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.370
 court 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.650
 So, in the evening, you'll be fou
