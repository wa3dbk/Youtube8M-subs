00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
I use almost nothing else as long as I

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.650 
I use almost nothing else as long as I
have<00:01:08.510> speed<00:01:08.690> unlocked<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:10.270> that's<00:01:11.270> awesome

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.330 
have speed unlocked and that's awesome
right<00:01:12.050> because<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.800> know<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.010> gives<00:01:13.190> you<00:01:13.280> a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
right because you know it gives you a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.980 
right because you know it gives you a
lot<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.550> mobility<00:01:13.760> you're<00:01:14.390> you're<00:01:14.690> great<00:01:14.900> and

lot of mobility you're you're great and

lot of mobility you're you're great and
all<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.860> downside<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.730> whole

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
all that but the downside to this whole

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.970 
all that but the downside to this whole
thing<00:01:16.940> is<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.600> what<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.380> noticed<00:01:18.710> with<00:01:18.770> myself

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
thing is that what I noticed with myself

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.220 
thing is that what I noticed with myself
is<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.370> end<00:01:19.700> up<00:01:19.820> running<00:01:20.060> around<00:01:20.300> all<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.050> time

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
is I end up running around all the time

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.290 
is I end up running around all the time
and<00:01:21.920> because<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.460> speed<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.000> because<00:01:23.150> of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
and because of speed and because of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.000 
and because of speed and because of
extreme<00:01:23.660> conditioning<00:01:24.200> which<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:24.710> use

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
extreme conditioning which I also use

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.630 
extreme conditioning which I also use
quite<00:01:25.760> often<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:27.530> get<00:01:27.740> into<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.100> habit<00:01:28.340> of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
quite often you get into that habit of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.730 
quite often you get into that habit of
okay<00:01:29.120> I<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.360> extreme<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.410> know<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.530> have

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
okay I have extreme you know I have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.950 
okay I have extreme you know I have
unlimited<00:01:31.400> sprint<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:32.420> move<00:01:32.750> real<00:01:32.930> quick

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
unlimited sprint and I move real quick

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.420 
unlimited sprint and I move real quick
so<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.380> could<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:33.770> run<00:01:33.920> around<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.220> entire

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
so you could just run around the entire

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.910 
so you could just run around the entire
map<00:01:34.610> but<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.510> problem<00:01:35.900> amaura<00:01:36.590> where<00:01:36.770> for

but yeah you're gonna you're gonna die

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.110 
but yeah you're gonna you're gonna die
if<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.170> keep<00:01:45.320> running<00:01:45.530> around<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.400> if

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
if you just keep running around so if

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.600 
if you just keep running around so if
you<00:01:47.450> use<00:01:48.140> speed<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.830> especially<00:01:49.100> extreme

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
you use speed and especially extreme

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.710 
you use speed and especially extreme
condition<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.150> have<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.540> little

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
condition you have to be a little

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.370 
condition you have to be a little
careful<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.730> what<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.760> mean<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.380> corners

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
careful with that what I mean is corners

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.230 
careful with that what I mean is corners
like<00:01:54.800> when<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.400> pop<00:01:55.550> out<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.880> corner

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
like when you pop out of a corner

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.000 
like when you pop out of a corner
especially<00:01:56.420> with<00:01:56.810> speed<00:01:57.050> or<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:57.530> you're

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
especially with speed or so on you're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.800 
especially with speed or so on you're
not<00:01:58.160> always<00:01:58.490> gonna<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:59.150> time<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.630> actually

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
not always gonna have time to actually

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.220 
not always gonna have time to actually
lift<00:02:00.500> up<00:02:00.650> your<00:02:00.830> gun<00:02:01.010> from<00:02:01.340> sprint<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:02.120> sniper<00:02:03.020> of

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
lift up your gun from sprint a sniper of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.250 
lift up your gun from sprint a sniper of
course<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.770> get<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.850> shot<00:02:05.090> off<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:06.080> may

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
course and get that shot off and you may

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.229 
course and get that shot off and you may
see<00:02:06.320> me<00:02:06.680> die<00:02:06.860> quite<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> few<00:02:07.430> times<00:02:07.640> when<00:02:07.850> you

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
see me die quite a few times when you

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.240 
see me die quite a few times when you
just<00:02:08.329> sprint<00:02:09.140> around<00:02:09.409> the<00:02:09.590> corner<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.129> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
just sprint around the corner and you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.940 
just sprint around the corner and you
have<00:02:10.399> literally<00:02:10.759> no<00:02:10.969> times<00:02:11.209> wait<00:02:11.450> yes

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
have literally no times wait yes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.190 
have literally no times wait yes
don't<00:02:12.730> forget<00:02:12.910> also<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.240> shots<00:02:13.600> now<00:02:14.080> gonna

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
don't forget also that shots now gonna

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.620 
don't forget also that shots now gonna
be<00:02:14.380> extremely<00:02:14.830> accurate<00:02:15.450> coming<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.600> out

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
be extremely accurate coming right out

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.380 
be extremely accurate coming right out
of<00:02:16.750> Sprint<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.070> best<00:02:18.250> thing<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.640> if<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.240> do

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
of Sprint so the best thing is if you do

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.820 
of Sprint so the best thing is if you do
use<00:02:19.540> sprint<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.020> me<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.470> run<00:02:20.710> around

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
use sprint like me and you run around

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.710 
use sprint like me and you run around
like<00:02:21.040> crazy<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.730> make<00:02:22.030> sure<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.390> kind<00:02:22.570> of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
like crazy then make sure you kind of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.930 
like crazy then make sure you kind of
stop<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.230> take<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> chill<00:02:24.490> breath<00:02:24.730> before

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
stop and take a chill breath before

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.630 
stop and take a chill breath before
every<00:02:25.420> corner<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.130> obviously<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.250> look<00:02:27.490> for

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
every corner and obviously now look for

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.690 
every corner and obviously now look for
campers<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.090> all<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> but<00:02:29.340> can't<00:02:30.340> really<00:02:30.460> do

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
campers and all that but can't really do

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.100 
campers and all that but can't really do
much<00:02:30.730> against<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.330> guess<00:02:31.600> except<00:02:31.960> being

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
much against that I guess except being

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.080 
much against that I guess except being
careful<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.770> yeah<00:02:33.070> be<00:02:33.460> careful<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.880> speed

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
careful but yeah be careful with speed

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.090 
careful but yeah be careful with speed
now<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> other<00:02:35.110> thing<00:02:35.350> which<00:02:35.560> also<00:02:35.800> kelp

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
now the other thing which also kelp

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.500 
now the other thing which also kelp
helps<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.610> whole<00:02:36.790> thing<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.180> obviously

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
helps in this whole thing is obviously

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.070 
helps in this whole thing is obviously
the<00:02:37.660> radar<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:39.480> let's<00:02:40.480> talk<00:02:40.600> about<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
the radar but like let's talk about to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.600 
the radar but like let's talk about to
what<00:02:41.260> extent<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.740> actually<00:02:42.010> want<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.220> use<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
what extent you actually want to use the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.400 
what extent you actually want to use the
radar<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.270> there's<00:02:43.480> there's<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.230> one

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
radar because there's there's on one

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.930 
radar because there's there's on one
side<00:02:44.590> expectrum<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.190> know<00:02:45.340> people<00:02:45.640> who<00:02:45.730> never

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
side expectrum you know people who never

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.390 
side expectrum you know people who never
look<00:02:46.210> at<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> radar<00:02:46.720> they're<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.110> blind<00:02:47.560> yeah

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
look at a radar they're like blind yeah

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.250 
look at a radar they're like blind yeah
like<00:02:48.910> there'll<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.240> four<00:02:49.570> red<00:02:49.750> dots<00:02:49.960> on<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
like there'll be four red dots on the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.680 
like there'll be four red dots on the
radar<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.770> they'd<00:02:50.830> still<00:02:51.070> be<00:02:51.100> going<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
radar and they'd still be going like I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.960 
radar and they'd still be going like I
always<00:02:52.900> say<00:02:53.110> anybody<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.220> obviously<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.940> know

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
always say anybody so obviously you know

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.340 
always say anybody so obviously you know
I<00:02:55.060> mean<00:02:55.240> everyone<00:02:55.720> knows<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.990> got<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> keep

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
I mean everyone knows you got to keep

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.870 
I mean everyone knows you got to keep
your<00:02:56.500> eyes<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.920> radar<00:02:57.250> every<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
your eyes on the radar every now and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.610 
your eyes on the radar every now and
then<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.240> especially<00:02:58.720> any<00:02:59.050> time<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.410> hear

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
then and especially any time you hear

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.430 
then and especially any time you hear
like<00:02:59.800> let's<00:03:00.010> say<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> shot<00:03:00.490> go<00:03:00.670> off<00:03:01.290> look<00:03:02.290> at<00:03:02.350> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
like let's say a shot go off look at the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
like let's say a shot go off look at the
radar<00:03:02.620> figure<00:03:03.460> out<00:03:03.580> where<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.820> shot<00:03:04.000> came

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
radar figure out where that shot came

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.140 
radar figure out where that shot came
from<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.010> downside<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.730> or<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
from but the downside of that or the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.660 
from but the downside of that or the
other<00:03:07.270> side<00:03:07.570> of<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.830> whole<00:03:08.830> debate<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
other side of the whole debate is that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.600 
other side of the whole debate is that
if<00:03:10.360> you've<00:03:10.600> stared<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.320> radar<00:03:11.860> too<00:03:12.100> long<00:03:12.310> and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
if you've stared the radar too long and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.600 
if you've stared the radar too long and
I've<00:03:12.880> done<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.240> myself<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.870> many<00:03:14.500> times<00:03:14.800> you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
I've done this myself for many times you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.190 
I've done this myself for many times you
can<00:03:15.760> actually<00:03:16.030> whoa

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
can actually whoa

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.449 
can actually whoa
die<00:03:17.500> because<00:03:17.830> you're<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.160> paying<00:03:18.340> attention

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
die because you're not paying attention

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.490 
die because you're not paying attention
or<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.209> see<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.570> tiny<00:03:20.380> little

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
or you don't see that tiny little

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.560 
or you don't see that tiny little
assassin<00:03:21.340> sneak<00:03:21.820> around<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.150> corner<00:03:22.450> or

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
something like that and what I'm trying

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.990 
something like that and what I'm trying
to<00:03:25.450> say<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.840> don't<00:03:26.260> spaced<00:03:26.709> out<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.640> radar

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
to say is don't spaced out to the radar

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.729 
to say is don't spaced out to the radar
because<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:28.780> especially<00:03:29.260> if<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:29.709> a

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
because I know especially if you have a

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.120 
because I know especially if you have a
UAV<00:03:30.040> or<00:03:30.370> god<00:03:31.120> forbid<00:03:31.239> an<00:03:31.540> advanced<00:03:31.900> UAV<00:03:32.320> uh<00:03:32.350> you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
know you're gonna you're gonna really

know you're gonna you're gonna really
want<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.440> stare<00:03:35.680> at<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:35.950> radar<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.520> kind<00:03:36.670> of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
want to stare at that radar and kind of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.910 
want to stare at that radar and kind of
just<00:03:36.850> approach<00:03:37.239> your<00:03:37.450> enemy<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.050> get<00:03:38.709> them

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
just approach your enemy and get them

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.500 
just approach your enemy and get them
but<00:03:39.100> don't<00:03:39.190> forget<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.610> there's<00:03:40.000> assassins

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
but don't forget a there's assassins

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.990 
but don't forget a there's assassins
everywhere<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:41.290> mean<00:03:41.800> how<00:03:42.220> often<00:03:42.670> do<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:42.940> play

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
everywhere I mean how often do you play

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.590 
everywhere I mean how often do you play
in<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.239> game<00:03:43.420> where<00:03:43.570> there's<00:03:43.780> no<00:03:43.900> assassins<00:03:44.400> be

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
in a game where there's no assassins be

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.360 
in a game where there's no assassins be
yeah<00:03:46.600> like<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.350> not<00:03:47.800> always<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> best

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
yeah like it's not always the best

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.560 
yeah like it's not always the best
chance<00:03:48.670> because<00:03:48.850> someone<00:03:49.180> might<00:03:49.270> spawn

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
chance because someone might spawn

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.390 
chance because someone might spawn
behind<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.050> or<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.890> radar<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.220> not

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
behind you or so on and the radar is not

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.740 
behind you or so on and the radar is not
always<00:03:51.550> gonna<00:03:51.790> catch<00:03:52.000> them<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.390> you'll<00:03:52.570> have

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
always gonna catch them so you'll have

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.350 
always gonna catch them so you'll have
to<00:03:52.989> rely<00:03:53.200> on<00:03:53.350> your<00:03:53.680> eyesight<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.459> look<00:03:55.209> at<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
to rely on your eyesight so look at the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.199 
to rely on your eyesight so look at the
radar<00:03:55.630> quickly<00:03:56.200> look<00:03:56.830> back<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.910> should<00:03:58.120> be

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
radar quickly look back and I should be

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.920 
radar quickly look back and I should be
it<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:59.530> basically<00:04:00.010> it's<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.720> guess<00:04:01.720> it's

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
it but basically it's like I guess it's

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.229 
it but basically it's like I guess it's
exactly<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.440> way<00:04:02.560> my<00:04:02.590> football<00:04:03.310> coaches<00:04:03.700> have

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
exactly the way my football coaches have

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.510 
exactly the way my football coaches have
always<00:04:04.780> taught<00:04:05.020> me<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.200> know<00:04:05.320> it's

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
always taught me you know it's

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.440 
always taught me you know it's
fundamentals<00:04:06.520> stick<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.239> fundamentals

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
fundamentals stick to the fundamentals

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.920 
fundamentals stick to the fundamentals
and<00:04:08.370> that's<00:04:09.370> exactly<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.880> like<00:04:10.120> make<00:04:10.600> sure<00:04:10.810> you

get you run for cover
it's<00:05:28.200> way<00:05:28.500> better<00:05:28.740> than<00:05:28.890> actually<00:05:29.610> staying

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
it's way better than actually staying

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.100 
it's way better than actually staying
there<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.180> try<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.360> take<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:30.720> second<00:05:31.080> shot

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
there and try to take that second shot

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170 
there and try to take that second shot
missing<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.740> dying<00:05:31.920> there<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.730> no<00:05:32.850> shame<00:05:33.150> in

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
missing and dying there is no shame in

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.270 
missing and dying there is no shame in
just<00:05:33.540> running<00:05:33.960> around<00:05:34.200> a<00:05:34.560> little<00:05:34.650> bit<00:05:34.890> having

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
just running around a little bit having

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.100 
just running around a little bit having
time<00:05:35.670> to<00:05:35.850> reload<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.270> perhaps<00:05:36.570> cocking<00:05:36.990> your

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
time to reload the perhaps cocking your

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.140 
time to reload the perhaps cocking your
bullet<00:05:37.380> then<00:05:38.190> coming<00:05:38.460> back<00:05:38.490> and<00:05:38.790> killing<00:05:38.940> him

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
bullet then coming back and killing him

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.350 
bullet then coming back and killing him
I<00:05:39.420> mean<00:05:39.750> it's<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:41.310> works<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.880> well<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.330> know

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
I mean it's it works so well you know

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.150 
I mean it's it works so well you know
that<00:05:42.630> note<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.020> know<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:43.620> gotta<00:05:43.800> know<00:05:43.890> where

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
that note you know you gotta know where

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.070 
that note you know you gotta know where
all<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.370> cover<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:44.820> like<00:05:45.120> drop<00:05:45.840> shotting

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
all the cover is like drop shotting

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.460 
all the cover is like drop shotting
behind<00:05:46.500> certain<00:05:46.680> things<00:05:47.070> or<00:05:47.310> just<00:05:48.470> stick

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
behind certain things or just stick

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.520 
behind certain things or just stick
close<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.100> walls<00:05:50.340> like<00:05:50.970> here<00:05:51.780> okay<00:05:52.080> here<00:05:52.500> I

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
close to the walls like here okay here I

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.870 
close to the walls like here okay here I
probably<00:05:52.830> left<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.310> one<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> little<00:05:53.730> quick

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
probably left that one a little quick

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.210 
probably left that one a little quick
but<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.060> see<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.330> don't<00:05:54.450> chase<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.020> guy<00:05:55.220> that

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
but you see I don't chase the guy that

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.560 
but you see I don't chase the guy that
and<00:05:56.400> that's<00:05:56.730> actually<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:57.060> good<00:05:57.180> thing<00:05:57.240> that's

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
and that's actually a good thing that's

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.120 
and that's actually a good thing that's
why<00:05:57.720> I<00:05:57.750> think<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.170> survive<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.650> this<00:05:58.740> case<00:05:58.950> is

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
why I think I survive in this case is

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.560 
why I think I survive in this case is
because<00:05:59.400> if<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.670> chase<00:05:59.910> him<00:06:00.090> he's<00:06:00.330> most

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
because if you chase him he's most

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.120 
because if you chase him he's most
likely<00:06:00.840> gonna<00:06:00.930> do<00:06:01.170> exactly<00:06:01.290> what<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.650> do<00:06:01.770> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
likely gonna do exactly what I do and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.540 
likely gonna do exactly what I do and
that<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.430> bait<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.790> but<00:06:03.540> anyway<00:06:04.340> this<00:06:05.340> has

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
that is bait you but anyway this has

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.000 
that is bait you but anyway this has
gone<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.940> little<00:06:06.180> too<00:06:06.570> quickly<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.200> sadly<00:06:07.920> I'm

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.320

gonna<00:06:08.160> have<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.370> continue<00:06:08.520> in<00:06:08.850> my<00:06:08.910> next
