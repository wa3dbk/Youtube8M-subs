weight is constantly on the display of
the<00:00:30.359> terminal<00:00:31.170> itself<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:34.050> gonna

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the terminal itself now we're gonna

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.780 
the terminal itself now we're gonna
start<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> sequence<00:00:34.980> by<00:00:35.520> scanning<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
start the sequence by scanning the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:48.550 
start the sequence by scanning the
article

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.790 

yeah<00:00:49.160> now<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.180> article<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:50.990> in<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.350> computer

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
yeah now the article is in the computer

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.950 
yeah now the article is in the computer
we<00:00:51.980> select<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.750> product<00:00:53.990> and<00:00:55.090> we<00:00:56.090> select<00:00:56.630> we

is in stored in the PDA and now we

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.220 
is in stored in the PDA and now we
started<00:01:07.940> weighing<00:01:09.280> sequence<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.150> way<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.690> now

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
started weighing sequence the way is now

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.940 
started weighing sequence the way is now
being<00:01:12.560> taken<00:01:12.860> from<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.460> indicator<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.950> the
