got<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:22.470> walkie<00:00:23.470> Point<00:00:23.800> Lighthouse<00:00:24.180> now

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
got the walkie Point Lighthouse now

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.560 
got the walkie Point Lighthouse now
which<00:00:25.449> is<00:00:25.689> a<00:00:25.989> small<00:00:26.650> functioning<00:00:27.129> lighthouse

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
which is a small functioning lighthouse

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.499 
which is a small functioning lighthouse
it<00:00:28.570> has<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:29.250> central<00:00:30.250> cord<00:00:30.669> that<00:00:30.969> has<00:00:31.149> an<00:00:31.329> LED

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
it has a central cord that has an LED

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.750 
it has a central cord that has an LED
based<00:00:32.050> now<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.680> flashlight<00:00:32.980> basically

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
based now a flashlight basically

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.119 
based now a flashlight basically
shooting<00:00:34.000> up<00:00:34.210> through<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.420> turntable<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.200> then

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
shooting up through a turntable and then

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.950 
shooting up through a turntable and then
the<00:00:36.309> turntable<00:00:36.879> is<00:00:37.030> moving<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.510> reflector

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
the turntable is moving a reflector

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.110 
the turntable is moving a reflector
around<00:00:38.289> to<00:00:38.500> simulate<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.280> sweep<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
around to simulate the sweep of the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.810 
around to simulate the sweep of the
light<00:00:40.329> now<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:42.039> whole<00:00:42.190> thing<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.550> geared

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
light now and the whole thing is geared

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.510 
light now and the whole thing is geared
down<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.480> give<00:00:43.840> it<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.050> more<00:00:44.230> realistic<00:00:44.520> sweep

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
down to give it a more realistic sweep

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490 
down to give it a more realistic sweep
on<00:00:45.840> projecting<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.930> things<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.320> comes

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
on projecting the things so it comes

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.350 
on projecting the things so it comes
across<00:00:47.680> as<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.980> lighthouse<00:00:48.400> rather<00:00:48.760> than<00:00:49.030> say

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
across as a lighthouse rather than say

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.720 
across as a lighthouse rather than say
you<00:00:49.630> know<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.410> flashing<00:00:51.100> lights<00:00:51.280> on<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:51.430> police

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
you know the flashing lights on a police

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.060 
you know the flashing lights on a police
car<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.210> then<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.350> front<00:00:53.560> is<00:00:53.829> just

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
car and then the the front is just

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.639 
car and then the the front is just
basically<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:55.060> know<00:00:55.149> random<00:00:55.870> Rock<00:00:56.050> placement

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
basically you know random Rock placement

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.310 
basically you know random Rock placement
now<00:00:57.250> with<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.000> gratuitous<00:00:58.750> use<00:00:58.899> of<00:00:58.960> cheese

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
now with the gratuitous use of cheese

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.830 
now with the gratuitous use of cheese
wedges<00:00:59.530> since<00:00:59.980> probably<00:01:00.280> my<00:01:00.790> my<00:01:01.600> favorite

part since that was first introduced I

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.730 
part since that was first introduced I
probably<00:01:03.969> by<00:01:04.420> weight<00:01:04.659> use<00:01:04.989> about<00:01:05.259> as<00:01:05.439> many<00:01:05.619> of

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
probably by weight use about as many of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.080 
probably by weight use about as many of
those<00:01:05.890> as<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.219> have<00:01:06.369> of<00:01:06.490> all<00:01:06.640> other<00:01:06.850> bricks

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
that the toughest part for me was

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.300 
that the toughest part for me was
opening<00:01:32.139> the<00:01:32.259> box<00:01:32.469> when<00:01:32.709> I<00:01:32.740> got<00:01:33.009> here<00:01:33.279> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
opening the box when I got here and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.449 
opening the box when I got here and
finding<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.060> roof<00:01:34.270> was<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.689> pieces<00:01:35.459> and

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
finding that the roof was in pieces and

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.219 
finding that the roof was in pieces and
having<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:36.999> put<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.299> back<00:01:37.479> together<00:01:37.689> because

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
having to put that back together because

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.019 
having to put that back together because
it<00:01:38.319> was<00:01:38.380> very<00:01:38.619> delicately<00:01:39.100> held<00:01:39.399> together<00:01:39.549> and

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
it was very delicately held together and

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:42.899 
it was very delicately held together and
I<00:01:40.779> did<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.560> sufficiently<00:01:42.099> long<00:01:42.369> ago<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.880> I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
I did this sufficiently long ago that I

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.309 
I did this sufficiently long ago that I
couldn't<00:01:43.209> remember<00:01:43.359> exactly<00:01:43.599> how<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.229> went

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
couldn't remember exactly how it went

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.809 
couldn't remember exactly how it went
back<00:01:44.499> together<00:01:44.679> so<00:01:45.069> I'm<00:01:45.159> looking<00:01:45.429> at<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:45.700> and

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
back together so I'm looking at it and

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:46.349 
back together so I'm looking at it and
cycling

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
cycling

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.359 
cycling
okay<00:01:46.689> I<00:01:46.719> need<00:01:46.929> much<00:01:47.259> smaller<00:01:47.590> hands<00:01:48.069> to<00:01:48.219> do

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
okay I need much smaller hands to do

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.379 
okay I need much smaller hands to do
this<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.679> like<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.340> angles<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.209> like

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
this but I like the angles of it I like

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.199 
this but I like the angles of it I like
Howard<00:01:52.689> now<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.319> overall<00:01:53.709> look<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.759> it

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
Howard now the overall look that it

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.069 
Howard now the overall look that it
eventually<00:01:55.479> arrived<00:01:56.079> at<00:01:56.349> um<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
eventually arrived at um with the the

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.599 
eventually arrived at um with the the
guard<00:01:59.289> rail<00:01:59.499> going<00:01:59.799> around<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.279> and<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
guard rail going around it and the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.550 
guard rail going around it and the
handrails<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.389> front<00:02:01.599> stairs<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.409> the
