Apple does like that and they've never
like<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.820> Congress<00:00:23.820> said<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.330> just

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
like that and Congress said it's just

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
like that and Congress said it's just
fine<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.949> Apple<00:00:26.310> still<00:00:26.550> doesn't<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
fine but Apple still doesn't like that

free<00:00:37.170> apps<00:00:37.350> from<00:00:37.800> installous<00:00:38.210> which<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
free apps from installous which is the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.709 
free apps from installous which is the
only<00:00:39.809> reason<00:00:40.670> Apple<00:00:41.670> doesn't<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
only reason Apple doesn't like

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
only reason Apple doesn't like
jailbreaking<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> only<00:00:44.700> reason<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
jailbreaking it's the only reason it's a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.920 
jailbreaking it's the only reason it's a
little<00:00:45.719> app<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:50.449> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> text

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

little app right there down in the text
other<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.760> give<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
other than that they really don't give a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
other than that they really don't give a
shit<00:00:54.210> um<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.410> features<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.219> party<00:00:56.699> like

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
shit um all the features at a party like

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.830

down<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.850> maintaining<00:04:07.850> your<00:04:08.180> down<00:04:08.450> rating<00:04:08.989> may

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
down so maintaining your down rating may

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.130 
down so maintaining your down rating may
not<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.890> an<00:04:09.980> option<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.390> could<00:04:11.660> be<00:04:11.840> fucked
