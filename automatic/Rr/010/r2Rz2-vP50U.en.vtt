00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
it was almost few that I actually really

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.419 
it was almost few that I actually really
wanted<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.440> dropped<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:10.980> didn't<00:00:11.340> get

it
I<00:00:11.759> wouldn't<00:00:12.330> drop<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:12.929> they<00:00:13.110> had<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
I wouldn't drop because they had a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.310 
I wouldn't drop because they had a
pretty<00:00:13.860> limited<00:00:14.219> run<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.759> these<00:00:15.059> sneakers<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually end up finding things like this

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
actually end up finding things like this
at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> outlets<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.860> good<00:00:35.010> timing

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
at the outlets and it's just good timing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
at the outlets and it's just good timing
they<00:00:36.030> were<00:00:36.090> put<00:00:36.300> out<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> day<00:00:36.960> before

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
they were put out I think the day before

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.400 
they were put out I think the day before
and<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.780> these<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.379> are

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and and so these are what they are

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.130 
and and so these are what they are
they're<00:00:41.010> pythons<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.719> shoe<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
they're pythons and so this this shoe is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.410 
they're pythons and so this this shoe is
a<00:00:43.350> shoe<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.550> remember<00:00:44.850> from<00:00:45.300> back

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a shoe that I do not remember from back

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
a shoe that I do not remember from back
in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> day<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.170> 100%<00:00:46.590> honest<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
in the day to be 100% honest this is a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
in the day to be 100% honest this is a
shoe<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.510> before<00:00:48.660> my

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
shoe that was a little bit before my

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
shoe that was a little bit before my
time<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> shoe<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.370> originally

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
time but it was a shoe that originally

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.959 
time but it was a shoe that originally
came<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.449> years<00:00:51.780> ago<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.520> shoe<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> looks

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
came out years ago and a shoe that looks

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
came out years ago and a shoe that looks
very<00:00:54.090> familiar<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.840> lot<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> people<00:00:55.079> do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
very familiar to this a lot of people do

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
very familiar to this a lot of people do
some<00:00:56.190> comparisons<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.510> Air<00:00:57.629> Jordan<00:00:57.719> -<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
some comparisons to the Air Jordan - it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.110 
some comparisons to the Air Jordan - it
does<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.760> kind<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
does have a lot of the same kind of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
does have a lot of the same kind of
features<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.170> Jordan<00:01:01.440> -<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
features as they are Jordan - you can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
features as they are Jordan - you can
see<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> cuts<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.899> cuts<00:01:04.110> like

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
see the cuts like so and the cuts like

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.580 
see the cuts like so and the cuts like
so<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> hot<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.110> sits<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.470> bit

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so the hot this one sits a little bit

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.830 
so the hot this one sits a little bit
higher<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> twos<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.570> doesn't

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
higher than the twos and this doesn't

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
higher than the twos and this doesn't
have<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.320> back<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:12.000> may<00:01:12.180> be

quite a few similarities I've never seen
them<00:01:34.200> side-by-side<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.040> first<00:01:35.280> time

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
them side-by-side this is my first time

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
them side-by-side this is my first time
comparison<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.150> comparing<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
comparison you can comparing them you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.120 
comparison you can comparing them you
can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> stitching<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:37.920> here

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can see the stitching right here

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
can see the stitching right here
stitching<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.720> has

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
stitching right here but this one has

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
stitching right here but this one has
actually<00:01:40.110> stitching<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:40.950> around

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
actually stitching all the way around

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.690 
actually stitching all the way around
unlike<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> other<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.979> these<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> ones

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
unlike the other one these are the ones

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
unlike the other one these are the ones
from<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> most<00:01:45.840> recent<00:01:46.290> retro<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
from not the most recent retro that and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
from not the most recent retro that and
these<00:01:47.729> ones<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:47.970> coming<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> think

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
these ones are coming out again I think

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.469 
these ones are coming out again I think
in<00:01:49.770> 2014<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.939> ones<00:01:51.119> were<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> ones

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in 2014 but these ones were the ones

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
in 2014 but these ones were the ones
let's<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.259> got<00:01:52.860> I'll<00:01:53.159> check<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> tags

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
let's see here I got I'll check the tags

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
let's see here I got I'll check the tags
and<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> got<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.409> don't

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and see when I got these I don't

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.359 
and see when I got these I don't
remember

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
remember

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.969 
remember
I<00:01:56.420> got<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.540> years<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> couple<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> years<00:01:58.380> ago

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
I got them years a couple of years ago

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
I got them years a couple of years ago
oh<00:01:59.009> four<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.000> ones<00:02:00.149> came<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.570> o4

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
oh four so these ones came out at o4

those are 10 years old and you can tell

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.149 
those are 10 years old and you can tell
the<00:02:02.700> yellowing<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.479> tab<00:02:03.689> area<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.799> is

there but so anyway these are the the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.900 
there but so anyway these are the the
Pythons<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.599> colors<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.229> didn't<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.190> on

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
Pythons and the colors I didn't see on

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.210 
Pythons and the colors I didn't see on
the<00:02:12.060> box

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the box

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.600 
the box
I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:15.470> know<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.830> read<00:02:16.040> those<00:02:16.250> right

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
I don't know if you can read those right

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.520 
I don't know if you can read those right
here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
here
it<00:02:18.530> was<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:19.180> bar<00:02:20.180> OQ<00:02:20.600> Brown<00:02:21.550> interesting

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
it was like bar OQ Brown interesting

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.370 
it was like bar OQ Brown interesting
color<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.690> familiar<00:02:23.900> with<00:02:24.110> it

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
color I'm not really familiar with it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.810 
color I'm not really familiar with it
but<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> lifestyle<00:02:25.400> box<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.730> it

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
but I like the lifestyle box that it

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.100 
but I like the lifestyle box that it
came<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.240> kind<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.450> reminds<00:02:26.660> me<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.930> fun

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
came in it kind of reminds me of a fun

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.530 
came in it kind of reminds me of a fun
positive<00:02:27.260> box<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.580> let's<00:02:28.850> look<00:02:29.120> up<00:02:29.330> close

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
positive box but let's look up close

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.510 
positive box but let's look up close
look<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.930> Python<00:02:30.590> print<00:02:30.920> material<00:02:31.310> that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
look at this Python print material that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.700 
look at this Python print material that
was<00:02:31.610> pretty<00:02:31.970> awesome<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.510> my<00:02:32.540> opinion<00:02:32.710> you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
was pretty awesome in my opinion you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.170 
was pretty awesome in my opinion you
have<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:33.950> air<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.550> side<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.970> there

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
have that air on the side right there

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.790 
have that air on the side right there
but<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.840> materials<00:02:36.290> dope<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.620> kind<00:02:36.770> of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
but this materials dope it kind of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.290 
but this materials dope it kind of
sparkles<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> little<00:02:37.520> bit<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.910> will<00:02:38.030> just

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
sparkles a little bit if you will just

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.420 
sparkles a little bit if you will just
because<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.620> kind<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.130> scaled

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
because of the this kind of this scaled

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.210 
because of the this kind of this scaled
look<00:02:40.700> really<00:02:41.570> really<00:02:41.810> nice<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.100> can

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
look really really nice and then you can

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.300 
look really really nice and then you can
see<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.460> says<00:02:43.580> Nike<00:02:44.150> or<00:02:44.360> Python<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.990> tongue

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
see it says Nike or Python on the tongue

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.340 
see it says Nike or Python on the tongue
covered<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.520> Python<00:02:46.880> material<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.540> like

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
covered in that Python material I like

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.680 
covered in that Python material I like
that<00:02:48.590> even<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.280> little<00:02:49.520> little<00:02:50.090> subtle

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
that even just this little little subtle

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.030 
that even just this little little subtle
thing<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> having<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> laces<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.800> through

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
thing of having the laces go through

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.290 
thing of having the laces go through
that<00:02:52.190> makes<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.550> pop<00:02:52.730> out<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> little

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
that makes that pop out just a little

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.410 
that makes that pop out just a little
bit<00:02:53.420> more<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.550> hyped<00:02:55.820> up<00:02:56.090> crazy

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bit more and it's not a hyped up crazy

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.410 
bit more and it's not a hyped up crazy
shoe<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.800> limited<00:02:58.190> than<00:02:58.610> then

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
shoe like it's more limited than then

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.930 
shoe like it's more limited than then
some<00:02:59.660> but<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.350> not<00:03:00.500> overly<00:03:00.860> crazy<00:03:01.220> hyped<00:03:01.760> up

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
some but it's not overly crazy hyped up

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940 
some but it's not overly crazy hyped up
you<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.300> probably<00:03:02.690> pick<00:03:02.900> him<00:03:03.050> up<00:03:03.140> for<00:03:03.410> close

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
you can probably pick him up for close

you can probably pick him up for close

eventually hit my outlet that would be
pretty<00:03:24.620> ridiculous<00:03:25.040> if<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.400> did<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.900> yeah<00:03:26.989> man
