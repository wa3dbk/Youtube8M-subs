00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello friends again I want to tell you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 that is like the name of the video is a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.929
 theory this is the brother's theory of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.969
 us let's start the basics first 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.980
 we all know that they make weight like all 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.809
 the coaches with their initial pokemon 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 being a pikachu also in the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.619
 first versions of pokemon all 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 We believed that the coach network 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.449
 pokemon reviviera ace thing that as I just 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 to mention is not true friends since 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.859
 it's network a manga character pokemon 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.720
 special like all we've seen 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.940
 pokemon to date and his movies 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.910
 that several manga characters have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.739
 appeared as change in the anime go 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.040
 naming a green or also known 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 like gary gold crystal blue ruby sapphire 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 platinum diamond but by telling them this 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 they will realize that network missing 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.950
 main character of the manga but it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 says he is the older brother since in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.940
 the first network video game starts its 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 trip in 1996 and the anime does in 1997 to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 being the biggest will have to highlight more already 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 that he has won the pokemon league and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 defeated the rocket team but it has not 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.720
 never won the league without mentioning the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.670
 orange leagues 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.620
 but well that season has no 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 importance since it does not come out in any 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.970
 game or in the manga but anyway that's 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 one of the other theories is that as 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 we all know how to make weight with pikachu 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 because the other three had already 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 taken charm under they gave it to green 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 it's lost it stole glue but then it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.580
 they gave it and borba short it was red 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.590
 but in the anime it's fourth it stays 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.510
 and then you might think that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 return it remains redicha romÃ¡n der 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.200
 Good vlugt is also said that after 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 If he comes back, he shows him his 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 pikachu the teacher to give it to him 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
 and for that the picachu here knows so many 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 attacks and is so strong another part is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.300
 that also creates place and is committed 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.310
 network in defeat because he is the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.410
 strongest entrante of all and not in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.720
 well it appears on the way so only 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.730
 to show off that it's better 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 another is that pikachu never entered the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.180
 because ball of him that is the network already 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 that would be taken as theft from part of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.900
 there finally the likeness of like this network 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 It is very big here a picture to 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.840
 check yourselves good friends 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.150
 that was it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 as I said is a theory none of this 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.320
 it is proven but it would be very 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 interesting that this was true or not 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.270
 thanks for watching my video and even the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.270
 next
