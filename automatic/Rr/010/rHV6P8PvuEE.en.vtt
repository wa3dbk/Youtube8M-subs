00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 besides serdyuk 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.179

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.220
 rubles per person shells 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 I believe that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.409
 is to blame 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.830

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.690
 arrived 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.840

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.110
 battle of days 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.200
 Further 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.510

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.400
 going up 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.090
 our russia 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.440
 today is our country 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 length 6 times 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.500
 means 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 however 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 because then 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 Paris is very tasty 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.630
 2 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 Paris 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 in us 9 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.920
 moreover, as a society 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 car park with tokyo 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.440
 the second part is correct how to be 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.290
