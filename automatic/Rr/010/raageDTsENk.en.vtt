every other passionate exchange of ideas
in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.539> history<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> these

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
in the history of these

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.390 
in the history of these
the<00:01:53.870> bottom<00:01:54.200> line<00:01:54.380> beyond<00:01:54.800> all<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.100> debates

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
the bottom line beyond all the debates

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.040 
the bottom line beyond all the debates
is<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.970> these<00:01:56.150> cars<00:01:56.450> are<00:01:56.660> meant<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.900> be

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
is that these cars are meant to be

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.500 
is that these cars are meant to be
driven<00:01:57.260> not<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> street<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.880> Woodward<00:01:59.300> due

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
driven not on a street like Woodward due

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.660 
driven not on a street like Woodward due
to<00:01:59.630> something<00:01:59.840> called<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.290> law<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:01.430> perhaps

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
to something called the law and perhaps

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.670 
to something called the law and perhaps
an<00:02:01.970> empty<00:02:02.180> airfield<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:03.020> even<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.320> bit<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.470> rain

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
an empty airfield or even a bit of rain

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.840 
an empty airfield or even a bit of rain
doesn't<00:02:04.040> get<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.220> way<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.400> letting<00:02:04.640> these

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
doesn't get in the way of letting these

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:29.710 
doesn't get in the way of letting these
cars<00:02:05.180> play

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.230 

these<00:02:30.680> engines<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:31.280> pure<00:02:31.640> American<00:02:32.060> marching

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
these engines are pure American marching

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.300 
these engines are pure American marching
car<00:02:32.540> there's<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.320> mechanical<00:02:33.590> thing<00:02:33.980> out<00:02:34.160> there

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
car there's a mechanical thing out there

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.190 
car there's a mechanical thing out there
capable<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.940> delivering<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.480> much<00:02:35.690> joy<00:02:35.960> per

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
capable of delivering as much joy per

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.050 
capable of delivering as much joy per
dollar<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:36.710> these<00:02:36.890> two<00:02:37.070> cars<00:02:37.340> I'd<00:02:37.670> sure<00:02:37.910> like

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
dollar as these two cars I'd sure like

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:52.870 
dollar as these two cars I'd sure like
to<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.390 

so<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.750> true<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.050> they<00:02:54.110> say<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.950> mustangs

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
so it's true what they say the mustangs

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
so it's true what they say the mustangs
live<00:02:55.670> rear<00:02:55.910> axle<00:02:55.940> makes<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.660> perfect<00:02:56.990> roads

off<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.870> car<00:03:00.050> gets<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.530> squirrely
