since this is just a really quick follow
up<00:03:31.400> video<00:03:31.669> here's<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.329> full-size<00:03:32.810> benchmade

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
up video here's a full-size benchmade

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
up video here's a full-size benchmade
griptilian<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.190> size<00:03:34.340> comparison

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
griptilian just for size comparison

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.210 
griptilian just for size comparison
let's<00:03:35.510> put<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.810> up<00:03:35.900> there<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.859> can<00:03:36.980> tell

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
let's put it up there and you can tell

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.750 
let's put it up there and you can tell
that<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.239> rather<00:03:39.079> long<00:03:39.530> knife<00:03:39.829> not<00:03:40.609> as

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
that it is a rather long knife not as

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.069 
that it is a rather long knife not as
long<00:03:40.880> as<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.120> group<00:03:41.299> full-size<00:03:41.750> griptilian

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
long as the group full-size griptilian

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.140 
long as the group full-size griptilian
but<00:03:42.470> almost<00:03:42.829> as<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.220> can<00:03:43.310> tell<00:03:43.519> from<00:03:43.549> from

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
but almost as you can tell from from

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.949 
but almost as you can tell from from
tailed<00:03:44.389> ahead<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.549> but<00:03:47.359> is<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.660> lot

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
tailed ahead so but is this a lot

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.909 
tailed ahead so but is this a lot
slimmer<00:03:48.260> profile<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.450> lot<00:03:50.630> easier<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.079> EDC

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
slimmer profile and a lot easier to EDC

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.379 
slimmer profile and a lot easier to EDC
every<00:03:52.280> day<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.459> mean<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:52.970> bring<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.329> up

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
every day I mean if you bring it up

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.670 
every day I mean if you bring it up
close<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.660> camera<00:03:53.959> here<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.200> can<00:03:54.290> tell<00:03:54.470> that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
close to camera here you can tell that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.800 
close to camera here you can tell that
this<00:03:55.489> side<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.730> actually<00:03:56.090> thinner<00:03:56.269> than<00:03:56.510> one

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
this side is actually thinner than one

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.569 
this side is actually thinner than one
side<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.590> handle<00:03:57.889> scales<00:03:58.129> of<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
side of the handle scales of the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.369 
side of the handle scales of the
griptilian<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.419> it's<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.720> very<00:03:59.750> very<00:04:00.169> thin

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
griptilian so it's a very very thin

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.440 
griptilian so it's a very very thin
knife<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.739> very<00:04:00.769> nice<00:04:01.129> it's<00:04:01.730> very<00:04:01.879> nicely<00:04:02.120> made

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
knife is very nice it's very nicely made

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.619 
knife is very nice it's very nicely made
so<00:04:03.340> all<00:04:04.340> right<00:04:04.519> well<00:04:04.730> again<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.480> a

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
so all right well again this is just a

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.000 
so all right well again this is just a
follow<00:04:05.840> up<00:04:05.959> video<00:04:06.109> since<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.590> other<00:04:06.680> one<00:04:06.889> that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
follow up video since the other one that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.319 
follow up video since the other one that
