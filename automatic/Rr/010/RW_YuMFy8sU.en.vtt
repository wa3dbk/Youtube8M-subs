 English is not the case I want to be bought and to be content with 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.410

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640
 but I'm sorry but you'll pay me 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.949
 I know what I did here 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.439

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.569
 team at night has set 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.359
