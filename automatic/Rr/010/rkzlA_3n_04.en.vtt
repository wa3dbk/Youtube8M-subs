00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.440 

so<00:00:00.329> I'm<00:00:00.390> going<00:00:00.539> up<00:00:00.719> again<00:00:05.120> so<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.299> is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so I'm going up again so that is

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.820 
so I'm going up again so that is
interesting<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.049> should<00:00:07.259> actually<00:00:07.440> work

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
interesting this should actually work

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.400 
interesting this should actually work
with<00:00:08.010> most<00:00:08.220> quadcopters<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.929> had<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> flip

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
with most quadcopters that had the flip

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.820 
with most quadcopters that had the flip
feature<00:00:13.670> hi<00:00:14.670> quadcopter<00:00:15.330> 101<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> my

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
feature hi quadcopter 101 here one of my

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.970 
feature hi quadcopter 101 here one of my
viewers<00:00:17.100> contacted<00:00:17.970> me<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.560> wanted<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> share

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
viewers contacted me and wanted to share

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.700 
viewers contacted me and wanted to share
a<00:00:20.039> technique<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:21.240> he<00:00:21.359> had<00:00:21.449> been<00:00:21.600> using<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.529> do

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
a technique that he had been using to do

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.349 
a technique that he had been using to do
multi<00:00:23.550> flips<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.060> his<00:00:24.210> syma<00:00:24.480> x5c<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
multi flips with his syma x5c with that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.029 
multi flips with his syma x5c with that
that's<00:00:27.359> actually<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.900> manual<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.710> multi

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that's actually a manual way to do multi

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.550 
that's actually a manual way to do multi
flips<00:00:29.310> sign<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.449> Inter<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.750> interesting<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
flips sign and Inter are interesting to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040 
flips sign and Inter are interesting to
me<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> share<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.360> what

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
me and I want to share it with you what

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.709 
me and I want to share it with you what
he<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.469> done<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:35.160> he<00:00:35.460> had<00:00:36.149> suggested<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
he had done was he had suggested is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410 
he had done was he had suggested is
actually<00:00:37.380> activate<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> flip<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.210> quad

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
actually activate the flip of the quad

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850 
actually activate the flip of the quad
the<00:00:39.660> flip<00:00:39.870> button<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> quadcopter<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the flip button of the quadcopter and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
the flip button of the quadcopter and
then<00:00:41.070> tell<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.000> direction<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.629> quad<00:00:42.809> copter

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
then tell the direction the quad copter

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.080 
then tell the direction the quad copter
direction<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> flipping<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
direction of flipping that you want to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
direction of flipping that you want to
do<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.379> halfway<00:00:46.829> through<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
do and then when halfway through the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.740 
do and then when halfway through the
flip<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.930> cut<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> throttle<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
flip he would cut off the throttle and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
flip he would cut off the throttle and
then<00:00:51.750> let<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> multiple<00:00:53.010> flips<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
then let it do multiple flips from the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
then let it do multiple flips from the
momentum<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.140> first<00:00:55.410> flip

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
momentum of that of that first flip

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
momentum of that of that first flip
obviously<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.210> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
obviously if you're going to do this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
obviously if you're going to do this
you're<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.050> altitude<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.620> do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you're going to need some altitude to do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.560 
you're going to need some altitude to do
this<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.670> quad<00:00:59.879> copter<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this because the quad copter is going to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.090 
this because the quad copter is going to
be<00:01:00.660> dropping<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.469> time<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
be dropping at the same time as it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
be dropping at the same time as it's
flipping<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
flipping so that's what we're going to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.260 
flipping so that's what we're going to
try<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.379> today<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.909> multi

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
try to do today is to do this multi

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
try to do today is to do this multi
flipping<00:01:06.630> I'll<00:01:06.810> send<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> quad<00:01:07.380> copter<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
flipping I'll send a quad copter up to a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.570 
flipping I'll send a quad copter up to a
reasonable<00:01:09.240> altitude<00:01:10.080> start<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> flip<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
reasonable altitude start the flip and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
reasonable altitude start the flip and
then<00:01:12.240> halfway<00:01:12.510> through<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.990> flip<00:01:13.200> I'll<00:01:13.380> cut

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
then halfway through the flip I'll cut

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
then halfway through the flip I'll cut
off<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> throttle<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.700> let<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.000> drop<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> see

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
off the throttle and let it drop and see

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
off the throttle and let it drop and see
if<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.020> multiple<00:01:16.439> flips<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.400> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
if it can do multiple flips so this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.130 
if it can do multiple flips so this
should<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.090> interesting<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.810> give<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
should be interesting let's give it a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.670 
should be interesting let's give it a
try<00:01:20.060> ok<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.360> thing<00:01:21.600> let's<00:01:22.229> send<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
try ok first thing let's send it up to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
try ok first thing let's send it up to
altitude<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.960> predetermined<00:01:25.320> altitude<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
altitude the predetermined altitude that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.690 
altitude the predetermined altitude that
should<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.479> high<00:01:27.659> enough<00:01:28.640> activating<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
should be high enough activating the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.289 
should be high enough activating the
foot<00:01:29.880> button<00:01:31.159> okay<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.759> did<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.060> flip

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
foot button okay so we did one flip

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
foot button okay so we did one flip
let's<00:01:33.329> try<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.720> again

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 

so<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.689> you're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so if you do this you're going to need a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
so if you do this you're going to need a
lot<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> altitude<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.850> went

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
lot of altitude because it just went

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
lot of altitude because it just went
plowing<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> ground<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> did<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
plowing into the ground I did get a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.740 
plowing into the ground I did get a
couple<00:01:44.189> flips<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> though<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:46.049> saw

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
couple flips out of it though as you saw

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.969 
couple flips out of it though as you saw
but<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.810> ended<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> ground<00:01:49.680> let's<00:01:49.829> give

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
but it ended up in the ground let's give

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
but it ended up in the ground let's give
that<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.130> more<00:01:50.399> try<00:01:51.140> also<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that one more try also if you do this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
that one more try also if you do this
obviously<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> nice

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
obviously you want to do this on a nice

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.490 
obviously you want to do this on a nice
grassy<00:01:55.680> field<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:57.049> do<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.229> try

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
grassy field as you see here do not try

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
grassy field as you see here do not try
this<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:59.189> concrete<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.899> parking<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:02.630> let's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this on concrete or a parking lot let's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:15.980 
this on concrete or a parking lot let's
give<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.990> another<00:02:04.170> shot

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.890 

okay<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.790> give<00:02:18.970> yourself<00:02:19.300> plenty<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.750> altitude

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
okay so give yourself plenty of altitude

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.390 
okay so give yourself plenty of altitude
if<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.410> do<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:25.000> does<00:02:25.750> work<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:27.070> there<00:02:27.280> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
if you do this it does work but there is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100 
if you do this it does work but there is
a<00:02:27.430> good<00:02:27.640> chance<00:02:27.880> you're<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.630> impact<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
a good chance you're going to impact the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:41.160 
a good chance you're going to impact the
ground<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:30.430> up<00:02:30.640> again<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.660> let's<00:02:40.900> try<00:02:41.140> that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
ground going up again so let's try that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.130 
ground going up again so let's try that
again

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
again

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.480 
again
going<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.550> flipping<00:02:45.959> look<00:02:48.330> flipping<00:02:50.490> that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
going up flipping look flipping that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.260 
going up flipping look flipping that
weight

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.660 

yeah<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:56.990> can<00:02:57.260> get<00:02:57.350> quite<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.620> few<00:02:57.710> flips<00:03:00.670> let's

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
yeah you can get quite a few flips let's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.510 
yeah you can get quite a few flips let's
send<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:01.970> up<00:03:02.090> high<00:03:02.620> real<00:03:03.620> high<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:03.860> time

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
send it up high real high this time

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.430 
send it up high real high this time
okay<00:03:05.330> flippin<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.680> yes<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.070> does<00:03:10.280> work<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
okay flippin so yes it does work you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.610 
okay flippin so yes it does work you
need<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> lot<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.070> altitude<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.610> do<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:14.470> wind<00:03:15.470> up

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
need a lot of altitude to do it wind up

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.140 
need a lot of altitude to do it wind up
again<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:19.070> want<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.310> stop<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.730> fall<00:03:19.940> by

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
again and you want to stop the fall by

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.300 
again and you want to stop the fall by
halfway<00:03:20.570> down<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.590> are<00:03:22.040> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.250> need

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
halfway down so you are going to need

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.910 
halfway down so you are going to need
plenty<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.670> altitude<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.360> stop<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.050> fall<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
plenty of altitude to stop the fall so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.030 
plenty of altitude to stop the fall so
I'm<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.250> up<00:03:25.340> again<00:03:29.710> so<00:03:30.710> that<00:03:30.740> is

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
I'm going up again so that is

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.290 
I'm going up again so that is
interesting<00:03:31.550> this<00:03:31.670> should<00:03:31.850> actually<00:03:32.060> work

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
interesting this should actually work

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.780 
interesting this should actually work
with<00:03:32.600> most<00:03:32.840> quad<00:03:33.110> copters<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
with most quad copters that have the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.490 
with most quad copters that have the
flip<00:03:34.970> feature<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.510> thanks<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.050> for<00:03:42.290> whoever

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
flip feature so thanks again for whoever

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.930 
flip feature so thanks again for whoever
shared<00:03:42.740> I<00:03:42.890> forgot<00:03:43.220> who<00:03:43.340> shared<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:43.880> me

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
shared I forgot who shared that with me

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.970 
shared I forgot who shared that with me
I'm<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.360> sorry<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:47.270> yes<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.410> does<00:03:48.680> this

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
I'm so sorry but yes this does this

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.650 
I'm so sorry but yes this does this
feature<00:03:49.220> does<00:03:49.340> work<00:03:49.730> or<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.060> technique<00:03:50.420> does

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
feature does work or this technique does

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.730 
feature does work or this technique does
work<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:53.020> from<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.140> Menem<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.620> the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
work just from the Menem of the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.500 
work just from the Menem of the
quadcopter<00:03:54.980> alone<00:03:55.520> we'll<00:03:55.730> do<00:03:55.880> multiple<00:03:56.300> flips

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
quadcopter alone we'll do multiple flips

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
quadcopter alone we'll do multiple flips
so<00:03:57.050> this<00:03:57.200> quadcopter<00:03:57.500> 101<00:03:59.320> again<00:04:00.320> give

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
so this quadcopter 101 again give

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.230 
so this quadcopter 101 again give
yourself<00:04:00.860> plenty<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.250> room<00:04:01.490> if<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.880> do<00:04:02.060> this

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
yourself plenty of room if you do this

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.070 
yourself plenty of room if you do this
and<00:04:03.910> don't<00:04:04.910> cry<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.210> me<00:04:05.300> if<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.600> crack<00:04:05.840> into

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
and don't cry to me if you crack into

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
and don't cry to me if you crack into
the<00:04:06.170> ground<00:04:06.380> cuz<00:04:06.620> there<00:04:06.800> is<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.950> good

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
the ground cuz there is a good

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.310 
the ground cuz there is a good
possibility<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.810> will<00:04:09.020> as<00:04:09.200> you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
possibility that it that you will as you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.700 
possibility that it that you will as you
saw<00:04:09.500> my<00:04:09.890> first<00:04:10.100> attempt<00:04:10.880> at<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.240> so<00:04:11.960> clark<00:04:12.590> up

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
saw my first attempt at it so clark up

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:22.030 
saw my first attempt at it so clark up
your<00:04:12.830> 101<00:04:13.220> signing<00:04:13.640> up<00:04:20.049> okay<00:04:21.080> out<00:04:21.859> of

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
your 101 signing up okay out of

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.640 
your 101 signing up okay out of
curiosity<00:04:22.250> i<00:04:23.020> want<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.080> see<00:04:24.200> if<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.410> trip

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
curiosity i want to see if this trip

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.580 
curiosity i want to see if this trip
will<00:04:24.830> also<00:04:25.070> work<00:04:25.220> for<00:04:25.280> my<00:04:25.520> c-max<00:04:25.910> 11<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:27.380> let's

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
will also work for my c-max 11 so let's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.270 
will also work for my c-max 11 so let's
set<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:27.980> give<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.310> some<00:04:28.460> altitude<00:04:30.190> send<00:04:31.190> it

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
set it up give it some altitude send it

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.920 
set it up give it some altitude send it
up<00:04:31.370> wind<00:04:31.610> into<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.940> out<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.510> give<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.780> some

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
up wind into the out and give it some

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.320 
up wind into the out and give it some
altitude<00:04:33.670> activating<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.760> flip<00:04:35.150> oh<00:04:37.180> yeah<00:04:38.180> it

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
altitude activating the flip oh yeah it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.810 
altitude activating the flip oh yeah it
works<00:04:38.510> for<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:38.810> too<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.340> enters<00:04:40.610> into

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
works for that too but it enters into

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.440 
works for that too but it enters into
vortex<00:04:41.240> ring<00:04:41.420> state<00:04:41.740> because<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.450> prop

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
vortex ring state because of the prop

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.240 
vortex ring state because of the prop
guards<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.170> as<00:04:45.320> its<00:04:45.500> dropping<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.070> give<00:04:46.160> it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
guards so as its dropping and give it

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.890 
guards so as its dropping and give it
some<00:04:46.460> give<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:46.850> some<00:04:46.970> for<00:04:47.180> pitch<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.660> get<00:04:47.810> out

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
some give it some for pitch to get out

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.290 
some give it some for pitch to get out
of<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.050> vortex<00:04:48.620> ring<00:04:49.010> state<00:04:50.650> going<00:04:51.650> up

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
of the vortex ring state going up

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.190 
of the vortex ring state going up
flipping<00:04:53.320> holy<00:04:54.320> moly<00:04:55.510> did<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.720> see<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> big

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
flipping holy moly did you see a big

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.310 
flipping holy moly did you see a big
tumble<00:04:57.500> let's<00:04:58.430> go<00:04:58.670> let's<00:04:59.570> try<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.900> again

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.290 

open

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
open

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.190 
open
it<00:05:06.300> does<00:05:06.630> about<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.930> half<00:05:07.140> dozen<00:05:07.350> flips<00:05:09.200> you

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
it does about a half dozen flips you

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.660 
it does about a half dozen flips you
need<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.380> lot<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.680> altitude<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.310> this<00:05:11.430> let's

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
need a lot of altitude to do this let's

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.220 
need a lot of altitude to do this let's
try<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.000> again<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.480> hope<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.960> coming

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
try that again I hope this is coming

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.620 
try that again I hope this is coming
through<00:05:13.380> on<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.650> video<00:05:14.210> that's<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.390> smoke

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
through on the video that's the smoke

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.490 
through on the video that's the smoke
collector<00:05:16.310> but<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.490> thing<00:05:17.730> tumbles<00:05:18.120> like<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
collector but that thing tumbles like a

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.780 
collector but that thing tumbles like a
tumble<00:05:19.500> bug<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:22.320> yes<00:05:22.560> this<00:05:22.800> works<00:05:23.010> for<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.520> guess

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
tumble bug so yes this works for I guess

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.370 
tumble bug so yes this works for I guess
for<00:05:23.970> all<00:05:24.000> quad<00:05:24.360> copters<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:24.930> have<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.110> flip

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
for all quad copters that have a flip

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.740 
for all quad copters that have a flip
feature<00:05:27.200> just<00:05:28.200> set<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.560> up<00:05:28.880> flip<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:29.910> and<00:05:30.210> cut

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
feature just set it up flip it and cut

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.440 
feature just set it up flip it and cut
the<00:05:30.780> throttle<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:32.490> then<00:05:32.790> turn<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.120> throttle

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
the throttle and then turn the throttle

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.140 
the throttle and then turn the throttle
on<00:05:33.540> halfway<00:05:33.930> down<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.380> drop<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.940> need<00:05:36.120> a

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
on halfway down in the drop you need a

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:44.450 
on halfway down in the drop you need a
lot<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.450> altitude<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:36.930> do<00:05:37.050> it

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.440 

so<00:05:45.460> yes<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.750> works<00:05:47.020> for<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:47.980> x11<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.550> assume

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
so yes this works for the x11 I assume

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.930 
so yes this works for the x11 I assume
it<00:05:49.600> does<00:05:49.810> work<00:05:50.020> for<00:05:50.230> all<00:05:50.500> quad<00:05:50.830> copters<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:51.910> I

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
it does work for all quad copters so I

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.070 
it does work for all quad copters so I
hope<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.360> enjoyed<00:05:52.660> this<00:05:55.290> quadcopter<00:05:56.290> 101

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
hope you enjoyed this quadcopter 101

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.080 
hope you enjoyed this quadcopter 101
