00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
and a mouse it's like the difference

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.200 
and a mouse it's like the difference
between<00:00:07.379> using<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:08.069> paintbrush<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:08.940> a

photography<00:00:17.430> concentrate<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> tablet

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
photography concentrate so what a tablet

photography concentrate so what a tablet
is<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:21.029> device<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.439> lets<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
is is a device like this that lets you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
is is a device like this that lets you
use<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.160> pen<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.000> control<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> cursor<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
use a pen to control the cursor on your

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
use a pen to control the cursor on your
computer<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> awesome<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
computer and this is awesome for a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
computer and this is awesome for a
couple<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.810> reasons<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.849> very

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
couple of reasons first off it is very

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
couple of reasons first off it is very
precise<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.130> use<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.149> motions<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
precise you can use all the motions of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.020 
precise you can use all the motions of
your<00:00:33.660> hand<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.040> gives<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> way<00:00:35.790> better

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
your hand and that gives you way better

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
your hand and that gives you way better
control<00:00:36.570> versus<00:00:37.579> using<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.700> mouse<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.300> your

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
control versus using a mouse or your

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.130 
control versus using a mouse or your
finger<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> trackpad<00:00:41.600> another<00:00:42.600> reason<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
finger or the trackpad another reason is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
finger or the trackpad another reason is
that<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.550> nifty<00:00:44.789> pen

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that this is actually a very nifty pen

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.690 
that this is actually a very nifty pen
it<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.870> pressure<00:00:46.140> sensitive<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:47.219> means<00:00:47.460> if

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it is pressure sensitive which means if

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.470 
it is pressure sensitive which means if
I<00:00:47.789> push<00:00:48.090> hard<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:49.190> soft<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I push hard or soft I'm going to get a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
I push hard or soft I'm going to get a
different<00:00:51.750> result<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.129> editing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different result and when you're editing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
different result and when you're editing
your<00:00:53.789> photos<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.270> doing<00:00:54.510> retouching<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
your photos are doing retouching that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.299 
your photos are doing retouching that
gives<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.149> great<00:00:57.420> control

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
gives you some really great control

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
gives you some really great control
let's<00:00:59.309> take<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> second<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
let's take a second and see how this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
let's take a second and see how this
tool<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.399> useful<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:03.059> both

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
tool can be really useful in both

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
tool can be really useful in both
Lightroom<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.049> Photoshop<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:06.470> first<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.619> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
Lightroom and Photoshop now first I have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
Lightroom and Photoshop now first I have
Lightroom<00:01:08.189> open<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.420> going

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
Lightroom open here and what I'm going

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.950 
Lightroom open here and what I'm going
to<00:01:09.630> use<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> brush<00:01:10.770> tool<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.570> can<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to use is the brush tool you can see it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480 
to use is the brush tool you can see it
over<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> brush<00:01:14.189> tool

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
over here on the right the brush tool

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.410 
over here on the right the brush tool
and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.299> exposure<00:01:15.830> increase<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
and I have an exposure increase here of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
and I have an exposure increase here of
0.72<00:01:18.420> basically<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.770> make

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
0.72 basically I'm just going to make

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
0.72 basically I'm just going to make
things<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.369> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.850> brighter<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.780> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
things a little bit brighter and you can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
things a little bit brighter and you can
see<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.590> brush<00:01:23.009> makes<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.670> easy

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
see how the brush makes this really easy

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
see how the brush makes this really easy
so<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> brighten<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.380> face<00:01:25.710> here

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so I'm going to brighten my face here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
so I'm going to brighten my face here
and<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.610> quickly<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.150> paint<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and just really quickly just paint that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
and just really quickly just paint that
on<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:29.040> maybe<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.430> strong<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
on it's maybe a little strong but that's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
on it's maybe a little strong but that's
okay<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.930> fix<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.590> later<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.970> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
okay I can fix that later and you can
see<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.420> quickly<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.409> easy<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.740> me

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
see really quickly that was easy for me

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.969 
see really quickly that was easy for me
to<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> show<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to do now I'm going to show you the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
to do now I'm going to show you the
pressure<00:01:38.280> sensitivity<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:40.079> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
pressure sensitivity here because this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
pressure sensitivity here because this
is<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:41.159> makes<00:01:41.310> dodging<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> burning

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
is what really makes dodging and burning

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.929 
is what really makes dodging and burning
your<00:01:42.509> photos<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.369> nice<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
your photos really really nice with a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
your photos really really nice with a
tablet<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> press<00:01:46.770> really

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
tablet so I'm going to press really

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.510 
tablet so I'm going to press really
lightly<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.220> there

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
lightly here and you can see it's there

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
lightly here and you can see it's there
but<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:50.880> quite<00:01:51.180> faint<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.530> going

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
but it's quite faint and now I'm going

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.240 
but it's quite faint and now I'm going
to<00:01:52.680> press<00:01:52.979> hard<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.680> darker<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
to press hard and it's much darker and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.639 
to press hard and it's much darker and
that<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> give<00:01:57.750> me<00:01:57.899> fine-tuned

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that is going to give me fine-tuned

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.399 
that is going to give me fine-tuned
control<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.850> around<00:02:00.409> brightening

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
control as I go around brightening

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.940 
control as I go around brightening

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
so now the pressure sensitivity is

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.009 
so now the pressure sensitivity is
better<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:17.159> have<00:03:17.400> multi-touch<00:03:18.209> gestures<00:03:18.810> so
