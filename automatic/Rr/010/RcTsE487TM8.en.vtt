00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.929
 ah 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.730
 hi how about how are all my name 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.300
 is a porter and well this is the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.040
 axtel tv decoder that 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.590
 we found in the back good 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:31.099
 we found entrance tickets of rsa entrance 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.290
 HDMI and the input of the ethernet cable 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.160
 since this television system is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.800
 connect via internet is a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 decoder pretty small I'm going 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.109
 to show more or less an idea so that 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.010
 can you give is very small 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.010
 but very powerful 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.230
 well it came at the time of showing you the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.440
 remote control that axtel tv offers you is 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.380
 a very nice control aesthetically is 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.330
 a very thin remote control is a 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.730
 Remote control that allows you to control 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.800
 your television very independently of 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.650
 control the decoder both 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.470
 appliances in a single control is extremely 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.190
 thin I insist it's pretty thin and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.650
 very good axel tv provides you with a manual 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.229
 milestone that is put in control which 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.479
 I show it to you in a moment so that you 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.550
 you get familiar with the buttons 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.860
 with each function it's pretty good it's 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.110
 a very good option of axtel tv because 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.759
 while you learn them so that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.170
 this works so that the other one because already 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.170
 you have how to see it there 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.320
 well now we enter what is the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.030
 television as future see on screen 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.650
 we have channel 2 that is on high 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 definition looks pretty good 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.080
 currently in the city of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.810
 aguascalientes there are few channels in high 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.210
 definition what is not like in other 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.670
 cities like in Mexico that all the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 locals are in high definition here 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.160
 At the moment, they are very few 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.039
 23 maximum 4 channels in high definition 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.080
 which are the ones we can find but 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.110
 this does not mean that subsequently 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120
 do not add them we can count 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.530
 with information from the channel that is 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160
 watching as in this case the fox channel 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.860
 shows us a synopsis of what is the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.020
 time etc. 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.910
 we also have a small advantage 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.280
 that we can display where it shows 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 also a synopsis the time when 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.050
 When the program starts ending 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.300
 and with the little arrows going to the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.620
 right we can see 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.659
 the following programs that will happen 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.909
 there is also an interactive guide 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.379
 full showing all the channels 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.379
 schedules and so on 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.850
 I love you too good comment that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.990
 You can change the language to English 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 Spanish or vice versa 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.220
 your default configuration all 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.070
 programs are going to be in your language 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.590
 native who would be English 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.600
 if you can change the language very simple 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.770
 very easy very fast as seen in the 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.840
 screen 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.970
 that would be program by program and every 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.620
 time we go back to the channel or you can go 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.980
 directly to the options of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.770
 configuration and configure the audio to 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.490
 that if you think you visited the house 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.330
 last time 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:36.150
 the truth that you are watching a program 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.990
 you touch the door you can pause that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.960
 program and open see what happens you come back 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.930
 from that play and continue where you 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.250
 you stayed without any problem you continue 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.230
 watching the program also has the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.900
 option so I'm change the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.020
 channel 5 and that program is already started 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.790
 I can return that program from the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.190
 start with this option that says subtract 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.500
 you can restore it until the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.990
 start and see the full program 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.970
 again without the problems or return 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.710
 again to supervision is normal and 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.070
 but this is precisely what 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.930
 they do tb call television without schedules 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.540
 because practically without schedules you 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.690
 you can return it to slow it down 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.270
 to use it has the option also of 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.310
 record it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.860
 record multiple programs at once 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.050
 same time you have me there for a while 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.840
 It seems to be nothing more 30 or 90 days 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.580
 that let you have a recorded program 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.180
 but but it is very interesting and only 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.300
 you have very interesting that offers you 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.129
 obviously 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.300
 for example the virtual recorder 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:47.970
 you can only get it for free 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.330
 say it somehow if you hire the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.550
 ultra package otherwise as in my 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.530
 case that I have the basic package if I 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.169
 I would like the recorder to cost me 30 pesos 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.810
 more VAT to a total of 35 pesos more or 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.720
 less for having this system of 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.639
 virtual recording with 50 hours that is 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.469
 pretty or 50 times pretty 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.840
 and for example in the case of 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.629
 television without schedules is also a 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.509
 module that you have to hire this 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.539
 equal module costs you 30 pesos plus VAT 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.599
 monthly but I think it's worth it 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.189
 have this tv without schedules 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.789
 equally the recorder really the 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:30.889
 cost is not much and has the 80 as you 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.449
 I mention to record programs even from 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.340
 schedule programs so that you 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.930
 I recorded and you see it when you want and 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.289
 as many times as you want while not 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.270
 do not eliminate it or until the 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.270
 maintenance to the database where 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.750
 I imagine good also what it offers you 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.470
 this tv is a 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.570
 in movie theater you can not choose 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.650
 movies have a cost as an example 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.710
 there you can see the right side 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.390
 lower the cost of each film well 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.180
 that you can rent the you load your receipt 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.280
 and you have the option movies of 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.050
 all genres as it is action comedy 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.729
 children drama terror and inclusive 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.009
 has adult channels 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.229
 movies for adults like which 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.460
 you can see there a little bit and you can see that 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.680
 the costs are quite high 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.770
 well I can also show you here in 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.469
 this sequence of images some of 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.659
 the channels of more or less as they look 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:35.419
 unfortunately good because the recording 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.249
 of what he would have wanted to be able to be 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.319
 the present to you but good 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:41.569
 also mention that the recorder 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:44.509
 virtual for me is one of the points of 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.069
 axtel tv that has a popcorn 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.080
 first place because of the cost that is 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.729
 quite accessible and secondly by the 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.469
 amount of options you have for 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.849
 to be able to use this recorder at its best 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.229
 active 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.050
 imagine you have to go on a trip 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.490
 and there is a program that you would like to see 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.669
 Well now you can do it with this 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.009
 option you can program that channel that 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.680
 has recorded at the time that it passes 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.240
 and seen is recorded but not only 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.090
 you can record a single program you can 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.400
 record several programs at the same time see them 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.100
 how many times do you want while you have it 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.500
 saved without having deleted it 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.380
 and good to end with this one 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.490
 very personal opinion of this system of 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.500
 axtel television 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.900
 the only thing I can say that works 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.930
 pretty good so far I have not had 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.180
 no problem channels 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.340
 standard they look they look good I say there 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.229
 one or another that does not look good 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.660
 example of 7 to my life I liked a 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.770
 little bit more of quality the aztec dt but 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.629
 good 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.629
 generally pretty good
