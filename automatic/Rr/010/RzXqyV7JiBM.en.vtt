00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.980
 and the next one we're going to now place the set pieces of the centerline the 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.519
 corners that we lack 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.019
 and we're going to place it from the back then if we the first 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.409
 career we have chosen this case is the white 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.519
 we look at the back the back is the yellow with which we go 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.269
 to look for which these pieces do not have yellow 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.490
 because it is the one that we are going to place in the center 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.930
 we reviewed this yellow field in the meridian performance expenses the red-green 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.749
 let's place is in its place 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.129
 When we locate the piece, the first thing we have to do is like 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.739
 mysticism the steps before is to place it on your face worth 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 the white the red to put it on the red 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.690
 and so 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.390
 now what we have to look at is what is we have under the afternoon with what 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.589
 which validates this corner to the corner 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.900
 red to throw 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 so if we put it in front 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.730
 we have to do the 100 that we are going to do is always the same movement with 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 each of the chips what we have is to put it in your carotid and stuff 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 this movement printed that coca 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.950
 and this red and green case from here what we have to do is throw in the towel 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.740
 in the opposite direction it is worth silver trust here 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.530
 two others by dodging it in the opposite direction and lower the truth 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.550
 and something cloudy and put it in its place 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.750
 the plant is also your psyche 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.180
 and as a bonus that is not badly placed 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.710
 and like the previous movements we put the white face of 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.870
 front 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.860
 we work we bring the corner places it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 palin in this way we have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 the green and red placed 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.220
 let's find another one in the face behind we look at this aunt mary llorens peking 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.930
 yellow this has no one else is already placed to the shugur on his face is worth 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.400
 stop green orange in this case the green that is the right is worth it 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 that piece 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.180
 Well, we turn it in the opposite direction 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.950
 we turn the green face 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.730
 already put back in place 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.100
 I am not with white weapon riva pillar we have here the white 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.120
 front 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.870
 we go down we bring the corner we go up we recognize 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.959
 we wait 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.209
 another red 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.859
 we go to the programs yellow yellow yellow melilla is worth in this case not 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.259
 we have no part below 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.259
 then they have to be wrong what happens is that they are 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.969
 misplaced that we do by removing them we simply take them out we put them in 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.569
 the bottom part there was light the same method that you will not take to get them out 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.379
 it's the same movement that you just made now 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.799
 if you want to do if in the 21st century what we do not have our style gives us 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.449
 same 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.289
 why 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.700
 the help we have here is going to go 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.910
 for this site that is the malice and then this we will have work 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.989
 we are not going to put in your site and then 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.789
 we upload it 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.179
 we all work and make success to the right shoe 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.429
 and I go crazy we go up 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.429
 - table we go down we are in front 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.869
 and in this way what we have here below the attack and see 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.149
 if now is the back that is what interests us worth 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.299
 U.S 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.539
 we put 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.539
 the blue 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.639
 tinelli 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.899
 well the 'red' in this corner 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:23.069
 then what we go backwards we do to the right we go down this 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
 task and we're going to put it in its place and its white woman 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.729
 we look at the white one in front 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.649
 we go down we bring the corner and its time 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.369
 and the current 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.149
 of the basket placed bag we look again because we have removed the before 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.149
 that yes we have it here loose does not have yellow 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:42.929
 we put 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.959
 orange decks 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.879
 well the weir things on the other side do here 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.399
 we go down 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.269
 let's take it again we write 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.449
 in this way 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.109
 with the banque de france we go down 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.109
 we put in your site 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.349
 and so we have managed to have the white house and the first two lines 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.849
 formed vale 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.709
 let's make another example 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.629
 it's clear that it's like the one we've had right now that we've got 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:09.510
 to form 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.619
 the three corners but 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.539
 we have a well placed 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.229
 but poorly positioned 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.229
 in fact under we have all the yellow 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.149
 we do the same as before we took it out to put back 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.560
 so 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.350
 we rotate and choose the right 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.610
 we go down 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.360
 we put this back in principle 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.409
 and we suffer 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.270
 iara we place this physical campus we go down the corner we climb the 

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.259
 we place 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.259
 but now we look for work 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.870
 red and green we put on the red face 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.210
 towards the green that satiate stellar cole 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.099
 green for teams then the opposite direction we lower this face 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.270
 already coruÃ±a with the principle and themselves 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.909
 we look for variants 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.319
 let's take 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.009
 we assume that coca 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.210
 this way 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.479
 we will see well placed what we have done if we take it out 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.479
 and put it back 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.279
 among others 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.199
 read let's start looking 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.350
 I thought that they do not have yellow percent, in this case we have two 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.960
 we choose this amber region will allocate 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.639
 we place it in the possession 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.430
 this orange house 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.439
 with which contrary sense 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.669
 we go down 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 and we put deficit and pib or backs of his throat 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.849
 the different brand went down the corner 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.349
 giselle 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.740
 and we put it in front, it's worth 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.740
 we look at the back we look for another one will have to say 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.449
 to put on your orange and blue face the blue is here a message to 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.330
 right they go down a lot 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.270
 and bring us 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.680
 to the front and then the facts of Spain 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.139
 I'm excited by the white fabric irc low shows in the corner we went up and 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:58.909
 we place 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.430
 this way that we now have well placed 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.500
 we look for another 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.440
 the red and green that we have already placed lagarde is on this side 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.510
 so 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.849
 to the other side 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:08.860
 we go down 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.110
 and we put it 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.689
 and we go back up 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.219
 talk grows box we show the machines we go up 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.349
 she is placed 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.830
 both seek other 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.309
 red and blue we place in the red 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:26.669
 in this case from brazil to this side 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.050
 then then to the opposite side matzkin 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.770
 we lowered the jail 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.770
 and the evolution of the spindles and reposition is up 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.900
 The bench 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.189
 head on 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.369
 low showing that the corner 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:42.610
 and themselves 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.710
 this colon mode you see the white face the two lines 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.070
 and this case is already finished
