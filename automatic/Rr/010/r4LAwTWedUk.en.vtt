I<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.720> weavers<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.680> think<00:03:05.890> Weaver's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
I do this but weavers I think Weaver's

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.789 
I do this but weavers I think Weaver's
and<00:03:06.340> fabric<00:03:06.970> workers<00:03:07.330> have<00:03:07.570> more<00:03:07.870> wooden<00:03:08.560> wear

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
and fabric workers have more wooden wear

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.340 
and fabric workers have more wooden wear
associated<00:03:09.489> with<00:03:09.640> their<00:03:09.850> trade<00:03:10.239> than<00:03:10.840> about

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
associated with their trade than about
