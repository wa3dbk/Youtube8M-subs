00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:16.989 
and all that so I think in the end in

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:21.419 
and all that so I think in the end in
total<00:05:17.989> I<00:05:18.649> think<00:05:19.219> it<00:05:19.339> values<00:05:19.969> that<00:05:20.119> about<00:05:20.449> I

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:21.429 
total I think it values that about I

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:29.829 
total I think it values that about I
want<00:05:22.429> to<00:05:22.489> say<00:05:23.679> 25<00:05:24.679> to<00:05:25.339> 30<00:05:26.179> mil<00:05:26.839> or<00:05:27.259> so<00:05:28.809> but<00:05:29.809> I

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
want to say 25 to 30 mil or so but I

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.540 
want to say 25 to 30 mil or so but I
think<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:30.169> a<00:05:30.259> little<00:05:30.379> bit<00:05:30.529> closer<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.099> 30

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
think it's a little bit closer to 30

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.389 
think it's a little bit closer to 30
than<00:05:31.669> it<00:05:31.909> is<00:05:32.029> 25<00:05:34.599> cuz<00:05:35.599> 19<00:05:36.080> mil<00:05:36.289> and<00:05:36.919> then<00:05:37.069> we<00:05:37.189> got

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:37.399 
than it is 25 cuz 19 mil and then we got

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.070 
than it is 25 cuz 19 mil and then we got
like<00:05:38.229> how<00:05:39.229> much<00:05:39.589> this<00:05:39.769> is<00:05:39.830> six<00:05:40.339> mil<00:05:40.550> together

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
like how much this is six mil together

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.129 
like how much this is six mil together
than<00:05:42.080> all<00:05:42.199> the<00:05:42.319> other<00:05:42.439> items<00:05:43.899> so<00:05:44.899> yeah<00:05:45.019> I<00:05:45.050> think

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
than all the other items so yeah I think

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.059 
than all the other items so yeah I think
it's<00:05:45.409> pretty<00:05:45.529> close<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.979> 30<00:05:46.669> mil<00:05:47.349> which<00:05:48.349> is

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
it's pretty close to 30 mil which is

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.709 
it's pretty close to 30 mil which is
almost<00:05:49.339> double<00:05:49.669> what<00:05:49.849> it<00:05:49.969> wasn't<00:05:50.269> last<00:05:50.419> one

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
almost double what it wasn't last one

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.649 
almost double what it wasn't last one
with<00:05:50.839> the<00:05:50.959> prices<00:05:51.349> then<00:05:52.119> so<00:05:53.119> I<00:05:53.149> think<00:05:53.300> I've<00:05:53.629> a

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
with the prices then so I think I've a

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.889 
with the prices then so I think I've a
and<00:05:54.259> my<00:05:54.469> total<00:05:54.740> level<00:05:54.889> increased<00:05:55.369> about<00:05:56.029> 20<00:05:56.779> or

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 
and my total level increased about 20 or

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.219 
and my total level increased about 20 or
30<00:05:57.110> levels<00:05:57.469> since<00:05:57.649> the<00:05:57.800> last<00:05:57.979> video<00:05:59.169> so<00:06:00.169> i

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
30 levels since the last video so i

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.980 
30 levels since the last video so i
don't<00:06:00.439> know<00:06:00.499> i'm<00:06:00.789> pretty<00:06:01.789> happy<00:06:01.879> with<00:06:02.149> that
