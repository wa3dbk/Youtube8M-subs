problem right well actually the reason

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
problem right well actually the reason
they<00:01:02.039> say<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.940> any<00:01:03.120> residue

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
they say that because if any residue

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
they say that because if any residue
gets<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.500> harmful<00:01:05.040> right<00:01:05.670> now

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
gets in there it's not harmful right now

gets in there it's not harmful right now
look<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.780> situation<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> we've<00:01:07.680> got

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
look at the situation that we've got

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
look at the situation that we've got
these<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> guide<00:01:08.670> rails<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
these are you guide rails and they are a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.670 
these are you guide rails and they are a
plastic<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.360> plastic<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.570> polymer<00:01:13.140> compound

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
plastic or plastic like polymer compound

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
plastic or plastic like polymer compound
and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.340> there's<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.909> stainless

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and then there's all this stainless

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
and then there's all this stainless
black<00:01:15.780> steel<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> stay<00:01:17.250> clean

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
black steel that we want to stay clean

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.230 
are the less those fibers are gonna
stick<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.649> years<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690

actually<00:02:50.700> by<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.120> wheel<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.290> rotate

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
actually by this wheel so you can rotate

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.400 
actually by this wheel so you can rotate
the<00:02:52.890> wheel<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.940> listen<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.750> sometimes

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the wheel and listen to that sometimes

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.100 
the wheel and listen to that sometimes
it's<00:02:55.799> very<00:02:55.980> quiet<00:02:56.250> okay<00:02:56.970> all<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> way<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> one

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
it's very quiet okay all the way to one

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.920 
it's very quiet okay all the way to one
side<00:02:58.140> give<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> little<00:02:59.069> squirt<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.720> is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
side give it a little squirt and this is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
side give it a little squirt and this is
maintenance<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.590> do<00:03:01.799> every<00:03:02.580> few<00:03:02.790> times<00:03:03.090> when

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
maintenance you do every few times when

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.729 
maintenance you do every few times when
you<00:03:03.540> use<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.110> machine

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
you use the machine

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.640 
you use the machine
now<00:03:05.100> your<00:03:05.340> strippers<00:03:06.090> move<00:03:06.780> up<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.200> down<00:03:07.350> as

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
now your strippers move up and down as

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
now your strippers move up and down as
it<00:03:07.830> goes<00:03:07.860> apart<00:03:08.370> your<00:03:08.489> stripper<00:03:08.819> holders<00:03:09.239> so

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it goes apart your stripper holders so

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
it goes apart your stripper holders so
again<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.830> side<00:03:11.130> give<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.760> squirt

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
again this side give it a little squirt

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.720 
again this side give it a little squirt
now<00:03:13.019> what<00:03:13.290> will<00:03:13.410> happen<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.950> use<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> little<00:03:14.579> bit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
now what will happen is use a little bit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.900 
now what will happen is use a little bit
of<00:03:14.850> waste<00:03:15.120> yarn<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:16.440> be<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:17.640> your<00:03:17.820> initial<00:03:18.150> use

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
of waste yarn to be on your initial use

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.370 
of waste yarn to be on your initial use

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.590 
because as you turn it up I'm seeing
quite<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> bit<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.890> fuzz<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.400> there<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:03.299> and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
quite a bit of fuzz in there right and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.330 
quite a bit of fuzz in there right and
it<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.019> will<00:04:04.109> need<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.410> flip<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.920> up<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:05.280> you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
it you will need to flip it up so you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.840 
it you will need to flip it up so you
can<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.980> get<00:04:08.130> these<00:04:08.370> at<00:04:08.700> all

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
can see this is you can get these at all

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.539 
can see this is you can get these at all
kinds<00:04:09.359> of<00:04:09.450> yard<00:04:10.170> sales<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.680> garage<00:04:11.010> harbor

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
kinds of yard sales and garage harbor

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.520 
kinds of yard sales and garage harbor
Frank<00:04:11.880> carry<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.510> line<00:04:12.720> they're<00:04:13.109> not<00:04:13.139> right

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
Frank carry the line they're not right

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.620 
Frank carry the line they're not right
as<00:04:13.650> nice<00:04:13.829> as<00:04:14.040> yours<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.489> they'll<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.880> but

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
as nice as yours but they'll do it but

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.080 
as nice as yours but they'll do it but
yeah<00:04:15.870> all<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:16.560> is<00:04:16.829> go<00:04:17.100> through

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
yeah all you do is go through

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.710 
yeah all you do is go through
you<00:04:18.239> can<00:04:18.480> see<00:04:18.840> let<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:19.709> hold<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.220> second

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
you can see let me hold it a second

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.600 
you can see let me hold it a second
there's<00:04:21.720> quite<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> bit<00:04:22.650> no<00:04:22.860> leave<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.370> leans

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
there's quite a bit no leave it leans

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.320 
there's quite a bit no leave it leans
that<00:04:23.940> way

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that way

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.240 
that way
there's<00:04:24.930> quite<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.230> bit<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> come<00:04:25.800> out<00:04:25.980> from

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
there's quite a bit to come out from

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.620 
there's quite a bit to come out from
here<00:04:26.490> see<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:26.880> coming<00:04:27.210> up<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.300> that

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
here see it coming up and I think that

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.540 
here see it coming up and I think that
we<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.020> decided<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.010> dental<00:04:32.310> pick

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
we have decided we like the dental pick

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.550 
we have decided we like the dental pick
better<00:04:32.850> than<00:04:33.180> other<00:04:33.389> kinds<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.930> combing<00:04:34.380> out

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
better than other kinds of combing out

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.250 
better than other kinds of combing out
because<00:04:34.889> it<00:04:35.100> doesn't<00:04:36.030> stress<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.780> bristles

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
because it doesn't stress the bristles

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.230 
because it doesn't stress the bristles
very<00:04:37.440> much<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.130> pulls<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.760> fibers

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
very much and it pulls out the fibers

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.790 
very much and it pulls out the fibers
very<00:04:39.570> nicely<00:04:40.460> there<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.550> goes<00:04:41.990> yeah<00:04:42.990> what<00:04:43.620> just

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
very nicely there it goes yeah what just

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.920 
very nicely there it goes yeah what just
takes<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.220> minute<00:04:44.400> yeah<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:44.940> want<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.449> get<00:04:45.630> into

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
takes a minute yeah you want to get into

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.469 
takes a minute yeah you want to get into
the<00:04:46.260> base<00:04:46.530> look<00:04:47.280> right<00:04:47.490> here<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.790> can<00:04:47.970> see<00:04:48.270> at

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
the base look right here you can see at

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.810 
the base look right here you can see at
the<00:04:48.660> base<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.380> brush<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.919> where<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
the base of the brush is where the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.420 
the base of the brush is where the
compacted<00:04:51.510> fibers<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.190> want

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
compacted fibers get and you just want

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.730 
compacted fibers get and you just want
to<00:04:53.490> brush<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.210> then<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.110> call<00:04:55.530> them<00:04:55.590> out

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
to brush it and then you call them out

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.920 
to brush it and then you call them out
with<00:04:55.889> your<00:04:55.950> fingertips<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:57.150> loosen<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.750> up

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
with your fingertips and loosen it up

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.320 
with your fingertips and loosen it up
and<00:04:58.290> then<00:04:58.440> it'll<00:04:58.620> come<00:04:58.710> out<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.370> little<00:05:00.000> fiber

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and then it'll come out a little fiber

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.420 
and then it'll come out a little fiber
in<00:05:00.600> there<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:00.960> not<00:05:01.200> ruining<00:05:01.710> anything<00:05:01.860> but

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
in there is not ruining anything but

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.950 
in there is not ruining anything but
gradually<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.180> brush<00:05:03.450> will<00:05:03.690> cease<00:05:03.930> to

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
gradually the brush will cease to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080 
gradually the brush will cease to
perform<00:05:04.560> its<00:05:04.710> function<00:05:05.250> if<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:05.610> got<00:05:05.880> too

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
perform its function if it's got too

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.310 
perform its function if it's got too
much<00:05:06.120> well<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.320> again<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:09.720> mentioned<00:05:10.200> this

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
much well and again you mentioned this

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.520 
much well and again you mentioned this
is<00:05:10.530> not<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.740> new<00:05:11.130> machine<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.750> means<00:05:13.020> for

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
is not a new machine so that means for

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.150 
is not a new machine so that means for
years<00:05:14.210> for<00:05:15.210> years<00:05:15.270> an<00:05:15.900> oil<00:05:16.169> type<00:05:16.500> lubricant

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
years for years an oil type lubricant

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.800 
years for years an oil type lubricant
was<00:05:17.340> used<00:05:17.729> because<00:05:18.210> that's<00:05:18.419> what<00:05:18.630> was

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
was used because that's what was

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.040 
was used because that's what was
recommended<00:05:19.560> all<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.729> our<00:05:20.880> products<00:05:21.449> I<00:05:21.630> mean

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
recommended all of our products I mean

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.430 
recommended all of our products I mean
our<00:05:22.530> silicon<00:05:23.220> base<00:05:23.490> tips<00:05:24.030> which<00:05:24.630> means<00:05:24.990> that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
our silicon base tips which means that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.980 
our silicon base tips which means that
over<00:05:25.680> years<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.669> molecule<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.419> not<00:05:27.630> going<00:05:27.900> to

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
over years that molecule is not going to

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.040 
over years that molecule is not going to
break<00:05:28.169> down<00:05:28.340> see<00:05:29.340> with<00:05:29.580> your<00:05:29.729> brushes<00:05:30.330> they

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
break down see with your brushes they

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.600 
break down see with your brushes they
pick<00:05:31.289> up<00:05:31.470> some<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.860> oil<00:05:32.280> based

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
pick up some of that oil based

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.089 
pick up some of that oil based
lubrication<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:33.960> gets<00:05:34.200> compacted<00:05:34.620> at<00:05:34.979> the

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
lubrication it gets compacted at the

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.219 
lubrication it gets compacted at the
base<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.669> brush<00:05:35.910> that's<00:05:36.660> one<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.139> the

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
base of the brush that's one of the

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.170 
base of the brush that's one of the
things<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.650> causes<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.370> bristles<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:38.970> come

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
things that causes the bristles to come

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.390 
things that causes the bristles to come
loose<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.539> we<00:05:39.690> all<00:05:39.870> try<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.620> get<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:41.070> where

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
loose and we all try not to get it where

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.339 
loose and we all try not to get it where
the<00:05:41.520> brushes<00:05:41.910> can<00:05:42.090> get<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.389> but<00:05:42.539> eventually<00:05:42.660> it

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
the brushes can get it but eventually it

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.350 
the brushes can get it but eventually it
moves<00:05:43.590> around<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:44.010> little<00:05:44.130> I've<00:05:44.820> got<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.090> lot

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
moves around a little I've got a lot

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.290 
moves around a little I've got a lot
more<00:05:45.389> work<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:46.020> do<00:05:46.200> there<00:05:46.410> off-camera<00:05:47.270> but<00:05:48.270> I

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
more work to do there off-camera but I

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.240 
more work to do there off-camera but I
think<00:05:48.690> we<00:05:48.840> get<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.050> idea<00:05:49.530> right<00:05:51.710> what<00:05:52.710> we<00:05:52.919> just

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
think we get the idea right what we just

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.420 
think we get the idea right what we just
discussed<00:05:53.849> was<00:05:54.240> getting<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.349> oil<00:05:55.380> out<00:05:56.070> the

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
discussed was getting the oil out the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.879 
discussed was getting the oil out the
old<00:05:56.610> oil<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.810> oil<00:05:57.840> products<00:05:58.530> out<00:05:58.740> of

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
old oil and the oil products out of

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.890 
old oil and the oil products out of
there<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.130> putting<00:05:59.310> silicon<00:05:59.880> products<00:06:00.330> in<00:06:00.630> to

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
there and putting silicon products in to

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.120 
there and putting silicon products in to
lubricate<00:06:01.320> your<00:06:01.380> lungs

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
lubricate your lungs

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.990 
lubricate your lungs
now<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:03.210> also<00:06:03.870> use<00:06:04.349> in<00:06:04.560> my<00:06:04.710> process<00:06:05.070> Marvel

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
now I also use in my process Marvel

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.159 
now I also use in my process Marvel
Mystery<00:06:06.389> Oil<00:06:06.660> in<00:06:07.560> my<00:06:07.740> deep<00:06:08.010> soap<00:06:08.419> however<00:06:09.419> once

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
Mystery Oil in my deep soap however once

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.560 
Mystery Oil in my deep soap however once
I<00:06:10.349> get<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.680> out<00:06:10.800> of<00:06:10.979> the<00:06:11.070> soaking<00:06:11.520> bath<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:12.120> do

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
I get it out of the soaking bath I do

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.779 
I get it out of the soaking bath I do
exactly<00:06:13.139> what<00:06:13.560> we<00:06:13.680> did<00:06:13.860> in<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.130> videos<00:06:14.520> I

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
exactly what we did in the videos I

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.810 
exactly what we did in the videos I
cleanse<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.690> oil<00:06:15.930> out<00:06:16.229> put<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.039> silicon<00:06:17.520> in

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
cleanse the oil out put the silicon in

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.150 
cleanse the oil out put the silicon in
so<00:06:18.389> when<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.690> get<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:18.960> machine<00:06:19.320> back<00:06:19.650> for<00:06:19.979> me

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
so when you get a machine back for me

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.190 
so when you get a machine back for me
that's<00:06:20.639> what<00:06:20.849> you're<00:06:21.000> gonna<00:06:21.120> get<00:06:21.419> a<00:06:21.660> good

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
that's what you're gonna get a good

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.560 
that's what you're gonna get a good
silicon-based<00:06:22.889> lubricant<00:06:23.789> this<00:06:24.330> is

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
silicon-based lubricant this is

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.990 
silicon-based lubricant this is
something<00:06:25.050> that's<00:06:25.260> more<00:06:25.650> compatible<00:06:26.490> with

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
something that's more compatible with

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.099 
something that's more compatible with
the<00:06:27.210> fiber<00:06:27.419> arts<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.200> you're<00:06:28.469> practicing
