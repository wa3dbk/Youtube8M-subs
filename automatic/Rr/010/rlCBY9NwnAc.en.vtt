00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 welcome all viewers and subscribers 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.839
 Channel million Gaidar 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.730
 in this video i want to show you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.639
 a small chip with guitar pro 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.790
 about which, surprisingly, many do not know 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.609
 and it is very bad so this feature will help 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 save you a lot of time and I think 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 that she deserves this particular 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.529
 of the lesson and so what's the point do you know what 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.330
 in guitar pro 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 already built in all sorts of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.599
 types of din and access to them can be obtained and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 just a couple of clicks 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.880
 you do not need to search for the desired scale 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.980
 somewhere on the internet personally side just 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 watch the video to the end and everything will be 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 I will immediately warn you that you can 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.350
 bring this knowledge to any other 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 guitar pro version 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 but i'm showing on the fifth version so 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.590
 come to the point first thing you need 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 Where 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 Guitar fingerboard more precisely a button with a guitar 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 riff 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.300
 You will find the top panel 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 tools, look carefully and here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.379
 she button click on it lies something 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.260
 otherwise exactly how the guitar neck 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.710
 next tab tools and gam 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.860
 opens up 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 snark but also you see the tonality and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.010
 many different who probably even 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.690
 You will not find everything on the Internet and so 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.290
 choose the tonality on the camera for and 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.649
 any gamma meet you major 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 minor or pentatonic so by the way 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.850
 glued it gamma 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 click on the sweetheart on the tonic guitar 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 there was a bunch but actually it is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.950
 our pentatonic pit in the market for tonic 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.960
 all over the neck 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.010
 learn the most important things on health 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.460
 try to think bosses 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.549
 boxes are separate and so to speak 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.920
 fingering gamma that is not necessary to learn 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.159
 with a carpenter teacher in small portions 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:14.060
 for example, here is the first minor box 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:16.610
 pentatonics here second and so on if 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.130
 you don't know what gamma is and you 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 It is interesting to know why all this video and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.720
 Why not apply all these scales then 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.250
 watch this video to the end and in the very 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 You will see the end of this video tutorial. 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 link to the lesson while you study it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.709
 then come back here and maybe you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.400
 news 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.190
 understood but if you all knew it and 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 the information you had to taste 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.319
 in her appreciated and you do not connect recognized 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 wow, I didn't know what a guitar pro is from 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.390
 cool function now i will use 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.730
 This is exactly what you think now 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.920
 Like me it will be nice to know that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.920
 this video is really useful
