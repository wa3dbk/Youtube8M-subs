00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.170 
to go out on our date on our race bike
so<00:00:23.420> I<00:00:23.680> just<00:00:24.680> got<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.099> got<00:00:25.460> some<00:00:25.640> time<00:00:25.849> on<00:00:26.060> that

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
so I just got the got some time on that

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.920 
so I just got the got some time on that
thing<00:00:27.400> wouldn't<00:00:28.400> stand<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.700> lot<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:29.000> times<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:29.540> i

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
thing wouldn't stand a lot of times as i

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.470 
thing wouldn't stand a lot of times as i
did<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.560> other<00:00:30.980> biker<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:31.730> a<00:00:31.759> when<00:00:32.450> I

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
did with the other biker but a when I

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.689 
did with the other biker but a when I
went<00:00:32.840> out<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.080> sound<00:00:33.290> was<00:00:33.440> goat<00:00:33.710> was<00:00:34.010> was

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
went out the sound was goat was was

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.560 
went out the sound was goat was was
coming<00:00:35.180> down<00:00:35.330> so<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.879> conditions<00:00:38.360> were

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
coming down so the conditions were

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.759 
coming down so the conditions were
optimal<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.250> think<00:00:41.059> we<00:00:41.150> made<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.360> lot<00:00:41.629> of

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
optimal but I think we made a lot of

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.200 
optimal but I think we made a lot of
improvements<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:42.920> I<00:00:42.980> think<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:43.430> combate<00:00:43.970> hold

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
improvements and I think I combate hold

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.970 
improvements and I think I combate hold
on<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.629> do<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.809> little<00:00:45.050> bit<00:00:45.199> more<00:00:45.320> training<00:00:45.860> and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
on and do a little bit more training and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.340 
on and do a little bit more training and
i<00:00:46.100> think<00:00:46.370> i<00:00:46.790> think<00:00:47.210> when<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:47.629> get<00:00:48.050> out<00:00:48.170> of<00:00:48.260> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
i think i think when we get out of the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.140 
i think i think when we get out of the
first<00:00:48.800> practice<00:00:49.280> i<00:00:49.400> think<00:00:49.580> should<00:00:49.760> be<00:00:49.850> pretty

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
first practice i think should be pretty

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.899 
first practice i think should be pretty
good<00:00:50.440> can<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.530> tell<00:00:51.739> me<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:51.979> difference<00:00:52.519> in

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
good can you tell me the difference in

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.060 
good can you tell me the difference in
the<00:00:53.000> feeling<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.839> stock<00:00:54.110> motor<00:00:54.500> versus

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
the feeling of the stock motor versus

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.960 
the feeling of the stock motor versus
the<00:00:55.339> daytona<00:00:56.150> sportbike<00:00:56.930> spec<00:00:57.409> motor<00:00:57.970> the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
the daytona sportbike spec motor the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.210 
the daytona sportbike spec motor the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
a more power all the way through it was

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.750 
a more power all the way through it was
more<00:01:04.430> useful<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.380> other<00:01:06.920> bike<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
more useful that this the other bike you

I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> great<00:01:43.470> bike<00:01:44.030> there's<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
I think it's a great bike there's a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
I think it's a great bike there's a
there's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.910> lot<00:01:48.270> though<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.320> of

sudden you can change on it make it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.430

better so there there's there's so many

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.740 
better so there there's there's so many

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
components on it there there's a lot of
room<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.140> improvement<00:01:58.610> on<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.760> for<00:02:00.060> your

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
room for improvement on it for your

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
room for improvement on it for your
riding<00:02:00.570> style<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.830> think<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
riding style of some and I think and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000 
riding style of some and I think and
that's<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.580> great<00:02:02.880> bankas<00:02:03.590> everybody<00:02:04.590> talks

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
that's a great bankas everybody talks

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.910 
that's a great bankas everybody talks
about<00:02:05.840> when<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.960> change<00:02:07.260> bikes<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.740> gotta

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
about when they change bikes they gotta

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
about when they change bikes they gotta
adapt<00:02:08.220> their<00:02:08.490> riding<00:02:08.729> south<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.630> bike<00:02:09.899> but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
adapt their riding south to the bike but

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
adapt their riding south to the bike but
my<00:02:11.070> theory<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.850> should<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.390> able<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.230> adapt

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
my theory is you should be able to adapt

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.510 
my theory is you should be able to adapt
the<00:02:14.130> bike<00:02:14.340> tell<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.940> tell<00:02:15.660> your<00:02:16.020> tailor<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the bike tell your tell your tailor to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.910 
the bike tell your tell your tailor to
your<00:02:17.550> own<00:02:17.730> ride<00:02:18.420> style<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.380> that's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
your own ride style because that that's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.490 
your own ride style because that that's
how<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.550> ride<00:02:20.880> that's<00:02:21.120> how<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.960> where

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
how you ride that's how you got to where

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.230 
how you ride that's how you got to where
you<00:02:22.740> are<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.340> you're<00:02:23.520> gonna<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.000> change

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you are so you're gonna have to change

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.520 
you are so you're gonna have to change
your<00:02:24.330> ride<00:02:24.570> sell<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.950> biker<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:27.530> alright

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
your ride sell for the biker on alright

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.360 
your ride sell for the biker on alright
so<00:02:28.680> next<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:29.390> next<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> Daytona<00:02:32.010> Beach
