to enjoy deeply the ps2 version

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.029 
to enjoy deeply the ps2 version
obviously<00:01:27.369> because<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.960> less<00:01:29.289> memory<00:01:29.680> and

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
obviously because of a less memory and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.100

to do some tricks to get it working on
the<00:01:33.670> ps2<00:01:34.000> but<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> idea<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.930> map<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.320> as

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the ps2 but the idea is to map it as

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.430 
the ps2 but the idea is to map it as
closely<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.490> ps3<00:01:36.789> version<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:38.140> kind<00:01:38.380> of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
closely to the ps3 version we kind of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.380 
closely to the ps3 version we kind of
kicked<00:01:38.649> off<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.950> game<00:01:39.130> as<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.369> ps3<00:01:39.729> game<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
kicked off the game as a ps3 game that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.800

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
we put a lot of investment in time into

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.340 
we put a lot of investment in time into
the<00:01:51.190> platform<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.810> now<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.080> know<00:01:53.259> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the platform because now you know the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.620 
the platform because now you know the
game<00:01:53.500> looks<00:01:53.710> great<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.700> ps3<00:01:55.000> but

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
game looks great on the ps3 but

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.120 
game looks great on the ps3 but
somewhere<00:01:55.960> in<00:01:56.020> there<00:01:56.200> we<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.860> know<00:01:56.979> we

realized it made sense just to be on the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.130 
realized it made sense just to be on the
360<00:02:00.040> as<00:02:00.189> well<00:02:00.400> it's<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:01.030> great<00:02:01.150> machine<00:02:01.330> you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
360 as well it's a great machine you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.719 
360 as well it's a great machine you
know<00:02:02.259> it's<00:02:02.650> exciting<00:02:02.979> time<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.549> game

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
know it's exciting time to be a game

know it's exciting time to be a game
developer<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.180> go<00:02:04.270> what<00:02:04.420> powerful<00:02:04.869> hardware

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
developer you go what powerful hardware

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.870 
developer you go what powerful hardware
out<00:02:05.229> there<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.530> use<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.130> we<00:02:06.280> wanted<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.640> you

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
out there to use and we wanted to you

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.130 
out there to use and we wanted to you
know<00:02:06.909> see<00:02:07.240> what<00:02:07.360> we<00:02:07.450> could<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.689> with<00:02:07.869> both<00:02:08.110> of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
know see what we could do with both of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.050 
know see what we could do with both of
the<00:02:08.320> platforms<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.890> think<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.729> both

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the platforms and I think I think both

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.930 
the platforms and I think I think both
versions<00:02:10.329> of<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.690> game

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
versions of the game

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.850 
versions of the game
on<00:02:11.510> both<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.990> platforms<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.620> both<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
on both of the platforms on both the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680 
on both of the platforms on both the
next-gen<00:02:13.190> consoles<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:14.270> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> be<00:02:14.540> free

with<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.200> ps3<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.860> had<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> running<00:02:19.670> 360

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
with the ps3 we had a running 360

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.790 
with the ps3 we had a running 360
villain<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.900> background<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.470> probably

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
villain in the background it probably

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.410 
villain in the background it probably
was<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.100> feature<00:02:22.340> parity<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> ps3

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
was not a feature parity with the ps3

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.820 
was not a feature parity with the ps3
but<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.690> was<00:02:23.780> pretty<00:02:23.960> close<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.500> we've<00:02:24.680> been

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
but it was pretty close so we've been

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.800 
but it was pretty close so we've been
certainly<00:02:25.730> working<00:02:25.970> out<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> next<00:02:26.600> gen
