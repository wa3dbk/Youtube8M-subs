pieces<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.960> cut<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:50.960> drill<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> holes<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
pieces are cut I can drill the holes but

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.569 
pieces are cut I can drill the holes but
first<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.670> went<00:01:54.180> ahead<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> drew<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.079> lines<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
first I went ahead and drew the lines so

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.149 
first I went ahead and drew the lines so
this<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> me<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> center<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:58.159> center

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this is me the center of the one center

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.020 
this is me the center of the one center
of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> next<00:02:00.439> next<00:02:01.439> next<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of the next next next and then this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.800 
of the next next next and then this
where<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> 35<00:02:03.750> ends<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.799> extra

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
where the 35 ends this is just extra

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
where the 35 ends this is just extra
give<00:02:06.810> me<00:02:06.960> more<00:02:07.140> room<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.409> errors<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.280> such

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
give me more room for errors and such

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100 
give me more room for errors and such
which<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.270> shouldn't<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:10.050> I'm

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
which I shouldn't have because I'm

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.130 
which I shouldn't have because I'm
actually<00:02:10.289> doing<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.590> properly

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually doing this properly

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.559 
actually doing this properly
and<00:02:12.230> then<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.740> middle<00:02:12.950> here<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.569> center

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
and then the middle here is the center

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.199 
and then the middle here is the center
one<00:02:14.690> here<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.069> enough<00:02:16.370> room<00:02:16.850> for<00:02:17.120> an

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
one here I do have enough room for an

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.780 
one here I do have enough room for an
extra<00:02:17.270> speaker<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.459> think<00:02:19.459> it'd<00:02:19.550> just<00:02:19.640> be

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
extra speaker but I think it'd just be

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.220 
extra speaker but I think it'd just be
too<00:02:19.819> much<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:20.390> want<00:02:20.569> something<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.080> there

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
too much I just want something in there

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.660 
too much I just want something in there
so<00:02:21.410> it's<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.709> look<00:02:21.770> like<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.100> five<00:02:22.250> but

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so it's going to look like just five but

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.890 
so it's going to look like just five but
I'm<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.420> put<00:02:23.540> something<00:02:23.720> there

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
I'm going to put something there

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.600 
I'm going to put something there
probably<00:02:24.260> like<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> logo<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
probably like I have here a logo or a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.420 
probably like I have here a logo or a
light<00:02:26.000> probably<00:02:26.920> anyways<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.100> just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
light probably anyways now that just

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.730 
light probably anyways now that just
like<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:29.180> take<00:02:30.140> my<00:02:30.170> drill<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:32.740> drill

make it work because well it worked good
on<00:03:06.660> these<00:03:06.930> ones<00:03:07.200> where<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.370> thick<00:03:08.580> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
on these ones where it's really thick a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.740 
on these ones where it's really thick a
lot<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.880> support<00:03:09.380> but<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.530> these<00:03:10.709> thinner<00:03:11.010> ones

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.470 
to do with one hand so I'm just going to
take<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.170> off<00:03:52.410> real<00:03:52.680> quick<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:54.269> show<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
take this off real quick and show you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.600 
take this off real quick and show you
how<00:03:54.720> well<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:57.329> fits<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.739> fits<00:03:59.010> perfectly

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
how well that fits that fits perfectly

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.440 
how well that fits that fits perfectly
closer<00:04:02.610> there<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:05.090> look<00:04:06.090> how<00:04:06.209> nice<00:04:06.420> that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
closer there like look how nice that

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.229 
closer there like look how nice that
fits<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.410> focus<00:04:07.829> there<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.130> go<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:09.000> fits

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
fits now in focus there you go it fits

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.990 
fits now in focus there you go it fits
beautifully<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.190> bit<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.850> wiggle<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:14.640> it

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
beautifully just a bit of wiggle but it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.909 
beautifully just a bit of wiggle but it
still<00:04:15.299> gives<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.630> see<00:04:16.530> there's<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.829> bit

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
still gives you see there's a little bit

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.430 
still gives you see there's a little bit
of<00:04:17.040> wiggle<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:17.549> still<00:04:17.820> fits<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:19.260> only

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
of wiggle but still fits the only

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.760 
of wiggle but still fits the only
downside<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.030> because<00:04:21.030> with<00:04:21.209> my<00:04:21.359> bit<00:04:21.770> I'm

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
downside is because with my bit I'm

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.060 
downside is because with my bit I'm
going<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.950> put<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.870> then<00:04:24.870> grab<00:04:25.140> my<00:04:25.610> grill

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
going to put this on then grab my grill

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.400 
going to put this on then grab my grill
it<00:04:29.070> doesn't<00:04:29.640> fit<00:04:29.789> right<00:04:31.520> just<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.700> say<00:04:32.940> a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
it doesn't fit right just to say a

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.330 
it doesn't fit right just to say a
little<00:04:34.410> bit<00:04:35.190> too<00:04:36.000> big<00:04:36.560> but<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.590> want<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.220> get

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
little bit too big but I want it to get

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.380 
little bit too big but I want it to get
a<00:04:38.400> nice<00:04:38.610> tight<00:04:38.850> fit<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:40.380> I'm<00:04:40.470> going<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.890> is

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
a nice tight fit so I'm going to do is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.170 
a nice tight fit so I'm going to do is
glue<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.630> on<00:04:42.870> right<00:04:43.710> grab<00:04:44.700> my<00:04:44.820> glue<00:04:44.970> there

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
glue this on right grab my glue there

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.200 
glue this on right grab my glue there
glue<00:04:46.169> this<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.860> then<00:04:47.640> when<00:04:47.850> it's<00:04:47.970> dry<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
glue this on and then when it's dry and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.710 
glue this on and then when it's dry and
all<00:04:48.419> that<00:04:48.600> I'm<00:04:48.900> going<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.140> take<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:50.390> dremel<00:04:51.390> and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
all that I'm going to take a dremel and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
all that I'm going to take a dremel and
just<00:04:52.140> sand<00:04:52.680> down<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.070> edges<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.820> this<00:04:54.120> fits

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
just sand down the edges so this fits

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.360 
just sand down the edges so this fits
perfectly<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.340> doesn't<00:04:56.880> need<00:04:57.000> much

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
perfectly because it doesn't need much

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.830 
perfectly because it doesn't need much
that<00:04:58.940> they're<00:04:59.919> hard<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:00.980> do<00:05:01.040> with<00:05:01.160> one<00:05:01.190> hand

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
that they're hard to do with one hand

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.470 
that they're hard to do with one hand
anyways<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.930> can<00:05:03.050> see<00:05:03.199> how<00:05:03.380> it's<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:04.270> this<00:05:05.270> a

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
anyways you can see how it's just this a

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.360 
anyways you can see how it's just this a
doesn't<00:05:05.810> fit<00:05:05.990> type<00:05:06.230> thing<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:07.479> but<00:05:08.479> with<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
doesn't fit type thing so but with the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.700 
doesn't fit type thing so but with the
one<00:05:10.370> inch<00:05:10.580> our<00:05:11.150> half<00:05:11.690> inches<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.020> size<00:05:12.260> sorry

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
one inch our half inches in size sorry

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.420 
one inch our half inches in size sorry
a<00:05:12.740> half<00:05:13.400> inch<00:05:13.610> song<00:05:13.880> countersink<00:05:15.250> makes<00:05:16.250> it

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
a half inch song countersink makes it

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.439 
a half inch song countersink makes it
fit<00:05:16.669> like<00:05:17.440> it's<00:05:18.440> like<00:05:18.560> perfect

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
fit like it's like perfect

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.330 
fit like it's like perfect
so<00:05:20.560> anyways<00:05:21.560> I'm<00:05:21.770> going<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.010> go<00:05:22.100> ahead<00:05:22.160> and

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
so anyways I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.580 
so anyways I'm going to go ahead and
glue<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:23.710> stay<00:05:24.710> tuned<00:05:24.919> for<00:05:25.100> part<00:05:25.160> two

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
glue that and stay tuned for part two

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.390 
glue that and stay tuned for part two
where<00:05:27.590> I<00:05:27.949> will<00:05:28.190> be

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
where I will be

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.370 
where I will be
Farber<00:05:28.850> glassing<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.389> hopefully<00:05:29.930> installing

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
Farber glassing and hopefully installing

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.889 
Farber glassing and hopefully installing
and<00:05:30.500> test-fitting
