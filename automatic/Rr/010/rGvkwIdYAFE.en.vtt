00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.500 

it<00:01:39.880> pretty<00:01:40.360> fast<00:01:40.810> for<00:01:41.140> small<00:01:41.830> kids<00:01:42.100> like<00:01:42.510> my

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
it pretty fast for small kids like my

it's<00:01:48.850> longer<00:01:49.390> than<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.960> thought<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.670> see

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
it's longer than I thought as you see

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.390 
it's longer than I thought as you see
it's<00:01:52.660> kind<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.050> harder<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:54.040> I've<00:01:54.160> stripped

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
it's kind of harder and I've stripped

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's kind of harder and I've stripped
out<00:01:54.550> more<00:01:54.760> like<00:01:54.910> this<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.590> yeah<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.860> little

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
out more like this so yeah it's a little

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.140 
out more like this so yeah it's a little
harder<00:01:58.470> all<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:01.660> is<00:02:01.900> also<00:02:02.080> good<00:02:02.410> looking

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
harder all this is also good looking

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560 
harder all this is also good looking
color<00:02:04.150> is<00:02:04.330> another<00:02:04.630> gun<00:02:04.930> 15<00:02:05.650> case<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.570> you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
color is another gun 15 case so you

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.609 
color is another gun 15 case so you
never<00:02:07.660> know<00:02:07.930> when<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.170> might<00:02:08.290> need<00:02:08.350> another

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
never know when you might need another

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.500 
never know when you might need another
gun<00:02:08.980> it<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.430> your<00:02:09.580> not<00:02:09.760> a<00:02:09.790> bus<00:02:10.060> from<00:02:10.210> here

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
everything else is okay with the long

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.570 
everything else is okay with the long
shot<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.530> though<00:03:12.739> well<00:03:13.549> cut<00:03:13.790> out<00:03:13.970> for<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:17.019> okay

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580

now<00:03:19.580> for<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:20.019> long<00:03:21.019> straight<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:22.269> say<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
now for the long straight I say the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.830 
now for the long straight I say the
mantra<00:03:23.569> is<00:03:23.989> good<00:03:24.530> because<00:03:24.849> if<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:26.510> look<00:03:26.630> at<00:03:26.810> it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
mantra is good because if you look at it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.759 
mantra is good because if you look at it
it<00:03:27.830> comes<00:03:28.069> with<00:03:28.340> one<00:03:28.610> in<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:28.970> site<00:03:29.410> like<00:03:30.410> how

you one 12 and 13 now this only comes
with<00:05:35.690> one<00:05:36.050> magazine<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.860> know<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:37.970> sucks

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
with one magazine I know it sucks

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.120 
with one magazine I know it sucks
because<00:05:38.630> usually<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.500> blue<00:05:39.680> ones<00:05:39.830> come<00:05:40.010> with

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
because usually the blue ones come with

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.170 
because usually the blue ones come with
two<00:05:40.310> magazines<00:05:40.790> or<00:05:41.000> more<00:05:41.270> than<00:05:41.420> that<00:05:41.770> but<00:05:42.770> it's

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
two magazines or more than that but it's

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.110 
two magazines or more than that but it's
brandy<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:45.110> since<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:46.220> think<00:05:47.030> it's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
brandy so I since I think it's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.180 
brandy so I since I think it's
reasonable<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.600> have<00:05:47.840> one<00:05:48.020> magazine<00:05:48.230> else<00:05:48.890> see

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
reasonable to have one magazine else see

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.040 
reasonable to have one magazine else see
how<00:05:49.280> this<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.700> over<00:05:50.000> there<00:05:50.180> Oh<00:05:55.600> pops<00:05:56.600> one<00:05:56.900> as

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
how this is over there Oh pops one as

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.890 
how this is over there Oh pops one as
you<00:05:57.170> see<00:05:57.350> on<00:05:57.790> an<00:05:58.790> air

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
you see on an air

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:09.840 
you see on an air
Oh

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:16.870 

ok<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:13.180> see<00:06:14.180> this<00:06:14.900> is<00:06:15.110> better<00:06:15.320> because<00:06:15.880> instead

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
ok I see this is better because instead

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.240 
ok I see this is better because instead
of<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.120> long<00:06:17.330> shot<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:18.140> access<00:06:18.710> is<00:06:18.890> actually

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
of the long shot the access is actually

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.160 
of the long shot the access is actually
easier<00:06:19.670> when<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:19.940> unlock<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.570> you<00:06:21.020> can

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
easier when you unlock it you can

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.440 
easier when you unlock it you can
actually<00:06:21.290> get<00:06:21.530> to<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.770> faster<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.940> long<00:06:23.150> shot

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
actually get to it faster the long shot

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.310 
actually get to it faster the long shot
but<00:06:24.080> like<00:06:24.440> when<00:06:25.040> you<00:06:25.190> unload<00:06:25.730> it<00:06:25.910> run<00:06:26.900> away<00:06:27.020> for

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
but like when you unload it run away for

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.800 
but like when you unload it run away for
a<00:06:27.350> bit<00:06:27.470> till<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:28.040> access<00:06:28.670> falls<00:06:29.030> down<00:06:29.330> which<00:06:29.660> I

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
a bit till the access falls down which I

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.480
