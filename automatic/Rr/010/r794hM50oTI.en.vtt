00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
away see a little spot back here but

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.880 
away see a little spot back here but
it's<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:26.580> even<00:00:26.820> being<00:00:27.029> major<00:00:27.710> seats<00:00:28.710> are

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's not not even being major seats are

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
it's not not even being major seats are
actually<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.609> cleaner<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:31.170> were

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
actually much cleaner than they were

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.530 
actually much cleaner than they were
made<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> auction<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:36.210> said
