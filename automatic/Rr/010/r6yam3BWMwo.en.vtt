00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 to express the productive potential 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.660
 narrowly, it's not fair 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.129
 we compare absolutely the pines of animals raised 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.869
 not even servants 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.060
 disappointment 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.400
 or messi or nis 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.380
 although it is every step are completely different steps 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.919
 consequently the opportunity of these animals had involved 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.170
 and that the city muscle procapei noticed different 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.900
 the genetic variation breeding programs always working then 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.280
 with the unit called handling lot and always with the deviations 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.489
 the individual with a half-day relationship 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.890
 of the handling lot 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 this round formation 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.520
 genetic evaluations always comparing 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.600
 In a way 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 justice 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.810
 animals 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.050
 created in different production systems 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 the extreme can be a brachiaria 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.950
 and hulk and a post for example preparation with the runway of judgment but are two 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 quite extreme environments then one more time 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.070
 It is important to remember that managers are related to the management group and that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.310
 no matter how good it is with a management group 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.750
 he has a background 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.800
 and no matter how good he tries to get down then it's important we distribute 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.370
 of sports 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
 according 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.710
 and 8 8 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.390
 all presented is not to point to a reference of morphological type but 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.619
 to present a tool that can guide 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.340
 the size you are afraid of the backlands that you use where you will 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.419
 It's a tool with the picker I lead the kind of cattle he wants 

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:07.510
 create if the picker 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.450
 posted where he heard a higher biotype of the pib gets there using it 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.450
 Come on, he said it's a biotype. 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.610
 another hypothesis 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.020
 it arrives there using rpm now the tool is very important in 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.149
 sense to expand is to show and producers 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:33.499
 and by the genetic evaluation of this producer we know the consistency 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:39.749
 of the animal in transmitting precocity and muscularity 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:45.909
 which we can have a breeder and thank you very much of the type biotype 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.239
 lino in that he said in plc much of what he show 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.580
 but it can be a consequence 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.269
 of animal mating 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.529
 the early biot and is usually due to the fact that as a biotype it pleases but 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:06.699
 necessarily the production of this sector will be like it 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.209
 she should position one hour plus practice another hour more for each 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.979
 author over here 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:19.239
 giving no consistency to the delegate that he senator who was 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.789
 conducted 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.579
 what we are looking for 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.579
 using this tool is what we believe 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.169
 who get to bio types of individuals plus the lowest groin tributes 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.579
 more muscled animals 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.619
 which is more convenient for the producer 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.049
 that's what we're looking for 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.659
 Cain 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 km without forgetting fertility 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:47.999
 once again 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 performance in production 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.189
 and why it is important for us to use genetic evaluation 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.719
 What is it used for? 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.430
 because I and the producer it transmits more with less than a certain 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.900
 genetic variation of this characteristic 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.339
 individual 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.449
 based on the phenotype 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.799
 That's all we can finally dismiss. 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.779
 until we prove the quality we can lose quiet time money 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.280
 always using the probability of scalloping to decrease 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:34.089
 we can increase in pepper or through the internet by interval between generations 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:37.050
 the shot and animals marizete 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.860
 I did everything I could and had to generate 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.860
 o the financial implications 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.870
 for the moment key perception 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.490
 of breeding
