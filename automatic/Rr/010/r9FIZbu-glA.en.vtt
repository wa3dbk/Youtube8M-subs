we<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.719> distribution<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.899> after<00:00:36.899> many

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
we do more distribution of it after many

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
we do more distribution of it after many
trial<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> errors<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
trial and errors to try to get it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.020 
trial and errors to try to get it
exactly<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.829> scratch<00:00:41.129> recipe<00:00:41.640> which<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
exactly like the scratch recipe which it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000 
exactly like the scratch recipe which it
finally<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:42.540> gotten<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> way<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
finally has gotten to be that way and so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.690 
finally has gotten to be that way and so
with<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> volume<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.570> about<00:00:46.700> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
with the volume that we do about you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.439 
with the volume that we do about you
know<00:00:47.789> anywhere<00:00:48.090> from<00:00:49.160> 1200<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.360> 2,200<00:00:51.360> pounds

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
know anywhere from 1200 to 2,200 pounds

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.889 
know anywhere from 1200 to 2,200 pounds
of<00:00:51.690> dough<00:00:51.840> per<00:00:52.050> day<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> scratch

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
of dough per day you know the scratch

of dough per day you know the scratch
mixing<00:00:55.010> was<00:00:56.010> becoming<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:56.730> bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
mixing was becoming a little bit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.770 
mixing was becoming a little bit
inhibitive<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.840> us<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.260> far<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.590> timing<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
inhibitive to us as far as timing and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
inhibitive to us as far as timing and
consistency<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> mix<00:01:01.800> has<00:01:02.309> cut<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
consistency and so the mix has cut that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
consistency and so the mix has cut that
down<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> has<00:01:03.600> allowed<00:01:03.870> us<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.920> our

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
down and has allowed us to up our

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.880 
down and has allowed us to up our
production<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.119> our<00:01:06.860> ability<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.810> have

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
production and our ability to have

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.910 
production and our ability to have
product<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:10.979> our<00:01:11.460> customers<00:01:12.740> readily<00:01:13.740> as

product for our customers readily as

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.719 
product for our customers readily as
they<00:01:14.130> need<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.640> we've<00:01:15.330> grown<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
they need it as we've grown one of the

they need it as we've grown one of the
things<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.270> getting<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> way<00:01:19.820> was

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
things that was getting in the way was

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
things that was getting in the way was
mixing<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.360> scratch<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.530> know

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
mixing from scratch there was you know

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
mixing from scratch there was you know
tons<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.610> different<00:01:23.729> ingredients<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.479> we're

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
tons of different ingredients that we're

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200 
tons of different ingredients that we're
having<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> weigh<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.759> every

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
having to weigh out and you know every

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
having to weigh out and you know every
once<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.600> while<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> time<00:01:28.320> there

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
once in a while from time to time there

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.520 
once in a while from time to time there
would<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> mistake<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:30.000> made<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
would be a mistake that was made and you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
would be a mistake that was made and you
know<00:01:31.619> after<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.909> two<00:01:33.570> hours

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
know after you're you know two hours

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
know after you're you know two hours
into<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> dough<00:01:34.439> you've<00:01:35.070> realized<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
into the dough you've realized that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120 
into the dough you've realized that
there<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> mistake<00:01:36.270> made<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.799> far<00:01:38.040> as

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
there was a mistake made as far as

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
there was a mistake made as far as
measuring<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:38.820> something<00:01:39.119> else<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
measuring or something else and so we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
measuring or something else and so we
approached<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.829> foods<00:01:41.189> about<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
approached on foods about doing and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.160 
approached on foods about doing and
formulating<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> mix<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.600> an<00:01:45.720> exact

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
formulating a mix that would be an exact

everything<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.360> either<00:02:09.630> needed<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:10.320> have

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
everything so you either needed to have

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
everything so you either needed to have
people<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.070> were<00:02:11.220> highly<00:02:11.610> trained<00:02:12.030> or

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
people that were highly trained or

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.840 
people that were highly trained or
master<00:02:12.930> bakers<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:16.200> coupled<00:02:16.770> with

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
master bakers and that coupled with

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.040 
master bakers and that coupled with
people<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.000> needed<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.600> their<00:02:18.750> head<00:02:18.930> in

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
people that needed to have their head in

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.530 
people that needed to have their head in
the<00:02:19.170> game<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.560> far<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:19.860> timing<00:02:20.160> when<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.300> mix

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the game as far as timing when to mix

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.450 
the game as far as timing when to mix
and<00:02:21.870> how<00:02:22.440> long<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.070> take<00:02:23.310> them

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and how long it was going to take them

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.070 
and how long it was going to take them
to<00:02:23.520> mix<00:02:23.850> if<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.120> took<00:02:24.240> them<00:02:24.390> ten<00:02:24.630> minutes<00:02:24.960> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to mix if it took them ten minutes to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.350 
to mix if it took them ten minutes to
put<00:02:25.140> together<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.920> batch<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> dough<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:27.240> know

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
put together a batch of dough you know

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.690 
put together a batch of dough you know
you<00:02:27.630> would<00:02:27.780> almost<00:02:27.900> need<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.560> person<00:02:29.100> that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
you would almost need one person that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
you would almost need one person that
was<00:02:30.000> almost<00:02:30.330> delegated<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.500> mix<00:02:31.770> dough

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
was almost delegated to just mix dough

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.830 
was almost delegated to just mix dough
all<00:02:32.280> day<00:02:32.490> long<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.780> kind

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
all day long and so you know it's kind

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.690 
all day long and so you know it's kind
of<00:02:34.020> cut<00:02:34.140> down<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.440> labor<00:02:34.680> helped<00:02:35.580> with

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
of cut down on labor helped with

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.090 
of cut down on labor helped with
consistency<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:37.380> helped<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> production

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
consistency and helped in the production

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.010 
consistency and helped in the production
process<00:02:38.430> itself<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:41.330> we<00:02:42.330> kind<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.780> hit<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> wall

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
process itself it we kind of hit a wall

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
process itself it we kind of hit a wall
with<00:02:43.470> our<00:02:43.530> our<00:02:44.040> production<00:02:44.730> process<00:02:44.910> because

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
with our our production process because

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.750 
with our our production process because
we<00:02:47.040> were<00:02:47.160> only<00:02:47.280> able<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.850> move<00:02:47.970> customers<00:02:48.690> as

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
we were only able to move customers as

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.090 
we were only able to move customers as
if<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:50.940> had<00:02:51.150> say<00:02:51.420> one<00:02:51.750> register<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.860> know<00:02:52.950> we

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
if we had say one register you know we

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.740 
if we had say one register you know we
knew<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> had<00:02:53.430> enough<00:02:53.820> customers<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.570> have

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
knew we had enough customers to have

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.190 
knew we had enough customers to have
three<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> four<00:02:55.740> registers<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.780> there's<00:02:58.020> only

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
three to four registers but there's only

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710 
three to four registers but there's only
so<00:02:58.470> much<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.400> with<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> limited

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so much that you can do with a limited

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.990 
so much that you can do with a limited
production<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.470> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:02.010> only<00:03:02.160> mix<00:03:02.490> so

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
production so if you can only mix so

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.690 
production so if you can only mix so
many<00:03:03.150> batches<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> dope<00:03:03.840> per<00:03:04.140> hours<00:03:04.590> say<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.830 

you<00:03:08.700> know<00:03:08.790> there's<00:03:09.000> no<00:03:09.180> reason<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> put<00:03:09.750> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you know there's no reason to put in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.390 
you know there's no reason to put in
more<00:03:09.959> fryers<00:03:10.260> or<00:03:10.500> anything<00:03:10.800> else<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
more fryers or anything else like that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.690 
more fryers or anything else like that
so<00:03:11.610> now<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:13.100> formulated<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.370> mix

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
so now that we have formulated that mix

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
so now that we have formulated that mix
and<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.600> part<00:03:15.900> has<00:03:16.110> become

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and it that that part has become

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.250 
and it that that part has become
something<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.610> can<00:03:17.760> do<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.209> mirror<00:03:18.720> less

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
something that we can do in mirror less

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.240 
something that we can do in mirror less
than<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.560> minute<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.690> once<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.739> crank<00:03:23.070> out

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
than a minute so once you can crank out

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.660 
than a minute so once you can crank out
that<00:03:23.520> production<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.330> lot<00:03:24.360> better<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
that production a lot better then you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.220 
that production a lot better then you
can<00:03:26.850> add<00:03:27.060> more<00:03:27.270> registers<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.959> can<00:03:28.080> move

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
can add more registers you can move

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.830 
can add more registers you can move
people<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.769> lot<00:03:29.010> quicker<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.330> know<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.600> try

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
people a lot quicker and you know we try

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.990 
people a lot quicker and you know we try
to<00:03:30.900> average<00:03:31.230> about<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:32.070> know<00:03:32.190> 30<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.610> 45

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
to average about you know 30 to 45

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.910 
to average about you know 30 to 45
seconds<00:03:33.420> per<00:03:33.600> customer<00:03:34.940> allowing<00:03:35.940> for<00:03:36.920> you
