00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
interest into it and then I force myself

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
interest into it and then I force myself
to<00:01:14.250> play<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> achievement<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.450> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to play it for the achievement but this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.179 
to play it for the achievement but this
campaign<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.530> started<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.920> really

nice<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.150> pretty<00:01:18.840> fun<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.259> far<00:01:19.409> it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
nice and it's pretty fun so far it's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.990 
nice and it's pretty fun so far it's
more<00:01:19.770> interactive<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.729> its<00:01:20.880> really

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
more interactive and its really

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
more interactive and its really

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.509 
and they're really powerful and I look
picking<00:04:17.709> those<00:04:17.769> things<00:04:18.010> up<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.220> love<00:04:18.370> going

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.300 
picking those things up I love going
around<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:18.789> map<00:04:18.970> with<00:04:19.150> them<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:21.160> other

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
around the map with them and the other

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.560 
around the map with them and the other
thing<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.549> like<00:04:21.729> about<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.969> multi<00:04:22.240> player<00:04:22.390> that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
thing I like about the multi player that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.149 
thing I like about the multi player that
they<00:04:22.690> brought<00:04:22.900> back<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.349> um<00:04:23.590> they<00:04:23.950> didn't

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
they brought back is um they didn't

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.060 
they brought back is um they didn't
change<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.900> avi<00:04:25.900> air<00:04:26.080> stomp<00:04:26.440> into<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.770> perk

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
change the avi air stomp into a perk

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.600 
change the avi air stomp into a perk
like<00:04:27.219> I<00:04:27.310> thought

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
like I thought

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.490 
like I thought
might<00:04:27.849> have<00:04:28.150> they<00:04:28.539> kept<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.139> liking

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
might have they kept it and liking

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.200 
might have they kept it and liking
crisis<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.219> air<00:04:30.340> stomp<00:04:30.669> thing<00:04:30.789> was<00:04:30.909> a<00:04:30.939> perk

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
crisis to the air stomp thing was a perk

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.339 
crisis to the air stomp thing was a perk
which<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.539> where<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.840> jump<00:04:32.020> up<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.289> air

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
which is where you jump up in the air

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.020 
which is where you jump up in the air
and<00:04:32.469> go<00:04:32.800> down<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.009> slam<00:04:33.550> your<00:04:33.669> fist<00:04:33.879> on<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
and go down and slam your fist on the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.240 
and go down and slam your fist on the
ground<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.389> kill<00:04:34.509> people<00:04:34.629> and<00:04:35.039> that<00:04:36.039> that's

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
ground and kill people and that that's

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.159 
ground and kill people and that that's
still<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.699> game<00:04:37.000> mechanic<00:04:37.150> now<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:37.780> they<00:04:37.990> don't

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
still a game mechanic now so they don't

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.629 
still a game mechanic now so they don't
have<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.319> have<00:04:38.439> you<00:04:38.979> have<00:04:39.009> to<00:04:39.159> have<00:04:39.219> the<00:04:39.400> perk

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
have to have you have to have the perk

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.369 
have to have you have to have the perk
to<00:04:39.759> do<00:04:39.849> that<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.150> I'm<00:04:40.270> glad<00:04:40.449> they<00:04:40.689> they<00:04:41.020> kept

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.529 
to do that so I'm glad they they kept
that<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:42.069> the<00:04:42.370> game<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:42.909> other<00:04:43.240> thing<00:04:43.360> is
