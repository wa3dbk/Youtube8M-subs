00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.780
 Hi everyone, today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.020
 wash and tape that I bought in the leader 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.020
 a little while ago but good 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.550
 these are here they are all together as 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.370
 You see they come in packages and three in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.700
 three and well I will try to teach you 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.300
 one by one so you can see the ones 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.160
 I bought myself although from what I saw there was 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.950
 several more styles but when I got there 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 There were no other different colors 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.080
 here we have the prints in 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.990
 leopard and one of stripes here we have the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 of diamonds 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.509
 which are three different 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 in the package always comes in three 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.390
 different but there are in some packages 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.640
 that are repeated from other good packages 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 here come those of topitos there are three 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.850
 different and if you see in the package that you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 I'm going to teach now one of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 previous is repeated in this and we have 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 the one of the little birds also that tries 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.009
 look for scrap paper but with that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.320
 drawing because I loved it but nothing new 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.570
 way and that I just taught though 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.850
 I've already left it on the table 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.850
 Christmas this is more of flowers 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.440
 this is all black and white and the truth 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.510
 that looks pretty good because it seems 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.690
 as if they were tiptoe 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.610
 This is a variety of stripes and a little 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.650
 a childish one that after tractors and brings 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.590
 buses 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.250
 and it will be great for some craft 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.250
 back to school 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.420
 what I have here is the one 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.420
 stars 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.670
 this other one here is also varied and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.670
 it's so very sweet very for children 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 and look in the middle has letters 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.720
 here we have one so it has like 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.720
 several mixtures 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.940
 this one that also repeats a the one of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.450
 cage that came in another 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.450
 Y 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 good to see the next 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 this here is all about flowers and the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.550
 last one also has as if they were 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.350
 lyrics although it does not look very good because 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.790
 it reflects the cameras 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.439
 but good 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.750
 this happens not to have camera 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.750
 professionals this butterflies 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.450
 this one here are purple tones 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.340
 you can leave it like this and save like this 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 storing them although it occupies enough and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.130
 so what I have done is take a 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.690
 I have cut the cookie box apart 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.300
 small pieces and I made myself as a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.150
 kind of organizer had more washi 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.550
 tape so that almost filled a drawer 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.170
 in zero with that and well I will teach 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.660
 how they came sealed 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.660
 pretty good come on, it was difficult what 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.450
 that you lose you miss and good 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.500
 bring that I was already open some 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.500
 I had to cut them with scissors 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.640
 it comes pretty well stuck with a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.640
 security adhesive 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.989
 and the truth is that you can paste a lot 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.250
 of times that do not need to make us 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.780
 you need to get them out of there if not 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.300
 you want but I'm going to teach a little 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.890
 that comes in cardboards above when I 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.489
 I bought it you only see this part 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.160
 so 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.709
 now I'm going to now you're going to see that the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:13.870
 inner part actually comes quite 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.870
 little washi clip and too much cardboard 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.570
 look 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.240
 to see now how I teach it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.370
 Well first I will teach you 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680
 and the truth is that it is a small glass that 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.289
 pretty good that the texture is nice and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.219
 it's smooth it does not have 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.219
 our sting 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.470
 but looking at that is what I wanted to teach 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.170
 which has quite a bit however is 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.230
 a lot of cardboard and as from the part of 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.350
 above it is not seen then some 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.420
 maybe he did not think he could 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.800
 use in many jobs but it goes 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.080
 to be spent pretty fast 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.520
 and well I will try to go but that 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.520
 You can easily store again 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.070
 and now I'm going to show you some ornaments 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.760
 that I bought 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.160
 They are baby ornaments and there were several 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.870
 guys were loose and in shape 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.540
 of valance I bought them in the form of 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.490
 valance because the truth is that the 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.170
 I can not make them loose, and the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.100
 of valance if I can make them loose 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.010
 cutting one by one 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.400
 they came enough and good they are pacifiers 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.340
 bibs bears as you see are united ones 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.249
 to others I bought them in rosita 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.849
 and I bought them in blue 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.619
 and the same are bibs and pacifiers 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.420
 baby bottles I think some cart came 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.640
 of baby some foot 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.460
 and now I'm going to show you the seals that 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.740
 I also bought in the leader there were two 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.210
 types come in a plastic box 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.030
 The truth is that I left them because they 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.960
 they keep pretty well 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.340
 ink and they are from alphabets and phrases I 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.250
 although I have them stored in a box 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.820
 so I have also left them inside 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.820
 its plastic 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.509
 and these are the alphabet ones that although 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.879
 there are people who say that they have 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:15.169
 come out pretty bad to me the truth that 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:17.659
 I have done well they have 22 layers in the 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.169
 fa veto up and down and here is the one of 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.120
 the phrases 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.860
 I'm going to open it so you can see the sentences 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.719
 but while I open it I will say that the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.360
 alphabet there is one thing that I do not like and 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.790
 is that around the letter 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.860
 comes 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.720
 a circle that is a bit ugly if 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.660
 you want to put phrases the big ones because 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.540
 hidden too much and good these are the 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.370
 the phrases that brought the other's 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.720
 the seals and this is the ink that does not 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.289
 has opened with which I do not know if 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.169
 works well in one working 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.139
 but look here come the stamps and 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.749
 has enough phrases and the truth that 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.759
 for the price it was pretty good 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:57.800
 and it's economical and if you see where I 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.930
 I keep other wooden blocks because 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.080
 they are for the stamps that I make myself 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.280
 that I will teach you how you know and good 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.410
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.850
 my purchases do not hesitate to show me the 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.620
 you can give me like in the 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.789
