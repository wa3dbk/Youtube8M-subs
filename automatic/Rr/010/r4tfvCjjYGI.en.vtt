00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.699 
put together a pretty good team getting
Danny<00:02:59.560> Green<00:02:59.950> UD<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:01.360> we<00:03:01.840> lost<00:03:02.020> five<00:03:02.290> games<00:03:02.560> in

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.350 
Danny Green UD but we lost five games in
a<00:03:02.800> row<00:03:02.830> during<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.340> simulation<00:03:03.940> what's<00:03:04.120> going

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
a row during the simulation what's going

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.300 
a row during the simulation what's going
on<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:05.320> now<00:03:05.410> let's<00:03:05.590> continue<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
on but now let's continue in the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.699 
on but now let's continue in the
simulation<00:03:06.970> look<00:03:07.630> at<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.050> we're<00:03:08.410> winning

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
simulation look at this we're winning

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.640 
simulation look at this we're winning
games<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.310> want<00:03:09.520> five<00:03:09.820> games<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.600> row<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.620> i

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
games we want five games in a row so i

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.229 
games we want five games in a row so i
think<00:03:11.769> i<00:03:12.010> put<00:03:12.220> together<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.580> pretty<00:03:12.820> good<00:03:13.090> team

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
think i put together a pretty good team

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.940 
think i put together a pretty good team
and<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.570> we're<00:03:13.750> starting<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.170> win<00:03:14.320> game<00:03:14.560> so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and now we're starting to win game so

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.520 
and now we're starting to win game so
maybe<00:03:15.690> things<00:03:16.690> are<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.200> little<00:03:17.380> bit

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
maybe things are going a little bit
