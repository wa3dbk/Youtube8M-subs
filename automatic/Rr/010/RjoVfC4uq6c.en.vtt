foundation and I bought this when I was

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.060 
foundation and I bought this when I was
in<00:04:30.410> Paris<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:32.260> didn't<00:04:33.260> really<00:04:33.500> like<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.800> at

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
in Paris so I didn't really like it at

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.920 
in Paris so I didn't really like it at
that<00:04:34.310> time<00:04:34.729> because<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.180> felt<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.660> made<00:04:35.780> my

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
that time because I felt that it made my

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.650 
that time because I felt that it made my
facebook<00:04:36.410> very<00:04:36.710> very<00:04:37.100> flaky<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.450> guess

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
facebook very very flaky and I guess

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.050 
facebook very very flaky and I guess
that's<00:04:38.930> also<00:04:39.229> because<00:04:39.380> my<00:04:40.310> skin<00:04:40.610> over<00:04:40.910> there

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
that's also because my skin over there

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.379 
that's also because my skin over there
was<00:04:41.350> extremely<00:04:42.350> dry<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.979> was<00:04:43.160> still<00:04:43.550> adjusting
