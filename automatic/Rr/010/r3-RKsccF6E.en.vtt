realm<00:03:30.480> which<00:03:30.930> will<00:03:31.080> increase<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.470> damaged<00:03:31.830> by

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
realm which will increase is damaged by

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.670 
realm which will increase is damaged by
out<00:03:32.640> however<00:03:33.090> much<00:03:33.270> more<00:03:33.870> damage<00:03:34.200> you're

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
out however much more damage you're

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.990 
out however much more damage you're
doing<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.520> Shadow<00:03:35.670> Realm

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
doing in the Shadow Realm

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.150 
doing in the Shadow Realm
so<00:03:36.210> say<00:03:36.420> we're<00:03:36.600> doing<00:03:36.840> five<00:03:37.080> percent<00:03:38.040> more

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
so say we're doing five percent more

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
so say we're doing five percent more
damage<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.700> Shadow<00:03:38.910> Realm<00:03:39.000> we're<00:03:39.660> gonna

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
damage in the Shadow Realm we're gonna

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.430 
damage in the Shadow Realm we're gonna
be<00:03:40.050> taking<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:41.550> I'm<00:03:41.850> gonna<00:03:42.000> be<00:03:42.150> taking<00:03:42.510> five

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
be taking or I'm gonna be taking five

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.230 
be taking or I'm gonna be taking five
percent<00:03:43.740> more<00:03:43.920> damage<00:03:43.950> but<00:03:44.430> also<00:03:44.520> he'll<00:03:45.030> be

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
percent more damage but also he'll be

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.000 
percent more damage but also he'll be
taking<00:03:45.540> five<00:03:45.720> percent<00:03:45.990> more<00:03:46.050> damage<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.560> you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
taking five percent more damage so you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.350 
taking five percent more damage so you
can<00:03:47.250> kind<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.460> use<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.700> your<00:03:47.820> advantage<00:03:48.210> if

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
can kind of use it your advantage if

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.060 
can kind of use it your advantage if
you've<00:03:48.480> got<00:03:48.660> well<00:03:48.990> over<00:03:49.020> geared<00:03:49.440> tanks<00:03:49.920> I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
you've got well over geared tanks I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.380 
you've got well over geared tanks I
think<00:03:50.520> we<00:03:50.760> were<00:03:51.000> around<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:51.600> five<00:03:51.930> percent<00:03:53.390> I'm

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
think we were around on five percent I'm

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.050 
think we were around on five percent I'm
not<00:03:54.540> really<00:03:54.630> sure<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.080> how<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.830> scales<00:03:56.100> up<00:03:56.430> but

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
not really sure to how it scales up but

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.930 
not really sure to how it scales up but
it<00:03:57.390> basically<00:03:57.690> means<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.280> Helion<00:03:59.310> will<00:03:59.670> do

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
it basically means that Helion will do

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.850 
it basically means that Helion will do
between<00:04:00.720> 5%<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.800> 20%<00:04:02.070> damage<00:04:02.850> extra<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.710> if

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
between 5% and 20% damage extra and if

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.620 
between 5% and 20% damage extra and if
obviously<00:04:05.040> if<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.400> do<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:05.730> damage<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.360> this

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
obviously if we do more damage in this

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.270 
obviously if we do more damage in this
realm<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.140> shadow<00:04:07.320> realm<00:04:07.500> are<00:04:07.860> going<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.220> be

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
realm the shadow realm are going to be

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.920 
realm the shadow realm are going to be
having<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.640> harder<00:04:08.940> time<00:04:08.970> what<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> generally

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
having a harder time what I generally

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.930 
having a harder time what I generally
say<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.650> because<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> shadow<00:04:11.430> realm<00:04:11.640> is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
say is because the shadow realm is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.620 
say is because the shadow realm is
harder<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:13.110> found<00:04:13.410> you've<00:04:14.400> got<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.970> know<00:04:15.090> rate

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
harder we found you've got you know rate

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.830 
harder we found you've got you know rate
damage<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.410> because<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.210> crowd<00:04:18.570> as

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
damage and because of the this crowd as

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.020 
damage and because of the this crowd as
well<00:04:19.109> as<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.290> beam<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.950> take<00:04:20.489> into<00:04:20.640> economy<00:04:20.970> in

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
well as the beam to take into economy in

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.780 
well as the beam to take into economy in
doing<00:04:21.210> this<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.450> easy<00:04:21.710> I'm<00:04:22.710> relatively<00:04:23.460> sure

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
doing this is easy I'm relatively sure

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.370 
doing this is easy I'm relatively sure
healing<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.510> easy<00:04:24.840> or<00:04:25.290> easier

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
healing this is easy or easier

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.720 
healing this is easy or easier
than<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.010> Shadow<00:04:27.250> Realm<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.610> you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
than in the Shadow Realm so you

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.780 
than in the Shadow Realm so you
basically<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.090> want<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.270> send<00:04:29.100> more<00:04:30.100> DPS<00:04:30.550> or

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
basically you want to send more DPS or

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.430 
basically you want to send more DPS or
your<00:04:30.940> top<00:04:31.150> DPS<00:04:31.570> into<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.140> Shadow<00:04:32.350> Realm

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
your top DPS into the Shadow Realm

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440 
your top DPS into the Shadow Realm
because<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.520> mean<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.850> can<00:04:33.940> pretty<00:04:34.060> much<00:04:34.180> take

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
because I mean you can pretty much take

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.290 
because I mean you can pretty much take
it<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.990> physical<00:04:35.140> realm<00:04:35.880> what<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:36.910> will<00:04:37.090> say

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
it in the physical realm what I will say

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.870 
it in the physical realm what I will say
is<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.510> as<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.290> tank<00:04:38.980> it's<00:04:39.370> pretty<00:04:39.700> easy

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
is that as a tank it's pretty easy

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.120 
is that as a tank it's pretty easy
tactics<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:41.260> don't<00:04:41.500> really<00:04:41.590> have<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.830> run<00:04:41.980> out

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
tactics you don't really have to run out

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.040 
tactics you don't really have to run out
at<00:04:42.280> any<00:04:42.400> point<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.820> hardest<00:04:43.120> thing<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.420> kiting

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
at any point the hardest thing is kiting

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.370 
at any point the hardest thing is kiting
the<00:04:44.230> beam<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.480> Shadow<00:04:46.480> Realm<00:04:46.570> I'm<00:04:46.960> sorry<00:04:47.290> I

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
the beam in the Shadow Realm I'm sorry I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.660 
the beam in the Shadow Realm I'm sorry I
can't<00:04:47.560> really<00:04:47.650> give<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.830> any<00:04:47.950> footage<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.520> it

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
can't really give you any footage of it

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.390 
can't really give you any footage of it
but<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:50.380> basically<00:04:50.530> just<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.950> beam<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.190> goes

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
but it's basically just a beam that goes

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.640 
but it's basically just a beam that goes
from<00:04:51.730> Hell<00:04:51.970> Aeons<00:04:52.150> head<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.600> his<00:04:53.050> tail

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
from Hell Aeons head to his tail

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.270 
from Hell Aeons head to his tail
just<00:04:54.400> run<00:04:54.610> around<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:55.420> room<00:04:55.930> get<00:04:56.680> him<00:04:56.980> in<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
middle of the room just spin him round

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.410 
middle of the room just spin him round

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
relatively slowly because you obviously

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.000 
relatively slowly because you obviously
need<00:05:01.750> bear<00:05:01.960> in<00:05:02.230> mind<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.590> people<00:05:02.770> are
