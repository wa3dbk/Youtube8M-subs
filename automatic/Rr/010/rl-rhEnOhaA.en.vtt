all<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.960> stuff<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.379> pretty<00:00:55.619> normal

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
all that good stuff that's pretty normal

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
all that good stuff that's pretty normal
kind<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.220> stuff<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.580> practice<00:00:56.970> what<00:00:57.119> we<00:00:57.180> train

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
kind of stuff we practice what we train

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.079 
kind of stuff we practice what we train
I<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:58.049> the<00:00:58.110> dummy<00:00:58.350> might<00:00:58.500> outweigh<00:00:58.769> me

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
I think the dummy might outweigh me

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.250 
I think the dummy might outweigh me
pretty<00:01:00.089> interesting<00:01:00.600> seeing<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.900> towed<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pretty interesting seeing we towed it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.469 
pretty interesting seeing we towed it
across<00:01:01.470> tier<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.920> try<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.189> get<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:02.339> walls<00:01:03.210> fast

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
across tier I try to get over walls fast

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.969 
across tier I try to get over walls fast
as<00:01:03.600> possible<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.799> choice

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
as possible so you get the first choice

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
as possible so you get the first choice
of<00:01:05.159> weaponry<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.790> definitely<00:01:06.750> believe<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of weaponry I definitely believe that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.270 
of weaponry I definitely believe that
I'm<00:01:07.229> gonna<00:01:07.380> nail<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.189> no

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I'm gonna nail this a bit with no

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
I'm gonna nail this a bit with no
problem<00:01:08.700> let's<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:11.930> once<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.049> start

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

gets<00:02:00.190> over<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> wall<00:02:00.580> first<00:02:00.820> which<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.149> think<00:02:01.360> I

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
gets over the wall first which I think I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.840 
gets over the wall first which I think I
barely<00:02:01.810> beat<00:02:02.470> Josh<00:02:02.680> over<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.039> wall<00:02:03.190> but<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:03.700> had

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
barely beat Josh over the wall but I had

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.730 
barely beat Josh over the wall but I had
the<00:02:03.970> inside<00:02:04.270> line<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.259> started<00:02:05.619> with<00:02:05.710> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the inside line and so I started with a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.560 
the inside line and so I started with a
shotgun<00:02:06.039> which<00:02:06.369> it's<00:02:06.640> an<00:02:06.729> easier<00:02:07.060> going<00:02:07.360> to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
shotgun which it's an easier going to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.479 
shotgun which it's an easier going to
use<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.990> hit<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.770> problem<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:09.340> it's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
use to hit with the problem was it's

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.840 
use to hit with the problem was it's
much<00:02:09.670> slower<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.000> load<00:02:11.489> probably<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.550> hardest

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
much slower to load probably the hardest

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.520 
much slower to load probably the hardest
thing<00:02:12.880> about<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.390> shotgun<00:02:13.690> itself<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.350> just

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
thing about the shotgun itself is just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
thing about the shotgun itself is just
the<00:02:14.620> way<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.070> had<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> round<00:02:15.580> sort<00:02:16.360> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the way that they had to round sort of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.150 
the way that they had to round sort of
stacked<00:02:16.690> out<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:17.800> they<00:02:17.890> would<00:02:18.040> have

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
stacked out you know if they would have

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.860 
stacked out you know if they would have
been<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.370> ice<00:02:18.489> roads<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.000> 3<00:02:19.209> or<00:02:19.239> 4<00:02:19.390> would've

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
been in ice roads at 3 or 4 would've

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.060 
been in ice roads at 3 or 4 would've
been<00:02:19.959> easier<00:02:20.320> without<00:02:20.470> having<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> worry

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
been easier without having to worry

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.910 
been easier without having to worry
about<00:02:21.100> knocking<00:02:21.430> off<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.850> table<00:02:22.680> yeah<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
about knocking off the table yeah the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680 
about knocking off the table yeah the
shotgun<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.580> was<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> haven't<00:02:25.480> messed<00:02:25.570> with

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
shotgun it was one I haven't messed with

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.090 
shotgun it was one I haven't messed with
shotgun<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.260> while<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.709> haven't<00:02:26.950> messed

shotgun in a while and I haven't messed
shot<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.760> gun<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.209> thought<00:02:28.810> we'd<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:28.989> more

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
