 Nintendo 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.230
 putting with him one hundred percent already 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.700
 They are working hard for this 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.530
 game be the one that sells wii consoles or 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.950
 one of the sells consoles in which 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.230
 it has come out quite a lot to my mind it sells 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.430
 consoles like the smash bros mario kart 8 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.040
 this cell were going to be great games 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.950
 recently the wind waker came out and the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.330
 her team 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 is not ready yet and focus there 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.769
 concentrated one hundred percent in this 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.629
 new zelda has for the stirrup cell 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.150
 budget here I do not know what engine 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.000
 graph will have will be the current type and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.800

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.209
 hand everything you say that this 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.340
 new zelda will have more or less 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.390
 better graphics of course

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.930
 deaf jazz as the demographic that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.760
 they put us on this is the potential that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.239

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.959

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.519
