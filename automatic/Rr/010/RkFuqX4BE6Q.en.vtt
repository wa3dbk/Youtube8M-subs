00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
what's up guys it's Dave here a lot of

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.249 
what's up guys it's Dave here a lot of

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
people have been asking me about my

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.340 
people have been asking me about my
exhaust<00:00:04.740> what<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> have<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.270> how<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.170> can

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
exhaust what I have on it how they can

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.410 
exhaust what I have on it how they can
make<00:00:07.529> their<00:00:07.830> car<00:00:08.099> sound<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.880> first<00:00:09.210> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
make their car sound like it first you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.480 
make their car sound like it first you
got<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.010> 3800<00:00:11.010> engine<00:00:11.540> 38<00:00:12.830> 3.8<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
got to have a 3800 engine 38 3.8 and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.019 
got to have a 3800 engine 38 3.8 and
then<00:00:15.299> basically<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:17.100> got<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> replace<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
then basically you got to replace the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.840 
then basically you got to replace the
catalytic<00:00:18.720> converter<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.250> resonator

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
catalytic converter and the resonator

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.070 
catalytic converter and the resonator
with<00:00:21.180> high<00:00:21.390> flow<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.039> 3-inch<00:00:24.080> just

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
with high flow I use the 3-inch just

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.640 
with high flow I use the 3-inch just
because<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:27.150> highest<00:00:27.510> flow<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.380> cat

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
because the highest flow there's the cat

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.490 
because the highest flow there's the cat
I<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> guys<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
I don't know if you guys can see that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.350 
I don't know if you guys can see that
you<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> alright<00:00:32.700> okay

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you know you can see it alright okay

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.450 
you know you can see it alright okay
there's<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> cat

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
there's the cat

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.479 
there's the cat
there's<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> resonator<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.340> know

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
there's the resonator you you know

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
there's the resonator you you know
that's<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.390> keeps<00:00:39.840> everything<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> nice

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that's it keeps everything to a nice

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's it keeps everything to a nice
humble<00:00:42.059> drone<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.579> back

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
humble drone and then around the back

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.060 
humble drone and then around the back
here<00:00:46.070> yeah<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> Y<00:00:48.480> pipe<00:00:49.070> which

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
here yeah we go back to a Y pipe which

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.720 
here yeah we go back to a Y pipe which
is<00:00:50.100> custom<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> exhaust<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.010> shut

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is custom well from the exhaust but shut

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.479 
is custom well from the exhaust but shut
as<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.390> Y<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> comes<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
as your Y and then it comes back to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.430 
as your Y and then it comes back to
these<00:00:56.850> dual<00:00:57.120> flows<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.469> flowmaster<00:00:58.920> series

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
these dual flows the flowmaster series

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.720 
these dual flows the flowmaster series
6000<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.800> lying<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.250> stomach

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
6000 so I'm lying on my stomach

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.010 
6000 so I'm lying on my stomach
um<00:01:03.860> yeah<00:01:04.890> flowmaster<00:01:05.580> series<00:01:06.330> 60<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
um yeah flowmaster series 60 and then it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
um yeah flowmaster series 60 and then it
comes<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.799> nice<00:01:08.610> four<00:01:08.970> inch<00:01:09.090> pipe

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
comes back to these nice four inch pipe

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
comes back to these nice four inch pipe
s--<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.979> key<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.430> far<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.820> I'm

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
s-- now these are key as far as I'm

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.510 
s-- now these are key as far as I'm
concerned<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> nice<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
concerned with the nice you know the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
concerned with the nice you know the
nice<00:01:14.729> Rumble<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
nice Rumble they they really make it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.899 
nice Rumble they they really make it
sound<00:01:16.799> good

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
sound good

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.990 
sound good
and<00:01:19.180> if<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.750> do<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.140> you'll<00:01:20.680> sound<00:01:21.130> just<00:01:21.700> as

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
and if you do that you'll sound just as

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.630 
and if you do that you'll sound just as
good<00:01:22.479> as<00:01:22.659> this<00:01:22.899> I've<00:01:23.560> seen<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.950> lot<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.189> videos

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
good as this I've seen a lot of videos

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.520 
good as this I've seen a lot of videos
about<00:01:24.869> Magnaflow<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.020> I'm<00:01:26.110> probably<00:01:26.320> going

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
about Magnaflow and I'm probably going

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.639 
about Magnaflow and I'm probably going
to<00:01:26.649> start<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.950> big<00:01:27.100> flaming<00:01:27.460> thing<00:01:27.820> here<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:28.329> I

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
to start a big flaming thing here but I

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.870 
to start a big flaming thing here but I
prefer<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.799> flowmasters<00:01:30.520> over<00:01:30.759> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
prefer the flowmasters over the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.700 
prefer the flowmasters over the
Magnaflow<00:01:31.420> they<00:01:31.570> just<00:01:31.720> have<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> beefier<00:01:32.350> sound

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
Magnaflow they just have a beefier sound

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.169 
Magnaflow they just have a beefier sound
to<00:01:32.890> them<00:01:33.539> more<00:01:34.539> more<00:01:35.320> muscle<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.179> that's

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
to them more more muscle and that's

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.880 
to them more more muscle and that's
that's<00:01:37.479> what<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.720> was<00:01:37.929> after<00:01:38.079> with<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.679> wish

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
that's what I was after with this I wish

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.590 
that's what I was after with this I wish
it<00:01:39.039> was<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.189> little<00:01:39.520> louder<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.090> higher

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
it was a little louder in the higher

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.700 
it was a little louder in the higher
rpms<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:44.020> got<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.409> get

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
rpms but you know you got what you get

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.029 
rpms but you know you got what you get
we<00:01:44.829> get<00:01:45.069> sometimes<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.590> yeah<00:01:47.590> I'm<00:01:47.740> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> do

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
a little startup video of it hopefully

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.899 
a little startup video of it hopefully
it's<00:01:50.259> not<00:01:50.409> too<00:01:50.470> windy<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:51.099> then<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.369> little<00:01:51.580> rev
