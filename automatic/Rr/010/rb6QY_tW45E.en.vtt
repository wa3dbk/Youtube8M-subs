00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.320
 seen 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.599
 subjects well of this and he immediately of 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.579
 minecraft I could with then on who in this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 new video and like telethon from the title 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:23.099
 today we are here to start a map 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 survival that did my writing on 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.630
 his name is vaffa gamer you can find it too 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 here then so what the rules of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.990
 that sky block because we are not gods 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.870
 nos to blogs are floating islands 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 in the void and we slowly become more so 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.309
 where episode I must succeed in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.449
 reach all of them map by vaffa 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.339
 gamer welcome this and one back 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.870
 with the objectives and the rules are the 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.699
 text files along with the map 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
 if in fact now if you remember me maybe you 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.149
 I put the goals here maybe I do 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.039
 really a list all here in a row 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 so you see them they are still hi a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.090
 all the objectives of this map for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 the note including the definitively 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 then she immediately started here before 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.070
 what we talk about this bed I think 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.109
 can you take me take it for that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 it can also serve then we go down 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 anyway gavoi immediately comb through here 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.390
 under mine I like it if precisely for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.460
 serve you like it seems also due 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.039
 bring a new series after quite a while 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 of time that no new series comes out a 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.179
 so I would say to clean this whole island 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.160
 so you can think about our bed 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.470
 quietly so I would say to put it 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.569
 type here perfect now we also collect 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 these sugar canes could 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.979
 very well serve later for some 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.729
 for some farm that we will have to create 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.050
 gender 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.000
 so I would say to break down immediately 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.860
 this tree and hoping that we bump into it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.250
 of the saplings so we can 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.410
 replant the headlights and other trees then 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 we take all our wood 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.009
 possible however moments we are in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.470
 build of 9 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.170
 bild enough laundry snow you like you 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.479
 the gui or the pilot bar car 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 really microscopic the little hearts are 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.759
 really microscopic is a bug a little 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.729
 so I like it then then 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.739
 we are the usual perfect wood 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.679
 we catch a cache in the wall 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:08.470
 we appreciate near the bed as always 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.330
 first of all a nice pick 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.400
 better so much the other tools don't 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.910
 there is a so I would say we can 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.410
 digging right i think probable perfect 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.780
 however if then it will be a series that 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.030
 will last enough at least I hope 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 shit no boy we can't do it 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 nothing going anyway a bit 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.860
 strange why we should go out go in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.990
 that island 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.640
 I don't know how to command us 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.890
 I think we will use wood because 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 the covered kind straight we cannot 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.190
 do because precisely the lava is all 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.660
 on the other hand, however, you will know one 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.090
 map created as I said written by me 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.510
 so if there is any bug I will have to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.910
 to report to the creator precisely the innkeeper 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.650
 he is the only one you feel I am 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.320
 that remains something and robbie to pull 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.360
 however now cook some perfect iron 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.450
 of her to take it pro after having cash 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.520
 stone pickaxe improves without falling 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.000
 maybe we are the pick 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.350
 next or that in stone 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.570
 perfect we have already made a leap of 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.640
 immense quality ok but we can 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.320
 collect our beautiful iron 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 we will also be careful not to be careful 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.150
 fall because if you split like here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.040
 here we are already in the perfect void to do 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.380
 The trolley then know with these three 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.019
 pieces we found of iron 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.810
 I think and that you will have to castrate the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.000
 ax ax of iron at least I think then if 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.980
 it is not so or shit raga which of the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 all half destroyed anyway I would say 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.420
 to scrutinize these in detail 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.280
 boat maybe there is some surprise in 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.350
 I don't know what it will show you 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.880
 very careful not to fall when or how 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.470
 in older versions of minecraft that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.540
 if it falls you will not miss anything but but 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.840
 you really lose everything so therefore you must 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.190
 the furnace is perfect 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.410
 we admit close to being forced 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.950
 see start to cook ours 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.150
 but beautiful iron after having collected 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.570
 sapling which later will have taken another 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.670
 tree 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.140
 we have the perfect counted sapling 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.900
 we will plant soon after 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.549
 so now I would say to put some 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.380
 wood 18 of a super power this one 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.110
 anyway boy in the comments always 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.700
 write me if you like this new one 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.170
 beginning of the series however the other series 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.180
 therefore they will always continue there 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.549
 worry that they will still go ahead 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.360
 there will be some alternative i 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.610
 video of the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.470
 when main is a bit divided between the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.790
 sky block so don't worry about that 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.400
 every evening that there are and such 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.680
 will remain active perfect we can already 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.330
 immediately make us our pick in 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 iron then if maybe we already have 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.420
 completed some goal was not 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.460
 they are a list here at hand 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.630
 so I wouldn't know just then 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.430
 one thing that made me and those 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.680
 I didn't play in the shield archives 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 never collected so now we're playing 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.880
 in wings then in the todi profile will be 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.830
 or so there is another sapling 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.830
 perfect we keep it aside maybe there 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.740
 it will serve in the future here and there is true 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.590
 was completely cut down paraga 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.910
 I think the island is complete 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.910
 because I don't think it's there anymore 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.220
 nothing else in the hope now I have to go out 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.500
 to store lots of blocks per 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.180
 going out to go to the others because if 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.550
 no we get stuck here 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.120
 below the devastated island 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.830
 completely so we have to stay 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.230
 very careful when we go there 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.880
 I would also say to close the hole or rather not 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.650
 only open that I already had a few blocks 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.780
 so let's not risk the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.340
 first episode had come to an end 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.690
 and possible money for the evening we will go into 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.880
 I think one of these islands is me 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.680
 should go to the animal one 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.690
 in the end because of the ether not yet 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.370
 we are ready so road or tableware 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.080
 this beginning b series liked it 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.760
 so you left so many square 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.680
 there was also a comment and where he says that 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.419
 what do you think of this new series e 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.419
 nothing we would want a next ios
