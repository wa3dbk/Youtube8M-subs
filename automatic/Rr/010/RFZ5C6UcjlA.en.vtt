00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello when cementing to subscribers 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.629
 I was very happy and you will see right away 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.730
 Immediately why am I in such an interesting way 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.049
 I have by no means changed my profession 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 and so on I'm today and would really 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.570
 come true so one of the sword let's say 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 just a couple of hours and it was not there 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 forget me thank god enough 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 periodicity will be a concert finally 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 Agatha Christie to be honest very very 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.260
 I would like to see them long ago 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.019
 today finally my wish will come true 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.620
 that's why the timber is a little bit of a hand 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.820
 role on gothic as it were so 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.770
 let's say and I will quickly tell you about 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 that we are not made up, she painted me on 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 really very very much because 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.489
 that when I make such complex images 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.559
 usually determine gamma and pull out all 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 absolute money and point a finger already 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.149
 where will these all kinds of things look 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 I just adore when many, many there and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 things are mixed were still all in sequins 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 there in a row on top of general and that today 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.379

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 braids the code is Adel, he is such enough 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 iridescent 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.229
 bream the nails of the rule of law cut off and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 on top of it this iridescent 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.290
 there is this i talked so i just 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.990
 knurled matte finish 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.580
 which rimmel comes from my lipstick 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.689
 today I have it still did not show it 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.490
 of course 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.040
 the decoy of of course matte ruler is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.630
 in fact , not very few reviews 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.329
 principle, if without smokey on the eyes 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 enough is possible in principle for each 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.689

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 Sydney, if I'm not mistaken, she was called 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.060
 Yes, garbage is called that there to be 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.370
 all sorts of handbags are drawn and so on 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
 stunning absolutely she is so evening 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 a little bit besides the tone of color 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.970
 Champagne absolutely I look gentle 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.100
 and about very strongly and well shaded 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.900
 good thing for the evening just go on 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.639
 blush here on apples and on top mom 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.960
 wore cinderella which is practically 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.389
 shimmer which practically does not give 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.580
 no color because me and so 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.190
 harmony on the cheekbones and so flame attraction 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.350
 muscles and here it somehow had to 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.169
 a little bit literally just barely 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.400
 highlight the apples I've highlighted it 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.470
 and then from of course meteorites without 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.360
 meteorites nowhere of course 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.240
 evening without which I am also nowhere 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.430
 the dragons in the balls are absolutely amazing 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.740
 They fit absolutely under any makeup 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.660
 under light on dark in any scale 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.139
 Is this really adore 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.539
 rested straight even though 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.220
 everything else is quite complicated but skin 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.220
 by itself looks great 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.440
 think somehow differently and in front of 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.080
 I have everything in my eyes convulsively 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.490
 it’s generally difficult to spray and I’m on top 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.630
 today I used it again 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.180
 that in blood I will continue it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.920
 test but still then for there not 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.870
 kills at not really good many 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.000
 tomorrow I still thought that he was not mine 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.460
 some kind of plastic blur with me 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.550
 today smooth and a and i its just plain 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.230

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.000
 on top I went through cinderella with these 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.730
 elements of the shadow have not yet used 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.130

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.470
 delighted and so I already adore and this one 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.300
 very interesting pigment I didn’t even what 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.560

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.660

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.050
 so he seems in the bank here 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.360
 ink black actually i 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.950
 even the apple store took only because 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.840
 that max only because sinderella 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.820
 there was one left as it was said and 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.410
 Someone wanted to take this. I think I'll try. 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.360
 once such a case in general in general 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.310
 in the summer, how can I try black black 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.900
 pigment on his eyes he really 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.510
 completely black so about 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.000
 what is this lipstick color goes such 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.250
 eggplant and a lot of chimera 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.370
 such a golden and eggplant new very 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.560
 beautifully amazing looks expensive and 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.900
 this part is all 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.090

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.580
 well killed this one and you go there 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.740

 sparkling not shining not sparkles on 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.780
 car straight good sparkling sparkles 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.940
 what smokey without a good pencil is 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.800
 my favorite estee lauder which 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.420
 unlikely when you changed i have like 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.310
 would and click there black pencil is wrong 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.960

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.910
 On exit right such a specific Smokey I 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.080

 also eat and shade which is the limit to 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.770
 This spring has been like that

 they are nobody just a million sparkles on 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.800
 in fact, just the boundaries of them are very 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.560
 good at shading colors in them altogether 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.870
 virtually no brand new 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.120
 looks very, very so immediately 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.610
