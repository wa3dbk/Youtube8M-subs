00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220 
start to play some notes we will let the
thumb<00:02:11.670> drop<00:02:12.090> off<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.569> keyboard<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
thumb drop off the keyboard but the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
thumb drop off the keyboard but the
thumb<00:02:13.470> should<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.800> over<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.550> keyboard<00:02:14.760> at<00:02:15.060> all

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
thumb should be over the keyboard at all

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.940 
thumb should be over the keyboard at all
times<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.780> thumb<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.200> indeed<00:02:16.530> part<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
times the thumb is indeed part of the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
times the thumb is indeed part of the
hand<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:20.430> shouldn't<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.940> isolated<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
hand it shouldn't be isolated from the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.479 
hand it shouldn't be isolated from the
other<00:02:21.930> fingers<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.800> off<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.790> keyboard<00:02:25.489> now

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
other fingers and off the keyboard now

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.190 
other fingers and off the keyboard now
make<00:02:26.640> sure<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:27.030> overextend<00:02:27.420> your

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
make sure you don't overextend your

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.460 
make sure you don't overextend your
finger<00:02:28.590> joints<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.819> position<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.720> not<00:02:31.110> good

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
finger joints this position is not good

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.170 
finger joints this position is not good
so<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:33.660> need<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.230> rounded<00:02:34.950> fingers<00:02:35.489> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
so you need to have rounded fingers to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.509 
so you need to have rounded fingers to
get<00:02:36.269> an<00:02:36.390> idea<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.989> put<00:02:37.769> your<00:02:37.920> wrists

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
get an idea of this put your wrists

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.860 
get an idea of this put your wrists
together<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.090> imagine<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
together and imagine that you have a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.699 
together and imagine that you have a
crystal<00:02:40.380> ball<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.800> your<00:02:40.980> hands<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> make<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
crystal ball in your hands so make a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.530 
crystal ball in your hands so make a
sphere<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.489> your<00:02:44.640> hands<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.150> course<00:02:45.360> this

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
sphere with your hands of course this

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
sphere with your hands of course this
this<00:02:45.600> doesn't<00:02:46.170> work<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:47.040> yes<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.790> is

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this doesn't work but here yes this is

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.449 
this doesn't work but here yes this is
perfect<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.170> gives<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.680> an<00:02:49.920> awareness

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
perfect and this gives you an awareness

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.100 
perfect and this gives you an awareness
of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.819> rounded<00:02:51.239> finger<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.690> need<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
of the rounded finger that you need to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.860 
of the rounded finger that you need to
control<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> sound
