bobbin we will run this string through

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.670 
bobbin we will run this string through
here<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> side<00:01:23.780> over<00:01:24.140> here<00:01:24.259> inside

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
here and on the side over here inside

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.020 
here and on the side over here inside
this<00:01:24.860> gear<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:25.520> going<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> twist<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.439> back

and down so in just freewill I'm gonna
slide<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.130> bobbin<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.450> got<00:01:38.600> a

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
slide the bobbin on and it's got a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.380 
slide the bobbin on and it's got a
little<00:01:39.039> hole<00:01:40.039> in<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> back<00:01:40.579> side<00:01:40.609> that<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.119> pin

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
little hole in the back side that a pin

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.810 
little hole in the back side that a pin
is<00:01:41.509> going<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.719> slide<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.409> snaps<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:43.070> I'm

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
is going to slide in it snaps in I'm

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.179 
is going to slide in it snaps in I'm
going<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.060> push<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.390> down<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:45.469> engages<00:01:45.859> this

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
going to push it down that engages this

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.230 
going to push it down that engages this
rubber<00:01:46.460> wheel<00:01:46.789> to<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.570> job<00:01:47.899> mechanism<00:01:48.640> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.669 

then<00:01:53.240> we'll<00:01:53.390> take<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.020> string<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:56.530> put<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
then we'll take the string and put the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.050 
then we'll take the string and put the
string<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.009> that<00:01:58.250> little<00:01:58.520> slot<00:01:58.850> right<00:01:59.090> there

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
string in that little slot right there

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
string in that little slot right there
and<00:02:02.060> then<00:02:02.240> we'll<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.600> start<00:02:02.689> winding

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 

check<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.009> bit<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.819> ice<00:02:11.879> trim

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
check out a little bit on it ice trim

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.710 
check out a little bit on it ice trim
that<00:02:12.720> off<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:14.239> what's<00:02:15.239> cool<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:18.180> got<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.390> cam

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that off and what's cool it's got a cam

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.770 
that off and what's cool it's got a cam
down<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:20.430> allows<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.000> mechanism<00:02:21.660> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
down here that allows this mechanism to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.750 
down here that allows this mechanism to
go<00:02:21.930> back<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> forth<00:02:22.769> back<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.129> forth<00:02:23.519> like<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
go back and forth back and forth like a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.350 
go back and forth back and forth like a
windshield<00:02:24.090> wiper<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.040> as<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.280> fills<00:02:26.549> up<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
windshield wiper and as it fills up that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.309 
windshield wiper and as it fills up that
string<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.739> bit<00:02:28.950> higher<00:02:30.319> and

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
string will get a little bit higher and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:42.100 
string will get a little bit higher and
when<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.560> pops<00:02:31.799> off<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.599> bobbin<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.690> full

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.600 

that's<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.349> we're<00:02:44.190> done

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that's it we're done

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.630 
that's it we're done
cool<00:02:45.269> all<00:02:45.450> right<00:02:47.599> catch<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.870> hook<00:02:49.640> go
