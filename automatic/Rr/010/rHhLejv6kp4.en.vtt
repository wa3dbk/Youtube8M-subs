you can pick low quality but a we're
getting<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.369> from<00:01:08.580> perhaps

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
getting as you can see from perhaps

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
getting as you can see from perhaps
running<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> upper<00:01:09.540> left<00:01:09.750> corner<00:01:09.900> we're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
running the upper left corner we're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
running the upper left corner we're
getting<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.470> 39<00:01:11.040> hips<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> really

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
getting like 39 hips which is really

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.640 
getting like 39 hips which is really
very<00:01:12.330> impressive<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.049> integrated<00:01:13.500> graphics

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very impressive for integrated graphics

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
very impressive for integrated graphics
so<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> definitely<00:01:14.490> improvement<00:01:15.060> from

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
so this is definitely improvement from

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
so this is definitely improvement from

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.390 

my<00:04:11.050> third<00:04:11.290> tip<00:04:11.319> smells<00:04:11.800> interesting<00:04:11.980> how<00:04:12.340> the

my third tip smells interesting how the
red<00:04:12.670> over<00:04:12.940> life<00:04:13.120> or<00:04:13.269> when<00:04:13.390> you've<00:04:13.510> been

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
red over life or when you've been

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.630 
red over life or when you've been
wounded<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.709> slows<00:04:15.010> down<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.310> game<00:04:15.340> by

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
wounded really slows down the game by

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:30.690 
wounded really slows down the game by
about<00:04:15.879> four<00:04:16.269> frames<00:04:16.600> it's<00:04:16.840> uh

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.119 

you

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.469 

now<00:04:36.129> we're<00:04:36.339> going<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.610> play<00:04:36.789> call<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.300> duty

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
now we're going to play call of duty

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.200 
now we're going to play call of duty
modern<00:04:37.929> warfare<00:04:38.169> 3<00:04:38.589> another<00:04:39.159> very<00:04:39.490> recent<00:04:40.059> and

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
demanding game and we when we let it do

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.839 
demanding game and we when we let it do
its<00:04:44.080> own<00:04:44.229> settings<00:04:44.740> at<00:04:44.889> first<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.550> they<00:04:45.789> were

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
its own settings at first and they were

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.499 
its own settings at first and they were
a<00:04:46.389> little<00:04:46.779> bit<00:04:47.069> too<00:04:48.069> aggressive<00:04:48.189> actually<00:04:48.969> we

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
a little bit too aggressive actually we

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.019 
a little bit too aggressive actually we
kept<00:04:49.779> it<00:04:49.929> at<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.259> native<00:04:50.559> resolution<00:04:50.969> 1366<00:04:51.969> by

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
kept it at the native resolution 1366 by

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.929 
kept it at the native resolution 1366 by
768<00:04:52.479> but<00:04:53.020> we<00:04:53.110> had<00:04:53.259> to<00:04:53.409> turn<00:04:53.649> off<00:04:53.939> anti-aliasing

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
768 but we had to turn off anti-aliasing

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.350 
768 but we had to turn off anti-aliasing
we<00:04:55.509> had<00:04:55.749> had<00:04:56.259> anti-aliasing<00:04:57.099> at<00:04:57.279> 2x<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:57.999> we<00:04:58.179> got

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
we had had anti-aliasing at 2x so we got

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.809 
we had had anti-aliasing at 2x so we got
about<00:04:58.629> 17<00:04:59.379> fifths<00:04:59.770> which<00:04:59.949> is<00:05:00.129> just<00:05:00.459> really<00:05:00.669> not

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
about 17 fifths which is just really not

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.279 
about 17 fifths which is just really not
very<00:05:01.029> playable<00:05:01.240> in<00:05:01.479> this<00:05:01.629> kind<00:05:01.869> of<00:05:01.959> game<00:05:02.139> and

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
very playable in this kind of game and

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.949 
very playable in this kind of game and
we<00:05:02.889> sent<00:05:03.129> image<00:05:03.429> quality<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:04.149> normal<00:05:04.629> it<00:05:04.749> had

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:04.959 
we sent image quality to normal it had

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.019 
we sent image quality to normal it had
been<00:05:05.169> set<00:05:05.469> to<00:05:05.679> high<00:05:05.860> now<00:05:06.219> there's<00:05:06.399> actually<00:05:06.520> an

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
been set to high now there's actually an

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.059 
been set to high now there's actually an
even<00:05:07.180> higher<00:05:07.449> setting<00:05:07.930> than<00:05:08.080> high<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.529> couple

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
even higher setting than high a couple

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.129 
even higher setting than high a couple
of<00:05:09.159> various<00:05:09.459> settings<00:05:09.759> there<00:05:09.879> but<00:05:09.999> those<00:05:10.990> are

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
of various settings there but those are

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.689 
of various settings there but those are
the<00:05:11.199> only<00:05:11.439> changes<00:05:11.889> that<00:05:12.069> we<00:05:12.159> made<00:05:12.339> the<00:05:12.520> game

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
the only changes that we made the game

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.129 
the only changes that we made the game
still<00:05:12.969> looks<00:05:13.240> great<00:05:13.509> and<00:05:13.659> you'll<00:05:13.749> see<00:05:13.899> that<00:05:14.020> we
