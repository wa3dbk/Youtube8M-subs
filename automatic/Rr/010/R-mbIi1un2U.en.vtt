record<00:02:53.560> again<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.099> think<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.180> last

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
record again I think that's not last

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.030 
record again I think that's not last
season<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.870> know<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.139> season<00:02:56.440> before<00:02:56.709> he

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
season but you know the season before he

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.259 
season but you know the season before he
was<00:02:57.159> actually<00:02:57.370> injured<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:57.940> quite<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> long

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
was actually injured for quite a long

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.960 
was actually injured for quite a long
time<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.230> saw<00:02:59.620> mitten<00:03:00.010> City<00:03:00.519> missed<00:03:00.819> him

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
time so I saw mitten City missed him

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.429 
time so I saw mitten City missed him
quite<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> lot<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.750> course<00:03:01.959> they<00:03:02.139> won<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
quite a lot but of course they won the

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.009 
quite a lot but of course they won the
package<00:03:03.220> Premier<00:03:03.519> League<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:03.730> Aguero<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.900> was

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
package Premier League and Aguero it was

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.110 
package Premier League and Aguero it was
obviously<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.470> huge<00:03:05.889> help<00:03:06.189> to<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.549> but<00:03:06.879> and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
obviously a huge help to that but and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.449 
obviously a huge help to that but and
I'll<00:03:07.569> only<00:03:07.989> play<00:03:08.290> 26<00:03:08.590> games<00:03:08.829> you<00:03:09.129> know<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> think

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
I'll only play 26 games you know I think

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.009 
I'll only play 26 games you know I think
last<00:03:09.760> season<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.299> know<00:03:10.389> when<00:03:10.659> he<00:03:10.720> wasn't

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
last season you know when he wasn't

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.780 
last season you know when he wasn't
injured<00:03:11.109> he<00:03:11.319> played<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.590> 40<00:03:12.069> plus<00:03:12.280> games<00:03:12.459> so

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
injured he played like 40 plus games so

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.940 
injured he played like 40 plus games so
obviously<00:03:13.420> still<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.989> think<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.590> was<00:03:14.680> injured

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
obviously still I think it was injured

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.199 
obviously still I think it was injured
at<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.220> start<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.549> season<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.060> little

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
at the start of the season for a little

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.210 
at the start of the season for a little
bit<00:03:16.359> but<00:03:16.629> then<00:03:16.780> obviously<00:03:16.930> came<00:03:17.290> back<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.739> you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
bit but then obviously came back and you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.650 
bit but then obviously came back and you
know<00:03:18.430> cottage<00:03:18.879> position<00:03:19.239> back<00:03:19.419> immediately

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
know cottage position back immediately

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.050 
know cottage position back immediately
but<00:03:20.109> I'm<00:03:20.230> gonna<00:03:20.859> give<00:03:21.069> them<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.250> atra<00:03:21.730> because

to think this card is pretty overrated

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.059 
to think this card is pretty overrated
because<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.480> have<00:03:40.599> gone<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.989> lot<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.440> changes<00:03:41.919> but

because I have gone a lot of changes but
I<00:03:42.370> do<00:03:42.489> i<00:03:42.790> do<00:03:42.909> believe<00:03:43.150> he<00:03:44.019> deserves<00:03:44.169> it<00:03:44.560> you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
I do i do believe he deserves it you

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.199 
I do i do believe he deserves it you
know<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:44.889> that<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> great<00:03:45.400> season<00:03:45.669> from

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
know is that a great season from

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.250 
know is that a great season from
actually<00:03:46.569> night<00:03:46.720> other<00:03:46.989> than<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.229> know

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
actually night other than you know

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.069 
actually night other than you know
finishing<00:03:47.650> 675<00:03:48.639> obviously<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.720> not<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.900> good

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
finishing 675 obviously it's not a good

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.659 
finishing 675 obviously it's not a good
team<00:03:50.440> performance<00:03:50.919> but<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.129> think<00:03:51.370> he<00:03:51.459> played

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
team performance but I think he played

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.610 
team performance but I think he played
well<00:03:51.849> as<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> player<00:03:52.449> and<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.379> for<00:03:53.530> his

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
well as a player and you know for his

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.680 
well as a player and you know for his
first<00:03:53.829> year<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.489> first<00:03:54.819> starring<00:03:55.060> 11<00:03:55.540> I

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
first year in this first starring 11 I

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.759 
first year in this first starring 11 I
know<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.959> think<00:03:56.260> he's<00:03:56.379> played<00:03:56.590> absolutely

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
know I think he's played absolutely

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.460 
know I think he's played absolutely
incredibly<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.609> my<00:03:57.729> opinion<00:03:58.030> 16<00:03:58.930> games<00:03:59.169> for

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
incredibly in my opinion 16 games for

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.229 
incredibly in my opinion 16 games for
golfers<00:04:00.129> this<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.459> obviously<00:04:00.609> not<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.030> best

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
golfers this is obviously not the best

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.939

star<00:04:42.100> skimmers<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.610> basically<00:04:43.060> pretty

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
star skimmers is basically pretty

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.450 
star skimmers is basically pretty
obvious<00:04:43.930> because<00:04:44.410> he's<00:04:44.680> always<00:04:44.980> doing<00:04:45.190> step

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
obvious because he's always doing step

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.070 
obvious because he's always doing step
overs<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.090> stuff<00:04:46.330> trying<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.690> beat<00:04:46.810> his<00:04:46.930> man

and<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:48.130> think<00:04:48.370> that's<00:04:48.550> what<00:04:48.760> warrants<00:04:49.120> his

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
and I think that's what warrants his

and I think that's what warrants his
four<00:04:49.510> starts<00:04:49.630> goodness<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.350> finally<00:04:51.100> guess

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
four starts goodness and finally guess

for the final player of this episode now
I<00:04:55.780> do<00:04:56.080> actually<00:04:56.290> think<00:04:56.680> he<00:04:56.740> deserves<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.220> lot<00:04:57.370> of

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
I do actually think he deserves a lot of

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.830 
I do actually think he deserves a lot of
upgrades<00:04:57.640> because<00:04:58.210> he<00:04:58.330> has<00:04:58.420> had<00:04:58.600> an<00:04:58.720> awesome

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
upgrades because he has had an awesome

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.780 
upgrades because he has had an awesome
season<00:04:59.140> for<00:04:59.410> Southampton<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.070> currently

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
season for Southampton and currently

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.280 
season for Southampton and currently
been<00:05:00.970> playing<00:05:01.240> for<00:05:01.420> England<00:05:01.780> obviously<00:05:02.140> not

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
been playing for England obviously not

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.780 
been playing for England obviously not
doing<00:05:02.320> too<00:05:02.710> well<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.040> world<00:05:03.190> cup<00:05:03.370> as<00:05:03.610> we

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
doing too well in the world cup as we

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.700 
doing too well in the world cup as we
were<00:05:03.850> already<00:05:03.970> out<00:05:04.120> but<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.720> think<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.440> know<00:05:05.530> he

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
were already out but I think you know he

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.770 
were already out but I think you know he
showed<00:05:05.920> a<00:05:05.950> bright<00:05:06.310> spark<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.090> know<00:05:07.210> what

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
showed a bright spark of you know what

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.720 
showed a bright spark of you know what
he<00:05:07.900> could<00:05:08.080> do<00:05:08.230> for<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.470> future<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.550> think

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
he could do for the future and I think

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.580 
he could do for the future and I think
he's<00:05:09.850> only<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.060> why<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.720> think<00:05:10.840> he's<00:05:11.080> like<00:05:11.230> 26

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
he's only a why I think he's like 26

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.930 
he's only a why I think he's like 26

there's<00:05:23.950> a<00:05:24.010> pretty<00:05:24.610> decent<00:05:25.240> record<00:05:25.360> for<00:05:26.050> its

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
there's a pretty decent record for its

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.980 
there's a pretty decent record for its
first<00:05:26.410> year<00:05:26.680> in<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:26.920> BPL<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:28.510> think<00:05:28.840> I

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
first year in the BPL and but I think I

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.600 
first year in the BPL and but I think I
