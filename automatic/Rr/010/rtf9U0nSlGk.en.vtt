00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 if we can do it again 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 then we know that 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.489
 that between 1 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.189
 It is important as you want 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.019
 for that we have to use the term 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.019
 A dad 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 mechanical properties 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.160
 So until the example of water a farce 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 Bottrop 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.890
 is the liquid 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.140
 Physicist Gregersen stood 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 even substance h2o 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 a molecule of 2 hydrogen 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 we all know that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.940
 not only 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.820
 Christina Applegate 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.280
 but continue 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 Goals 0 degrees Celsius 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.280
 Graf needed gaseous state 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.720
 we also have 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.300
 how can you help them? 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 in different 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 through different properties 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.190
 Johannesburg 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 in my system 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.330
 that is historical 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 she added the food she wanted 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 I do not yet betray that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.660
 with no substance 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 in liquid form 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.429
 but it can also be quite that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.090
 I have that, for example 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.630
 Glass of mineral water 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.529
 there is more resistance for them 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.949
 Fixed percent 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 and gaseous come 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.649
 Hann MÃ¼nden 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.409
 the whole 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.169
 finally today 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.169
 Glass bubbles 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.659
 this promise of her 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.839
 Zeger second 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:41.499
 and with that is
