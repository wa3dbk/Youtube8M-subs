00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 Hey-this time you are an acoustic guitar beginner, have you ever bought a guitar this time and no one has bought it yet 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.270
 It might not be possible, but I will buy from now and tune first 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.740
 Tuning Oh 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:47.410
 But not to challenge for the first time Hey song to door 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.860
 Well I would like to try how to choose a song that beginners do not fall for the first time 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 I will 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.790
 First of all 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.050
 The code is easy and good I say f 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.950
 Oh dear 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 There is also that but it is to choose a simple code 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.850
 To Yes 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.909
 Easy to sing 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.409
 Yes, it is this important 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.409
 It is when choosing a difficult song from the beginning 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:22.490
 Nde that one song is to be called would give up before it can not be easily 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.179
 At first, it is easy to choose a simple song that is not easy to sing and you can not demand much singing ability . 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 First of all it is important to complete one station 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:35.799
 about it 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 In delivery 3 ー ー 2 ー It is easy The song is easy and the last is short 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.020
 It is a thing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:49.450
 First of all , it's a fictional one that can be a single station because it can be a little short 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 To Kyokusakura to introduce to you this time by say you definitely want to have 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.790
 I think I want to do it 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.659
 Hey ! 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:03.359
 It's a song that challenged everyone with a guitar, though 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.350
 There is a song that clears the 3 surprisingly it is a song that does not contain f a lot of easy year short songs 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:10.810
 There is 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.530
 The other important thing is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 Tai' was that ready-to-use stand in role 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.900

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.769

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.740
 Three things 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.290
 However 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.280
 Useless 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 Not a one song to dark to not be certain

 If you do that, you will get a pretty good impression 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.470
 For example, your child 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.250
 Aunt child or father and mother
