00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
just close it back down so you can see

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.750 
just close it back down so you can see
it<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.819> adds<00:02:13.000> great<00:02:13.299> action<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.840> it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it it adds great action on it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.820 
it it adds great action on it
I'm<00:02:15.760> still<00:02:16.510> getting<00:02:16.629> new<00:02:16.989> at<00:02:17.200> opening<00:02:17.650> knives

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
I'm still getting new at opening knives

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.670 
I'm still getting new at opening knives
as<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.129> can<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:18.489> but<00:02:18.940> very<00:02:19.569> firm<00:02:20.110> blocks<00:02:20.500> in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
as you can see but very firm blocks in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.920 
as you can see but very firm blocks in
the<00:02:20.769> place<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:22.409> quick<00:02:24.209> also<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.360> cuts<00:02:25.599> down<00:02:25.750> on

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the place and quick also it cuts down on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.780 
the place and quick also it cuts down on
the<00:02:26.080> weight<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.220> notice<00:02:27.430> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the weight if you can notice that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.210 
the weight if you can notice that
there's<00:02:27.940> really<00:02:28.090> nothing<00:02:28.480> shiny<00:02:29.220> protruding

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
there's really nothing shiny protruding

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.610 
there's really nothing shiny protruding
from<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.459> inside<00:02:30.879> there's<00:02:31.450> no<00:02:31.720> inner<00:02:32.049> linings

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
from the inside there's no inner linings

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.039 
from the inside there's no inner linings
to<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.299> definitely<00:02:34.480> cuts<00:02:34.810> down<00:02:34.989> the

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
to it so it definitely cuts down the

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.990 
to it so it definitely cuts down the
weight<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:36.629> then<00:02:37.629> as<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.959> can<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.970> where<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
weight and then as you can see where I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.880 
weight and then as you can see where I
kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.480> shake<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.870> knife<00:02:41.049> it's<00:02:41.379> locked<00:02:41.650> in

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
kind of shake the knife it's locked in

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.350 
kind of shake the knife it's locked in
the<00:02:41.980> place<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.519> has<00:02:42.730> no<00:02:43.420> movement<00:02:45.360> keeping

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the place so it has no movement keeping

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.259 
the place so it has no movement keeping
the<00:02:46.450> blade<00:02:46.829> nice<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.190> flush<00:02:48.430> between<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
the blade nice and flush between the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.750 
the blade nice and flush between the
handle<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.680> you're<00:02:50.829> not<00:02:50.859> losing<00:02:51.099> edge

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.780
