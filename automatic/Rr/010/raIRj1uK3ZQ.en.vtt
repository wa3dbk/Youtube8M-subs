Noah's heat and vibration coating so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.470 
Noah's heat and vibration coating so
let's<00:02:05.140> get<00:02:05.260> started

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480

or<00:02:16.819> six<00:02:16.940> feet<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> comfortable<00:02:17.750> level<00:02:17.900> we're

gonna mask off the the brake and the
suspension<00:02:22.519> system<00:02:22.849> right<00:02:23.180> now<00:02:23.360> also<00:02:23.780> I'm

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
suspension system right now also I'm

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.199 
suspension system right now also I'm
going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.290> spray<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.769> self<00:02:25.340> etching<00:02:25.459> primer<00:02:25.879> in

going to spray a self etching primer in
there<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.900> help<00:02:27.019> give<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.530> spectrum

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
there to help give the spectrum

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.229 
there to help give the spectrum
something<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.340> grab<00:02:28.489> onto<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.910> don't<00:02:29.060> need<00:02:29.209> a

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
something to grab onto you don't need a

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.660 
something to grab onto you don't need a
primer<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.349> just<00:02:30.530> very<00:02:30.709> helpful<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
primer it is just very helpful but the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.009 
primer it is just very helpful but the
reason<00:02:31.910> we're<00:02:32.030> doing<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.330> wheel<00:02:32.480> wells<00:02:32.720> is

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
reason we're doing the wheel wells is

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.979 
reason we're doing the wheel wells is
because<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.400> tires<00:02:34.849> are<00:02:35.120> spinning<00:02:35.360> they

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
because as the tires are spinning they

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.780 
because as the tires are spinning they
send<00:02:36.260> vibrations<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.069> first<00:02:37.280> place<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.519> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
send vibrations the first place that the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.089 
send vibrations the first place that the
vibrations<00:02:38.360> hit<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.530> wheel<00:02:39.709> wells<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
vibrations hit is the wheel wells the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.100 
vibrations hit is the wheel wells the
next<00:02:40.310> place<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.879> quarter<00:02:41.120> panels<00:02:41.480> then<00:02:41.989> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
next place is the quarter panels then it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.570 
next place is the quarter panels then it
travels<00:02:42.470> down<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.650> length<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.190> vehicle

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
travels down the length of the vehicle

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.339 
travels down the length of the vehicle

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
that accurate because the the wheels are

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.500

vehicle the wheels are not in line with

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
the floor so doing the floor it's

the floor so doing the floor it's
important<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.069> it's<00:03:01.190> kind<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.459> secondary

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
important but it's kind of a secondary

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.420 
important but it's kind of a secondary
concern<00:03:02.329> only<00:03:03.140> after<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> wheel<00:03:04.130> wells<00:03:04.340> and

concern only after the wheel wells and
the<00:03:04.549> quarter<00:03:04.790> panels<00:03:05.090> are<00:03:05.150> treated<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.480> that's

the quarter panels are treated so that's
