there<00:02:29.330> they're<00:02:29.600> obviously<00:02:29.720> pretty<00:02:30.110> secure

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
there they're obviously pretty secure

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
thick gauge steel as you can see it's

steel and you know I don't know if you
can<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:47.019> might<00:02:48.019> be<00:02:48.140> difficult<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.620> see

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
can really see might be difficult to see

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.650 
can really see might be difficult to see
that<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.250> thickness<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.239> getting<00:02:50.480> some

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
that the thickness and getting some

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.680 
that the thickness and getting some
better<00:02:50.840> light<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.340> pretty<00:02:55.519> much

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
better light you can you can pretty much

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.080 
better light you can you can pretty much
see<00:02:56.690> how<00:02:56.840> thick<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> metal<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:58.430> feels<00:02:58.970> like

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
see how thick the metal is it feels like

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.199 
see how thick the metal is it feels like
a<00:02:59.150> good<00:02:59.269> heavy-duty<00:02:59.600> piece<00:03:00.549> again<00:03:01.549> three-inch

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
a good heavy-duty piece again three-inch

a good heavy-duty piece again three-inch
three<00:03:02.660> inches<00:03:02.840> thick<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.170> will<00:03:03.230> provide<00:03:03.470> an

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
three inches thick it will provide an

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.830 
three inches thick it will provide an
inch<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> half<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.130> left<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.540> overall

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
inch and a half the left so overall

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.190 
inch and a half the left so overall
we're<00:03:06.500> gonna<00:03:06.680> have<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:06.860> two<00:03:07.100> inch<00:03:07.959> front<00:03:08.959> lift

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
we're gonna have a two inch front lift

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920 
we're gonna have a two inch front lift
and<00:03:09.650> inch<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.340> half<00:03:10.400> lift<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:10.910> rear<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and inch and a half lift in the rear and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.199 
and inch and a half lift in the rear and
that<00:03:12.620> should<00:03:12.799> provide<00:03:13.040> us<00:03:13.190> with<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.370> nice<00:03:13.610> level

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
that should provide us with a nice level
