00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
dispersed over the nail and I didn't

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.410 
dispersed over the nail and I didn't
feel<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.950> needed<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.370> second<00:02:16.760> layer<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.240> is

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
feel like I needed a second layer it is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.170 
feel like I needed a second layer it is
important<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.100> know<00:02:19.220> don't<00:02:19.550> have<00:02:19.700> to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
important that I you know don't have to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.680 
important that I you know don't have to
go<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> sparkle<00:02:21.350> coat<00:02:21.560> twice<00:02:22.010> because

go in with a sparkle coat twice because

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.290 
go in with a sparkle coat twice because
firstly<00:02:23.690> Sparkle<00:02:24.650> nail<00:02:24.830> polish<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.550> pain<00:02:26.000> in

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
the behind to have taken off or

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.460 
the behind to have taken off or
basically<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.090> take<00:02:29.270> off<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.630> acetone<00:02:30.170> I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
basically to take off with acetone I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.290 
basically to take off with acetone I
just<00:02:30.650> hate<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:30.980> when<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.459> particles<00:02:31.940> don't

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
just hate it when the particles don't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.540 
just hate it when the particles don't
evenly<00:02:33.050> dispersed<00:02:33.530> over<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.980> nails<00:02:34.220> like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
evenly dispersed over the nails like

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.699 
evenly dispersed over the nails like
when<00:02:34.730> there's<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.970> cluster<00:02:35.390> down<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
when there's a cluster down here and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.060 
when there's a cluster down here and
then<00:02:36.890> everywhere<00:02:37.580> else<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.060> really

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
then everywhere else it's like really

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.490 
then everywhere else it's like really
kind<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.430> clear<00:02:40.970> polish<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.810> don't<00:02:42.260> like

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
kind of just clear polish I don't like

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.860 
kind of just clear polish I don't like
having<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.459> dabbing<00:02:44.180> technique<00:02:44.660> with

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870

sparkle<00:02:45.290> nail<00:02:45.440> polishes<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.490> just<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
sparkle nail polishes this is just a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.500 
sparkle nail polishes this is just a
clear<00:02:47.780> base<00:02:48.190> purple<00:02:49.190> sparkle<00:02:49.820> nail<00:02:50.060> polish

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
and then smaller circular particles

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.870 
and then smaller circular particles
within<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.410> exact<00:02:57.860> same<00:02:58.040> color<00:02:58.250> basically

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
within the exact same color basically

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.300 
within the exact same color basically
now<00:02:59.270> there's<00:02:59.480> just<00:02:59.570> one<00:02:59.840> setback<00:03:00.739> with<00:03:01.190> these

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
now there's just one setback with these

nail polishes and I have to put in a
setback<00:03:03.620> because<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.730> give<00:03:04.850> it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
setback because I I have to give it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.479 
setback because I I have to give it
constructive<00:03:05.570> criticism<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.320> don't<00:03:06.800> know<00:03:07.160> what

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
constructive criticism I don't know what

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.170 
constructive criticism I don't know what
it<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.670> about<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.900> stem<00:03:09.380> or<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.519> cap<00:03:10.820> or

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it is about the stem or like the cap or

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.690 
it is about the stem or like the cap or
the<00:03:11.269> packaging<00:03:11.840> but<00:03:12.470> even<00:03:12.920> after<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.340> would

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
the packaging but even after I would

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.320 
the packaging but even after I would
wipe<00:03:13.940> off<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.450> nail<00:03:14.630> polish<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.970> lot<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.120> color

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
wipe off the nail polish a lot of color

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.920 
wipe off the nail polish a lot of color
would<00:03:17.690> drip<00:03:18.110> down<00:03:18.739> from<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.459> stem<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
would drip down from the stem of the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.890 
would drip down from the stem of the
nail<00:03:21.680> polish<00:03:22.040> applicator<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.540> was<00:03:23.720> one

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
nail polish applicator and that was one

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.080 
nail polish applicator and that was one
thing<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.140> kind<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.739> annoyed<00:03:25.489> me<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:25.910> I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
thing that kind of annoyed me because I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.240 
thing that kind of annoyed me because I
had<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.540> be<00:03:26.630> careful<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.200> not<00:03:27.350> over<00:03:27.860> apply<00:03:28.190> too

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
had to be careful to not over apply too

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.570 
had to be careful to not over apply too
much<00:03:28.640> nail<00:03:29.180> polish<00:03:29.660> onto<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.739> nail<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.160> it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
much nail polish onto the nail and it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.580 
much nail polish onto the nail and it
actually<00:03:31.790> varies<00:03:32.450> from<00:03:32.660> shade<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.350> shade<00:03:33.560> I

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
actually varies from shade to shade I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.590 
actually varies from shade to shade I
don't<00:03:33.950> know<00:03:34.040> if<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.549> because<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
don't know if it's because of the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.820 
don't know if it's because of the
liquidity<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.890> formula<00:03:37.580> or<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
liquidity of the formula or the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.850 
liquidity of the formula or the
packaging<00:03:40.430> I'm<00:03:40.760> not<00:03:41.030> exactly<00:03:41.360> sure<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.440> is

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
packaging I'm not exactly sure but it is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.729 
packaging I'm not exactly sure but it is
still<00:03:43.190> worth<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.940> because<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:45.200> formula<00:03:45.709> is

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
still worth it because the formula is

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.509 
still worth it because the formula is
great<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:47.510> nail<00:03:47.780> polish<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.650> actually

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
great and the nail polish it is actually

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.630 
great and the nail polish it is actually
very<00:03:49.700> very<00:03:50.420> good<00:03:50.630> I'm<00:03:50.900> impressed<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.250> hope

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
very very good I'm impressed so I hope

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.070 
very very good I'm impressed so I hope
