what it is I i really don't know I would
hope<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.100> at<00:01:45.579> one<00:01:45.759> point<00:01:45.790> in<00:01:46.119> his<00:01:46.149> career<00:01:46.360> he

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
hope that at one point in his career he

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.910 
hope that at one point in his career he
gets<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.899> under<00:01:47.170> wraps<00:01:47.320> because<00:01:47.649> I<00:01:47.860> think

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
gets that under wraps because I think

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.459

I<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:48.050> think<00:02:48.110> another<00:02:48.610> technically<00:02:49.610> sound

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
I don't think another technically sound

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.400 
I don't think another technically sound
defensively<00:02:51.470> responsible<00:02:52.280> fighter<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
defensively responsible fighter and and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.740 
defensively responsible fighter and and
and<00:02:54.950> Coco<00:02:55.370> Coco<00:02:55.970> throws<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.360> good<00:02:56.540> fight<00:02:56.720> I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
and Coco Coco throws a good fight I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990 
and Coco Coco throws a good fight I
think<00:02:57.020> he<00:02:57.110> does<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.370> good<00:02:58.700> amount<00:02:58.880> of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
think he does have a good amount of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.970 
think he does have a good amount of
defense<00:02:59.420> i<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.720> he<00:02:59.870> is<00:02:59.900> fast<00:03:00.260> i<00:03:00.530> think<00:03:00.860> i

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
defense i think he is fast i think i

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.550 
defense i think he is fast i think i
think<00:03:01.040> he<00:03:01.220> does<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.550> power<00:03:01.790> but<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:03.050> mean

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
think he does have power but I mean

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.470 
think he does have power but I mean
ultimately<00:03:03.830> if<00:03:04.460> that's<00:03:04.640> not<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.880> case<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.090> mean

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
ultimately if that's not the case I mean

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.510 
ultimately if that's not the case I mean
you<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.350> give<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.590> kinetic<00:03:06.950> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
you have to give it to kinetic this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.010 
you have to give it to kinetic this
point<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:07.970> gonna<00:03:08.060> be<00:03:08.210> used<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.540> hopefully

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
point it's gonna be used and hopefully

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.020 
point it's gonna be used and hopefully
doesn't<00:03:09.170> fade<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.770> usually<00:03:09.860> does<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
doesn't fade like it usually does but it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.900 
doesn't fade like it usually does but it
might<00:03:11.150> not<00:03:11.180> even<00:03:11.300> get<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.660> far<00:03:12.250> thank<00:03:13.250> you
