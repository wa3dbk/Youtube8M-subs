off<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.379> shelf<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
off the shelf and you think about it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.630 
off the shelf and you think about it
they<00:00:46.770> did<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.600> without<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:49.260> huge<00:00:50.010> exclusive

they did it without a huge exclusive
line<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
line up so what do you think is going to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
line up so what do you think is going to
happen<00:00:52.590> those<00:00:52.920> numbers<00:00:53.309> whenever<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.879> do

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
happen those numbers whenever they do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
start pumping out the exclusives like

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
start pumping out the exclusives like
you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> they're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you know that they're going to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
you know that they're going to
eventually<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.969> did<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> also

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
eventually do and then they did it also

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.830 
eventually do and then they did it also
without<00:01:01.590> having<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> lower<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> price<00:01:02.840> so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
without having to lower the price so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
without having to lower the price so
