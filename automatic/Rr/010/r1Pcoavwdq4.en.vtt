particular<00:02:13.300> watercraft<00:02:13.990> now<00:02:14.770> what<00:02:15.010> makes<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
particular watercraft now what makes it

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.260 
particular watercraft now what makes it
work<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.390> are<00:02:16.570> two<00:02:16.810> rare<00:02:17.260> earth<00:02:17.470> magnets

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
work is there are two rare earth magnets

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.420 
work is there are two rare earth magnets
one<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> inside<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.200> hole<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.770> one<00:02:21.310> on

one on the inside of the hole and one on
the<00:02:21.550> outside<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.270> hole<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:24.190> take<00:02:24.550> them

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the outside of the hole and to take them

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.180 
the outside of the hole and to take them
apart<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.530> let's<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> way<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.950> has<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
apart just let's see the way this has a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.310 
apart just let's see the way this has a
little<00:02:27.430> groove<00:02:27.700> here<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.510> twist<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.080> because

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
little groove here you twist it because

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.650 
little groove here you twist it because
they're<00:02:29.470> real<00:02:29.680> strong<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.330> place

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
they're real strong and then you place

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.920 
they're real strong and then you place
this<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.470> outside<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.280> craft<00:02:33.550> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
this on the outside of your craft and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.740 
this on the outside of your craft and
