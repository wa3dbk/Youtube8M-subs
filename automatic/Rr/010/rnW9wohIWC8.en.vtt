00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.399 
playing personally recommend playing
much<00:01:43.329> higher<00:01:43.539> than<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.719> but<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.020> do<00:01:44.170> have<00:01:44.380> a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
much higher than that but you do have a

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.810 
much higher than that but you do have a
really<00:01:44.619> high<00:01:44.710> precision<00:01:45.130> sensor<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:45.700> can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
really high precision sensor that can

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.950 
really high precision sensor that can
handle<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.450> if<00:01:46.509> you're<00:01:46.630> someone<00:01:46.810> who

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
handle this so if you're someone who

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.440 
handle this so if you're someone who
needs<00:01:47.170> extreme<00:01:47.619> precision<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.939> also<00:01:49.090> wants

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
needs extreme precision but also wants

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.899 
needs extreme precision but also wants
to<00:01:49.479> go<00:01:49.689> crazy<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.679> DPI<00:01:51.100> slash<00:01:51.429> CPI<00:01:51.789> you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
to go crazy with the DPI slash CPI you

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.730 
to go crazy with the DPI slash CPI you
could<00:01:52.179> do<00:01:52.359> that<00:01:52.509> with<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:52.840> mouse<00:01:53.049> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
could do that with this mouse the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.679 
could do that with this mouse the

this video is not gonna get into the
software<00:02:26.030> we're<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.750> talk<00:02:26.840> about<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
software we're gonna talk about the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.750 
software we're gonna talk about the
mouse<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.950> let's<00:02:28.100> take<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> tour<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
mouse now let's take a tour of all the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
mouse now let's take a tour of all the
different<00:02:29.090> buttons<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.510> mouse<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:30.650> have

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
different buttons on the mouse we have

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.390 
different buttons on the mouse we have
two<00:02:31.340> thumb<00:02:31.880> buttons<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:33.590> both<00:02:33.860> sides<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.370> I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
two thumb buttons on on both sides so I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
two thumb buttons on on both sides so I
guess<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.730> your<00:02:34.850> right<00:02:35.000> hand<00:02:35.210> you're<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.720> know

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
guess if your right hand you're you know

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.940 
guess if your right hand you're you know
you<00:02:35.870> have<00:02:35.990> two<00:02:36.140> thumb<00:02:36.380> buttons<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.800> right

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you have two thumb buttons on the right

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.710 
you have two thumb buttons on the right
side<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.430> left<00:02:38.030> hand<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.390> two<00:02:38.510> thumb

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
side and left hand you have two thumb

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.790 
side and left hand you have two thumb
buttons<00:02:38.990> on<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> other<00:02:39.440> side<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.770> can

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
buttons on the other side you can

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.530 
buttons on the other side you can
disable<00:02:40.160> these<00:02:40.400> buttons<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.450> know

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
disable these buttons you can you know

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.930 
disable these buttons you can you know
program<00:02:41.840> macros<00:02:42.230> using<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.100> software<00:02:43.520> but

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
program macros using the software but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.460 
program macros using the software but
you<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.570> use<00:02:44.660> all<00:02:44.810> four<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.080> them<00:02:45.260> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
you know you can use all four of them so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.230 
you know you can use all four of them so
on<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> other<00:02:46.070> side<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.520> can<00:02:46.640> use<00:02:46.850> your

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
on the other side here we can use your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.430 
on the other side here we can use your
ring<00:02:47.390> finger<00:02:47.420> your<00:02:47.900> pinky<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.230> hit<00:02:48.350> those

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
buttons on top of the mouse of course

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.340 
buttons on top of the mouse of course
you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.480> left<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:50.900> click<00:02:51.110> and

then behind that we have two additional
buttons<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.340> program<00:02:58.670> those<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.150> by

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
buttons you can program those but by

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.390 
buttons you can program those but by
default<00:02:59.570> that'll<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.560> know<00:03:00.650> adjust<00:03:00.890> your<00:03:01.070> dpi

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
default that'll you know adjust your dpi

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.340

doesn't get any flatter than just
aluminum<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:42.860> will<00:03:43.040> work<00:03:43.190> with<00:03:43.340> LED<00:03:43.610> optical

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
aluminum this will work with LED optical

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.810 
aluminum this will work with LED optical
sensors<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.320> laser<00:03:45.470> sensors<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.760> is

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
sensors and the laser sensors this is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.010 
sensors and the laser sensors this is
what<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.060> like<00:03:47.240> about<00:03:47.360> it<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.600> most<00:03:47.630> on<00:03:47.930> the

going anywhere so to sum it up the mouse

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.250 
going anywhere so to sum it up the mouse
is<00:04:00.290> extremely<00:04:00.890> comfortable<00:04:01.100> ergonomic<00:04:02.260> it's

mean the features are just a complete
overkill<00:04:07.250> but<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.330> bottom<00:04:08.570> line<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.840> is<00:04:08.959> that

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
overkill but the bottom line is is that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.510 
overkill but the bottom line is is that
it's<00:04:09.170> very<00:04:09.230> comfortable<00:04:09.770> and<00:04:09.860> very<00:04:10.070> accurate
