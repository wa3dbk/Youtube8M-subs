 I wanted to tell you as a waiter 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.260

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.600
 I knew that I committed myself to life 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150
 but at 15 years old 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 So lucky 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150

 they can not leave because they are already very old 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
