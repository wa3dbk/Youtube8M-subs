of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> best<00:00:29.330> action<00:00:30.330> figures<00:00:31.019> I've<00:00:31.260> ever<00:00:31.500> had

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of the best action figures I've ever had

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.479 
of the best action figures I've ever had
I<00:00:33.590> definitely<00:00:34.590> better<00:00:34.890> than<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
I definitely better than a lot of the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.720 
I definitely better than a lot of the
Power<00:00:35.760> Ranger<00:00:36.090> toys<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.079> oh<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.370> like

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
Power Ranger toys that I have oh I like

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.470 
Power Ranger toys that I have oh I like
those<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.420> cuz<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> power<00:00:40.800> ranger<00:00:40.980> fan

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
those more cuz I'm a power ranger fan

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.549 
those more cuz I'm a power ranger fan
but<00:00:42.480> uh<00:00:43.670> as<00:00:44.670> far<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> figure<00:00:45.660> goes<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
but uh as far as this figure goes it is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.450 
but uh as far as this figure goes it is
perfect<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.370> play<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:47.789> ah<00:00:48.980> I'm<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
perfect for play down ah I'm going to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.270 
perfect for play down ah I'm going to
dive<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:50.700> into<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.960> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
dive right into this so here we go the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.380 
dive right into this so here we go the
articulation<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.629> fairly<00:00:57.629> basic<00:00:58.760> though<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
articulation is fairly basic though it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.080 
articulation is fairly basic though it
is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.050> further<00:01:01.469> than<00:01:01.800> most<00:01:02.699> toys

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is a little bit further than most toys

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
is a little bit further than most toys
on<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.339> knee<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.270> hip<00:01:07.189> articulation<00:01:08.189> um

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
on it as knee and hip articulation um

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
on it as knee and hip articulation um
but<00:01:10.110> due<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> transformation<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.240> knees

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
but due to the transformation the knees

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:25.490 
but due to the transformation the knees
can<00:01:13.110> bend<00:01:15.530> very<00:01:16.530> far<00:01:17.390> um<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> UH<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:24.500> elbows

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
can bend very far um the UH the elbows

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.830 
can bend very far um the UH the elbows
get<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> same<00:01:26.040> treatment<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:32.150> hips<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
get the same treatment and the hips and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
get the same treatment and the hips and
the<00:01:35.509> shoulders<00:01:36.920> are<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:40.549> ball<00:01:41.549> joint<00:01:41.579> as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the shoulders are on a ball joint as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.740 
the shoulders are on a ball joint as
well<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.350> hinge<00:01:44.070> joint<00:01:44.490> giving<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
well as a hinge joint giving them a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.120 
well as a hinge joint giving them a
fairly<00:01:46.200> wide<00:01:46.439> range<00:01:46.860> um<00:01:48.470> for<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
fairly wide range um for the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.690 
fairly wide range um for the
transformation<00:01:50.610> arm<00:01:52.460> because<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
transformation arm because of the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.469 
transformation arm because of the
transformation<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.850> figure<00:02:00.180> doesn't

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
transformation on the the figure doesn't

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
transformation on the the figure doesn't
have<00:02:00.810> wise<00:02:02.270> arm<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.780> arm<00:02:04.189> or<00:02:06.200> very<00:02:07.200> wide<00:02:07.670> going

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
have wise arm to arm or very wide going

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.110 
have wise arm to arm or very wide going
out

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
out

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.080 
out
range<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.990> uh<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.840> works<00:02:15.170> very<00:02:16.069> well<00:02:16.250> play

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
range but uh it it works very well play

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.720 
range but uh it it works very well play
value<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.720> thing<00:02:17.989> will<00:02:18.680> hold<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.400> very

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
value this thing will hold up for a very

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.170 
value this thing will hold up for a very
long<00:02:20.060> time<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:21.050> did<00:02:21.319> not<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:22.459> any<00:02:22.730> kind<00:02:23.030> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
long time this did not have any kind of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.870 
long time this did not have any kind of
breakage<00:02:23.630> until<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:25.780> was<00:02:28.300> 13<00:02:29.300> or<00:02:29.569> 14<00:02:30.520> uh-huh<00:02:31.520> not

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
breakage until I was 13 or 14 uh-huh not

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.500 
breakage until I was 13 or 14 uh-huh not
from<00:02:32.180> playing<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.470> from<00:02:34.510> transforming

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
from playing with it from transforming

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.740 
from playing with it from transforming
it<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:36.670> don't<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.819> play<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.209> toys<00:02:38.420> anymore

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
it I don't really play with toys anymore

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.390 
it I don't really play with toys anymore
I<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.019> kind<00:02:39.319> of<00:02:39.349> transformed<00:02:39.920> them<00:02:40.010> back<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I just kind of transformed them back and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.460 
I just kind of transformed them back and
forth<00:02:40.610> because<00:02:41.450> most<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.900> my<00:02:42.019> toys<00:02:42.319> are

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
forth because most of my toys are

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.420 
forth because most of my toys are
transforming<00:02:43.160> toys<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.980> kind<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> keeps

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
transforming toys and that kind of keeps

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.130 
transforming toys and that kind of keeps
up<00:02:51.640> hand-eye<00:02:52.640> coordination<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.110> that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
up hand-eye coordination and I like that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.620 
up hand-eye coordination and I like that
um<00:02:55.989> let's<00:02:56.989> go<00:02:57.670> into<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> transformation<00:02:59.090> now

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
um let's go into the transformation now

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.059 
um let's go into the transformation now
the<00:03:00.560> transformation<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.430> fairly<00:03:01.910> easy<00:03:02.030> ah

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
the transformation is fairly easy ah

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.759 
the transformation is fairly easy ah
first<00:03:04.069> fold<00:03:04.580> out<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.000> wings<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.590> back

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
first fold out the wings on the back

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:18.509 
first fold out the wings on the back
here<00:03:08.290> they<00:03:09.290> could<00:03:10.090> turn<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.650> AH<00:03:14.470> flip<00:03:15.470> out<00:03:15.650> on

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.860 

a<00:03:19.519> hinge<00:03:20.150> joint<00:03:20.630> um<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:22.489> say<00:03:22.910> they<00:03:23.060> turn<00:03:23.359> because

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
a hinge joint um I say they turn because

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.050 
a hinge joint um I say they turn because
I<00:03:25.299> say<00:03:26.299> they<00:03:26.450> kind<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:27.370> twist<00:03:28.370> because<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.940> this

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I say they kind of twist because of this

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.340 
I say they kind of twist because of this
um<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:33.260> fold<00:03:34.250> them<00:03:34.400> out<00:03:34.519> there<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:38.350> fold
