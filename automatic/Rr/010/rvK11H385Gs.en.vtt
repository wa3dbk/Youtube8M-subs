00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.320 
see the tube we can see it all right all
right<00:01:44.010> over<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> tube<00:01:44.910> real<00:01:45.120> quick

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
right over to see the tube real quick

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.160 
right over to see the tube real quick
let's<00:01:45.870> go<00:01:46.080> man

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.810 

now<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.799> course<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.400> much<00:01:51.670> higher

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
now of course it's a much higher

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.280 
now of course it's a much higher
capacity<00:01:52.360> than<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.689> wildebeest<00:01:53.049> because<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
capacity than the wildebeest because the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.570 
capacity than the wildebeest because the
world<00:01:53.439> peace<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.740> three<00:01:54.040> or<00:01:54.159> four<00:01:54.310> person

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
world peace is a three or four person

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.850 
world peace is a three or four person
raft<00:01:54.729> isn't<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.750> four-person<00:01:56.530> linear

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
raft isn't it it's a four-person linear

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.429 
raft isn't it it's a four-person linear
raft<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.700> that's<00:01:58.570> got<00:01:58.780> about<00:01:58.960> seven<00:01:59.409> hundred

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
raft so that's got about seven hundred

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.800 
raft so that's got about seven hundred
riders<00:02:00.009> per<00:02:00.220> hour<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.330> going<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.720> be

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
riders per hour so this is going to be

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.170 
riders per hour so this is going to be
about<00:02:01.899> 1100<00:02:02.710> riders<00:02:03.040> per<00:02:03.220> hour<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.939> total

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
about 1100 riders per hour so in total

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.539 
about 1100 riders per hour so in total
