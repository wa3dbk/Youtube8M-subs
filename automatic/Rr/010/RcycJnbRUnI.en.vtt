00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.010
 tells crowd that eric is because today 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.280
 talk again a bit you is 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.779
 theme of this video today will be about the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.290
 ltz 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.290
 and this absurd evolution has 13 had is 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.960
 for those who do not know is that it started and 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.520
 giving players a little of the old and 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.989
 united came out at night we had 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.760
 publish is dioxide and the game was cot 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.530
 then these three players they 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.830
 remained the game as a coach 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 He turned anguish and desire to create 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.270
 djoko the tocantins and yang was the top 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.390
 lenny 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 then this team is how this team 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.950
 nothing like United is not a 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.570
 very absurd team united made some 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.239
 good games against ugly but it was not a 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.770
 very strong type is a team that had 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.700
 was practically to complete the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.680
 table and from nowhere and mtv came up the hypothesis 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.400
 arrived well to bring arrived at the end of 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.650
 last year having good games is her 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.800
 arrived to get 3rd place in some 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.330
 championships type is reverse harem is like 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.100
 with the championships like this and this year I 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.110
 going year is first received the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.229
 side of the cage is presenting a level 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.620
 play the absurd then how was the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.000
 evolution of players is first to 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.930
 talk a little bit about each player in the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.540
 mtv is in the beginning before the revolt enter 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.659
 we had a micuna that the player who 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.570
 It is very old and he has matured 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 in the last year so he is a player 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 so he was always there never 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.159
 No team has ever hovered a sim never 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.860
 really was featured 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.510
 it's game time that's kind of known 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.670
 as one of the guys who sack the most 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.240
 competitive a very smart player 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 and such is Uncle Yang who was a revelation and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.880
 still made decisions and arrived at en13 playing 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.310
 very well 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.410
 It has evolved a lot in the tourist is considered 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.180
 he is revealing 2014 has jorge 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 sotter that is the support that was already 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.640
 with me for a long time he plays micton 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.720
 are always together, and so is the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.090
 dioxide and the touch them because news katie 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.330
 only then did the two together evolve 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 a lot in the last six months 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.840
 especially on topics such as I had 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.670
 spoken in another video and online media 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.130
 mediaon law is the law in which the most evolved 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.739
 in brazil and touches it finally arrived 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.480
 on the level he has now been in is 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.700
 level 4 to 1 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.810
 is he made four in the water along with the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.790
 cami takeshi new then i 'm a player and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.090
 have evolved a lot and now in this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.910
 year type ah it performs type year then the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.780
 what happened that made this team change 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.849
 the first is when they turned n300 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.860
 a stop that is very important to 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.500
 inter the players will receive structure 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.319
 the difference this player rai 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.200
 united from three players now goes on tv 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 is that now they have structure they put 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.970
 There is a game house he received from the game. 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.310
 even commented in the podcast with me that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.319
 when in his case tv to talk about 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.139
 proposal of the organization and 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.910
 they even thought it would be famous type 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:31.980
 when connecting the rolling very sport and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.989
 It would be as you say he had tried to give the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.209
 blow on them that 6 that it all 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.030
 they promised but got there and had 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.760
 so they were pntl system have a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 game house they had is a team by 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.920
 have had people working with 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.510
 marketing people had happy people like 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.079
 I can speak and receive structure 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.239
 was monstrous and this was the 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.470
 these players evolve so much then 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.420
 As I told myself with a guy I was 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.730
 always there beating the afternoon just not now 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.410
 is recognizing a micuna so only 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
 now the guys consider one of the best 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.180
 because that finally it has structure 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.739
 have investment on top of it 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.420
 this is a business so it showed 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.760
 really a team to grow with the team 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.159
 coming to fall 1 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.620
 and good players and we need to see chips 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.090
 to give a structure is absurd for them 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.739
 because these players can grow 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.150
 enough 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.889
 is who the details of which type to inter 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.710
 arrived worked a lot with marketing that 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.289
 This disrupts the elastic 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.880
 players they reach them they 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.650
 got twisted know I did not see the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.479
 united twist in it since the year 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.970
 past we already had the players already 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.130
 had many fans know mtv already 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.460
 there are many fans so help 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.400
 too expensive to imagine being a player 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.199
 you kind win you are the man can there 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.449
 type on twitter and a facebook page 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.370
 that no one there who won the game knows 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.220
 what kind the guys are cool and knowledgeable 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.470
 of a lot of people there sending some kind 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.810
 so this is very important in mtv a 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.270
 organization did very well in this. 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.270
 This is essential for me now I have 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.060
 another thing that was the output of the game and 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.710
 entrance of revolt 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.810
 the revolt is being very upset in the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.490
 last year last year by 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.280
 cause of the most such revolt 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.630
 He has always been an excellent player and 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.070
 type inscreen i ii and ii solo he 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.250
 always been a monster the guys always 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.470
 said that revolt is this strange type 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.449
 that the laws that he ended up with the game is 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.130
 type scheme while another team and 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.160
 they got competitive he needs to stay 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.990
 nervous and such and I think last year 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.580
 started with a very great pressure that 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.860
 It was only increasing up back 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.590
 This year he is playing without pressure. 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.060
 understood when you change teams 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.860
 you get this impression if you do not have any more 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.960
 the pressure you are throwing on a 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.210
 team that there is a name with the crew of 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.820
 charging 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.440
 he was arrested in thesis that backpack that 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.940
 he had on his back that way. 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.849
 that's how I can talk 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.770
 this pressure he had diminished and 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.139
 it is lighter and back is another that 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.060
 back to being aggressive revolt not having 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.669
 fear he is being the scandal for 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.199
 time up and is probably being 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:15.330
 best angle of the island side if 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.980
 received so far so this too is 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.900
 very important 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.850
 I figured the game exit is 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.530
 work hard because as I said to 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.030
 game was the head of the team was the heart 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.700
 of the team, right? 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.520
 is he also the teacher who left 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.650
 for the old coaching is I figured that 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.060
 this would ruin quite a few times 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.720
 mtv could not remain is playing 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.010
 in high level even without game exit 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.370
 so today the video will not be very 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.870
 long is not the idea but this is 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.050
 information you leave a comment 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.580
 who are cleaning this year and that 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.410
 you think of this importance of 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.650
 structure that is to organize 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.690
 the players then this is it folks if
