after<00:05:12.780> my<00:05:13.020> foundation<00:05:13.500> probably<00:05:13.890> because<00:05:14.250> the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
after my foundation probably because the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.220 
after my foundation probably because the
foundation<00:05:14.760> would<00:05:15.090> go<00:05:15.270> on<00:05:15.450> my<00:05:15.630> Carmex<00:05:16.020> and

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
foundation would go on my Carmex and

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.150 
foundation would go on my Carmex and
