00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.580 

physical<00:00:07.890> silver<00:00:08.099> supply<00:00:08.370> same<00:00:09.030> chart<00:00:09.630> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
physical silver supply same chart and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.419 
physical silver supply same chart and
this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> from<00:00:11.160> oo<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:12.380> 210<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:13.950> see<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
this is from oo to 210 you can see that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.580 
this is from oo to 210 you can see that
demand<00:00:15.150> has<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> sort<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.900> supply<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> risen

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
demand has a sort of supply is risen

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
demand has a sort of supply is risen
from<00:00:16.770> let's<00:00:17.490> call<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.960> 562<00:00:19.550> around<00:00:20.550> 700<00:00:21.180> so

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
from let's call it 562 around 700 so

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.450 
from let's call it 562 around 700 so
we've<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:21.660> gained<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.560> physical

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we've actually gained some physical

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.240 
we've actually gained some physical
supply<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:24.029> silver<00:00:24.800> but<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> operative

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
supply of silver but the operative

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.589 
supply of silver but the operative
number<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.080> roughly<00:00:29.599> 700

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
number here is we get roughly 700

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
number here is we get roughly 700
million<00:00:30.929> from<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> mines<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.040> let's<00:00:32.969> say<00:00:33.390> we

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
million from the mines and let's say we

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.540 
million from the mines and let's say we
get<00:00:33.840> 200<00:00:34.410> million<00:00:34.710> from<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> cycle<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> don't

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
get 200 million from a cycle I don't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
get 200 million from a cycle I don't
think<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> high<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.420> nine<00:00:36.630> hundreds<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
think it's that high but nine hundreds a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
think it's that high but nine hundreds a
lot<00:00:37.260> easier<00:00:37.739> number<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> work<00:00:38.700> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
lot easier number for you to work with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
lot easier number for you to work with
and<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.620> 862<00:00:41.930> because<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.200> started

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and me then 862 because when we started

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.389 
and me then 862 because when we started
dividing<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.920> gonna<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> problem

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
dividing we're gonna have a problem

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.260 
dividing we're gonna have a problem
right<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.870> 900<00:00:46.789> okay<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.030> same

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
right so let's use 900 okay the same

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.490 
right so let's use 900 okay the same
analysis<00:00:48.899> let's<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.620> back<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> Oh<00:00:50.010> 5<00:00:51.379> we<00:00:52.379> have

fact<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.540> month<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.650> did

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
fact the month we had this one we did

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.120 
fact the month we had this one we did
something<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.630> 4.4<00:01:15.630> million<00:01:15.900> almost<00:01:16.470> 4.5

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
something like 4.4 million almost 4.5

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
something like 4.4 million almost 4.5
million<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> ounces<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.030> September<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
million of ounces in September which is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
million of ounces in September which is
interesting<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> month<00:01:20.640> before<00:01:21.030> we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
interesting I think the month before we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
interesting I think the month before we
might<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.420> done<00:01:21.570> about<00:01:21.750> three<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
might have done about three so and the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330 
might have done about three so and the
year<00:01:23.310> ago<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.670> 1.8<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> demand<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
year ago was 1.8 so the demand is just

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
year ago was 1.8 so the demand is just
exploding<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.450> hope<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:28.259> up

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
exploding in your hope they can keep up

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
exploding in your hope they can keep up
with<00:01:28.619> their<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:29.430> blanks<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.000> sell<00:01:30.240> people

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
with their their blanks and sell people

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.100 
with their their blanks and sell people
as<00:01:30.720> much<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.200> want

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110

the silver ETF now we have a silver ETF
that<00:01:39.390> consumes<00:01:39.869> 100<00:01:40.320> million<00:01:40.619> ounces<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.250> year

that consumes 100 million ounces a year

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.210 
that consumes 100 million ounces a year
presuming<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> 100<00:01:44.040> million

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
presuming they have the 100 million

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.120 
presuming they have the 100 million
ounces<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.840> wonder<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
ounces you know we all wonder about that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
ounces you know we all wonder about that
and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:48.390> still<00:01:48.689> wonder<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.409> whether<00:01:49.649> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and I still wonder about it whether it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
and I still wonder about it whether it's
just<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> paper<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.880> whether<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.360> real

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
just a paper thing or whether the real

so we're we're kind of wondering then we

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670 
so we're we're kind of wondering then we
have<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.360> Delta<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.810> China<00:02:50.170> where<00:02:50.470> they

have the the Delta in China where they
used<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.980> be<00:02:51.040> exporters<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.880> hundred

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
used to be exporters of a hundred

million and now now they're import as a
modern<00:02:55.480> myth<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.690> we<00:02:55.750> got<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> two<00:02:56.110> hundred

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
modern myth so we got a two hundred

a<00:04:21.070> sale<00:04:21.460> so<00:04:21.870> we'll<00:04:22.870> see<00:04:23.110> how<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.290> goes

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
a sale so we'll see how that goes

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.870 
a sale so we'll see how that goes
but<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> physicalness<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:26.140> screaming<00:04:26.680> at<00:04:26.830> you

but the physicalness is screaming at you

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.760 
but the physicalness is screaming at you
that<00:04:27.880> silver<00:04:28.780> has<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.200> go<00:04:29.320> up<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.650> there's

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
that silver has to go up and there's

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.550 
that silver has to go up and there's
other<00:04:29.920> data<00:04:30.370> silver<00:04:31.150> versus<00:04:31.480> gold<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.020> do

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
other data silver versus gold that do

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.070 
other data silver versus gold that do
that<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.520> here's<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.850> chart<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.450> dollar

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that so here's a chart of the dollar

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.310 
that so here's a chart of the dollar
value<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.760> mint<00:04:36.760> silver<00:04:37.330> sales<00:04:37.660> versus<00:04:38.080> gold

sales and the most important thing to

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.250 
sales and the most important thing to
note<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.310> ratio<00:04:42.670> of<00:04:43.000> sales<00:04:43.600> in

ounces<00:05:17.230> of<00:05:17.440> gold<00:05:17.530> produce<00:05:17.980> so<00:05:18.130> we<00:05:18.220> got<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.370> ratio

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
ounces of gold produce so we got a ratio
