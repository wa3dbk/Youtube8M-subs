00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
universe for script - Wow so excited

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
universe for script - Wow so excited
besides<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.269> temperature<00:00:51.839> being<00:00:52.050> pretty

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
besides the temperature being pretty

high this 175 is good this is 86 of 84
like<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> said<00:01:04.649> I<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.920> fine<00:01:05.280> GPU

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
like I said I have fine GPU

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.139 
like I said I have fine GPU
I'm<00:01:08.100> hashing<00:01:08.820> 4<00:01:09.240> point<00:01:09.630> 5<00:01:10.490> mega<00:01:11.490> hashes<00:01:12.119> per

as<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:26.570> Wow

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.390 

this<00:01:31.750> is

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.330 

this<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:35.390> blowing<00:01:35.630> my<00:01:35.840> mind<00:01:36.100> here's<00:01:37.100> my

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
this is just blowing my mind here's my

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.210 
this is just blowing my mind here's my
settings<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.120> use<00:01:38.530> afterburner<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.980> why

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
settings I use afterburner this is why

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.680 
settings I use afterburner this is why
the<00:01:43.540> power<00:01:44.540> limit<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.260> negative<00:01:45.610> 15/4<00:01:47.380> o'clock

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
the power limit is negative 15/4 o'clock

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.170 
the power limit is negative 15/4 o'clock
800<00:01:50.690> yes<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:52.160> 800<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:54.020> stock<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.560> comes

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
800 yes it is 800 think stock it comes

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.860 
800 yes it is 800 think stock it comes
947<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.890> for<00:01:57.890> script<00:01:58.250> mining<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:59.480> want<00:01:59.720> your

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
947 and for script mining you want your

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.260 
947 and for script mining you want your
memory<00:02:00.200> clock<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:01.040> pretty<00:02:01.550> highs<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
memory clock to be pretty highs and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.180 
memory clock to be pretty highs and
people<00:02:02.600> put<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.990> 15<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.740> did<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.130> 16<00:02:04.760> 25<00:02:06.190> fans

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
people put in a 15 I did it 16 25 fans

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.440 
people put in a 15 I did it 16 25 fans
you<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.610> increase<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.480> there's<00:02:08.810> no<00:02:08.990> point

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you can increase it but there's no point

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
you can increase it but there's no point
but<00:02:11.450> memory<00:02:12.050> clock<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.710> want<00:02:12.950> for<00:02:13.310> scrip

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
but memory clock you want for scrip

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.390 
but memory clock you want for scrip
lining<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.330> want<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.960> really<00:02:15.410> high<00:02:15.620> so

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
lining you want it to be really high so

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.470 
lining you want it to be really high so
this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.790> little<00:02:17.060> guys<00:02:18.610> let's<00:02:19.610> ask<00:02:19.940> me

TeamViewer and help you guys out and
this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.090> what<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.450> did<00:02:32.720> 5<00:02:33.050> GPU

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.420 

pretty<00:02:37.990> sweet<00:02:38.290> setup<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.920> did

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.110 

each<00:02:45.030> part<00:02:45.540> after<00:02:46.069> overclocking<00:02:47.069> stock<00:02:47.760> let's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
each part after overclocking stock let's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.649 
each part after overclocking stock let's
say<00:02:48.329> it's<00:02:48.659> it's<00:02:49.200> about<00:02:49.349> 300<00:02:50.250> Watts<00:02:50.549> when<00:02:51.510> you

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
say it's it's about 300 Watts when you

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.679 
say it's it's about 300 Watts when you
overclock<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.709> goes<00:02:53.069> up<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.459> over<00:02:53.790> 400<00:02:54.510> each

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
overclock it it goes up to over 400 each

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.660 
overclock it it goes up to over 400 each
part<00:02:55.099> so<00:02:56.099> if<00:02:56.219> you<00:02:56.370> multiply<00:02:57.200> five<00:02:58.200> by<00:02:58.430> 400<00:02:59.430> plus

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
part so if you multiply five by 400 plus

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.030 
part so if you multiply five by 400 plus
a<00:02:59.700> compute<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.299> other<00:03:00.480> hundred<00:03:00.840> Watts<00:03:01.040> that's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a compute in other hundred Watts that's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.500 
a compute in other hundred Watts that's
20<00:03:02.959> 100<00:03:03.959> watts<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:06.560> have<00:03:07.560> 60<00:03:08.250> more<00:03:08.459> 1600<00:03:09.359> Watts

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
20 100 watts I have 60 more 1600 Watts

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.860 
20 100 watts I have 60 more 1600 Watts
how's<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.049> possible

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
how's it possible

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.110 
how's it possible
I'll<00:03:12.349> tell<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.769> how<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:15.440> answer<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.970> got

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
I'll tell you how the answer is you got

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.320 
I'll tell you how the answer is you got
Underwood<00:03:17.629> once<00:03:18.590> you're<00:03:18.769> on<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.010> wall

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
Underwood once you're on the wall

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.830 
Underwood once you're on the wall
everything<00:03:20.330> just<00:03:20.599> drops<00:03:21.370> each<00:03:22.510> one<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.629> those

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
everything just drops each one of those

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.710 
everything just drops each one of those
cards<00:03:24.410> is<00:03:25.450> outputting<00:03:29.170> 240<00:03:30.170> watts<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:32.480> can

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
cards is outputting 240 watts so I can

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.199 
cards is outputting 240 watts so I can
easily<00:03:32.930> even<00:03:33.500> use<00:03:33.830> 1500<00:03:34.760> watt<00:03:35.420> power<00:03:35.720> supply

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
easily even use 1500 watt power supply

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.670 
easily even use 1500 watt power supply
this<00:03:38.209> is<00:03:38.330> this<00:03:38.510> guy's<00:03:38.840> let<00:03:39.260> me<00:03:39.379> know<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.620> you
