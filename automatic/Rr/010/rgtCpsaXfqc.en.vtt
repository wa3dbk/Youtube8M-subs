of meandering pathways

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.680 
of meandering pathways
I've<00:00:19.650> done<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.890> lot<00:00:20.190> of<00:00:20.250> digging<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.120> getting

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
out the line

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.140 
out the line
but<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.789> found<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.420> method

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
but I found a method

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.840 
but I found a method
we'll<00:00:25.650> break<00:00:26.650> down<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.160> lawn<00:00:27.340> it's<00:00:27.610> called

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.040 
we'll break down the lawn it's called
layering<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:31.420> just<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.779> matter<00:00:31.960> of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
layering and it's just a matter of

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.049 
layering and it's just a matter of
putting<00:00:32.290> organic<00:00:32.920> materials<00:00:33.400> on<00:00:33.550> top<00:00:33.790> of<00:00:33.970> each

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.050 

and<00:01:26.409> certainly<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.250> most<00:01:27.400> common<00:01:27.850> thing<00:01:28.030> to

and certainly the most common thing to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.750 
and certainly the most common thing to
use<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.390> just<00:01:29.020> your<00:01:29.229> basic<00:01:29.409> newspaper<00:01:30.070> have

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
always dropping it off for me because I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.680 
always dropping it off for me because I
