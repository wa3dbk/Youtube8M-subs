00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.770
 the company Kids Touring warmly welcomes you to this video 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.940
 them by hand 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.100
 now show the following sequences as the test results 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.100
 have failed 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.550
 From the scenes shown now show how important is 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.550
 what a trailer has a reasonable height 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.079
 Here our Kids Store scores top over the finished products 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.619
 the bikes were provided with weights 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.579
 Furthermore, in the trailer was an appointment with a weight of about 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.070
 set ten kilos 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.720
 to the behavior in a side impact with different 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 To simulate speeds 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 despite 53 kilometers per hour 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.690
 he just gave himself such a job on the suspension 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 and at the drawbar the passenger compartment has remained intact 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.619
 Buy at tempo 25 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.180
 our quiz gate 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 is completely pushed away 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.270
 the passenger compartment has remained stable 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.580
 that is the most important insight 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.170
 through the circulating doblo per space n 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.990
 Values ​​that also with forces 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 absorbed 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.250
 But the most important thing is not to put Tami in the lap 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.390
 remained intact 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.590
 now an impact speed of many 50 km / h 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.830
 Result deformations AMD double forms 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.549
 and only one pearl on offer 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.820
 the ALOS security guard 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.820
 Test with 24 no hair 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.930
 each vulnerability is analyzed via sensors points on the trailer 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.309
 and recorded on multiple camera settings 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.469
 the deformations are photographed to provide sufficient data 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.459
 to get for the evaluation 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.560
 Recurring impact scenarios confirm that the frame is the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.780
 Forces absorbed 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.939
 and that's me coming in contact with the car 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 pay attention to ball 50 km / h 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.459
 and comparative tests have proven 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.049
 the druchbruch come 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.489
 the passenger compartment would be stable 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.529
 only the verdict is torn 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.200
 the child is safe and secure 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 in our neighborhood tourer 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.979
 how does a Schiener product behave at only 25 Palma 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.029
 which partners and safety risks in a product 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.059
 China arise 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.599
 Pages the shots 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.059
 on impact knock off the wheels of the trailer 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.699
 Due to the low center of gravity, the sheep is pulled under the vehicle 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.239
 which inevitably leads to a contact between child and 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.269
 The most serious injuries are due to her 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.249
 how dangerous is a child on the luggage rack of the bicycle with too 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.959
 take these pictures 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.829
 Children do not have a crumple zone here, too, no helmet helps the Verdener in and 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.829
 protects against external injuries 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.569
 We thank the company Weber 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.219
 the this comparison test 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.099
 did not shy away 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.409
 we believe to know why other manufacturers 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.329
 did not want to participate in this test 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.149
 for good reason, as we think 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.049
 here shows itself many times 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 a market without morality 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.899
 we thank our test 7 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.110
 for her tireless work 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.870
 for continuous improvement 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.539
 from our kids tour 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.500
 and hope 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.489
 them with this crash test 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.690
 to have conveyed an impression about our work with the aim of 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.389
 Minimization of risk of danger 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.099
 what other manufacturers set as their goal 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.809
 is natural for us 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.970
 we did our homework 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.439
 and today can be full of pride 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.309
 offer them attachments to a children's bike 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.330
 convinced 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.889
 through robustness 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.139
 security 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.349
 Longevity and value retention 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.930
 Profit is not our main concern Sundern is safe 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.060
 Their child is theirs for the right decision 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.319
 Quality safety 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.780
 and innovations 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.319
 has a name 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.300
