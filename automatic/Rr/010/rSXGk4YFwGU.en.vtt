00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
okay what can I do differently in those

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.379 
okay what can I do differently in those
situations<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.219> be<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:15.549> successful<00:03:15.759> next

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
situations to be more successful next

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.879 
situations to be more successful next
time<00:03:16.509> so<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.109> next<00:03:17.290> time<00:03:17.470> you're<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:17.739> the
