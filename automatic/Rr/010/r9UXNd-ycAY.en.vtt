my fingers I'm just going to blend it in
it's<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.979> easy<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.369> blame<00:01:38.549> because

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
it's really really easy to blame because

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.999 
it's really really easy to blame because
its<00:01:39.060> sides<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.409> feel<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.890> would

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
its sides then and I feel like it would

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.280 
its sides then and I feel like it would
match<00:01:41.250> most<00:01:41.729> skin<00:01:42.210> tones<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
match most skin tones just because it is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
match most skin tones just because it is
so<00:01:43.590> blendable<00:01:44.250> guess<00:01:44.729> now<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.240> done

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so blendable guess now that it is done

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
so blendable guess now that it is done
