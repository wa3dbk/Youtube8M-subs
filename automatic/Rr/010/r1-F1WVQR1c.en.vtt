00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
like your manual zoom up on your lens

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.940 
like your manual zoom up on your lens
here<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.639> quite<00:00:12.030> fast<00:00:12.450> enough<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.530> let<00:00:13.860> me

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
here is not quite fast enough so let me

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
here is not quite fast enough so let me
just<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> takes<00:00:15.450> me<00:00:15.599> almost<00:00:15.870> like

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
just show you so it takes me almost like

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.380 
just show you so it takes me almost like
an<00:00:16.260> entire<00:00:16.590> half<00:00:17.160> turn<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.850> zoom<00:00:18.029> all<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.240> way

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
an entire half turn to zoom all the way

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.820 
an entire half turn to zoom all the way
in<00:00:18.630> which<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.960> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.199> awkward<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.650> your

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
hand if you want to go really far it's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.960 
hand if you want to go really far it's
only<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.830> comfortable<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.640> zoom<00:00:23.789> like

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
only really comfortable to zoom like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and it's just kind of awkward to to go

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.750 
and it's just kind of awkward to to go
all<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> way<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.369> let<00:00:29.519> me<00:00:29.609> show

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.269 
all the way out like that so let me show
you<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> put<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.199> high-speed<00:00:31.740> zoom

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you how to put on the high-speed zoom

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.240 
you how to put on the high-speed zoom
which<00:00:32.790> takes<00:00:33.059> care<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.540> problem<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> what

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
which takes care of that problem so what

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970 
which takes care of that problem so what
we'll<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.790> we'll<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.570> our<00:00:37.020> menu<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we'll do is we'll go into our menu and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.910 
we'll do is we'll go into our menu and
then<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> scroll<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.469> all<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> way

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
then we want to scroll down all the way

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
then we want to scroll down all the way
to<00:00:41.629> customize<00:00:44.270> from<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to customize from here we want to go to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
to customize from here we want to go to
the<00:00:46.710> custom<00:00:47.129> function<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.780> where

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the custom function and this is where

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.350 
the custom function and this is where
you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.320> set<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.160> whole<00:00:50.969> bunch<00:00:51.500> xx<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.739> exact

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
you can set a whole bunch xx to be exact

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
you can set a whole bunch xx to be exact
custom<00:00:54.360> functions<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.399> one<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
custom functions and one of these is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
custom functions and one of these is
high-speed<00:00:57.000> zoom<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.840> click<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.289> one

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
high-speed zoom so if we click on one

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.090 
high-speed zoom so if we click on one
and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> tune<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and then we want to go to tune which is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
and then we want to go to tune which is
a<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.579> option<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> bottom

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a very next option there at the bottom

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
a very next option there at the bottom
from<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.400> over<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
from here we want to go over to the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
from here we want to go over to the
number<00:01:06.270> 2<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
number 2 and this is where the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.070 
number 2 and this is where the
high-speed<00:01:07.979> zoom<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.990> know

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
high-speed zoom is so if I you know

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740 
high-speed zoom is so if I you know
select<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> I'll<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.760> down<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> I

select that and I'll go down here and I
just<00:01:12.780> scroll<00:01:13.320> down<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.860> turn<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> now

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
just scroll down to turn it on so now

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.170 
just scroll down to turn it on so now
our<00:01:15.630> high-speed<00:01:16.020> zoom<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.700> I'll<00:01:17.909> click

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
close so now our high-speed zoom is on

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
close so now our high-speed zoom is on
and<00:01:36.479> let's<00:01:36.900> take<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> look<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> looks

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and let's take a look at what that looks

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.690 
and let's take a look at what that looks
like<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:39.920> hope<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> lot

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
like I hope you can see it's a lot

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
like I hope you can see it's a lot
faster<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:42.899> getting<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.159> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
faster and I'm getting all the way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490
