00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 chapter 16 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.320
 today a great voice that said from the temple to the seven angels 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.750
 and pours on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.949
 it was the first and we took a little bit on earth 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.099
 and there came a bad and pestilent ulcer on the men who had the mark 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.019
 of the beast and who worshiped his image 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.599
 the second angel poured his cup on the sea and it became blood 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.149
 as dead and died every living thing that was in the sea 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.080
 the third angel poured out his cup on the rivers 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 and over the sources of the waters and they turned into blood 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.580
 and today the angel of the waters that said just him was the one you are and 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.380
 what were you 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.440
 the Saint 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.830
 because you have played these things 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.500
 because they shed the blood of the saints and the prophets also 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 you have given to drink blood because they deserve it 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.690
 there was also another who from the altar said 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.770
 certainly almighty Lord almighty your judgments are true and just 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.620
 the fourth angel poured out his cup on the sun which was given to burn the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.080
 men with fire 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.470
 and the men were burned with the great heat and blasphemous aron the name of God 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 who has power over these plagues and did not repent to give him glory 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.940
 the fifth angel poured out his cup on the throne of the beast 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 and his kingdom was covered with darkness 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.740
 and bit in pain their tongues and blasphemed against the god of heaven by 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.660
 his pains and his ultras 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.600
 and they did not repent of their works 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.659
 the sixth angel poured out his cup on the great euphoric river 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.270
 and the water of this cessation so that the way to the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.860
 kings of the east 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 and I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and the mouth of the beast 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 and from the mouth of the false prophet 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.319
 three unclean spirits like frogs because they are spirits of demons 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.630
 they make signs they went to the kings of the earth all over the world to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.930
 gather them to the battle of that great day of the Almighty God 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.830
 from here I have as a thief 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.800
 Blessed is he who watches and keeps his clothes so that he does not walk naked and see his 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.159
 shame 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.389
 pilot assembled in the place that in Hebrew is called armagedÃ³n 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:22.279
 the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a great voice came out of the temple 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.279
 of the throne heaven saying in fact it is 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 then there were lightning and voices and thunder and a great tremor of earth a 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.739
 earthquake so great which was never there since men have been 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.559
 on earth 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.979
 and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.869
 fell and the granda alpine viloni in memory of the ante of god to give him the 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.429
 cup of the wine of the ardor of his wrath 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.699
 and every island fled and the mountains were not found 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.779
 and an enormous hail fell from heaven upon men, as of the weight of a 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:57.719
 talent 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.079
 and men blaspheme a contradict by the plague of hail 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.409
 because his plate was exceedingly
