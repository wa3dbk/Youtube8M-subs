starts<00:01:51.859> from<00:01:51.890> stopping<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:52.520> Buffalo<00:01:52.909> Bills

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
starts from stopping the Buffalo Bills

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
the passing game and it all operates off

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.790 
the passing game and it all operates off
them<00:02:31.550> being<00:02:31.940> able<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.390> run<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> football

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
them being able to run the football

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.840 
them being able to run the football
surprisingly<00:02:33.800> they<00:02:34.100> did<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> good<00:02:34.430> job<00:02:34.490> up

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
surprisingly they did a good job up

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.310 
surprisingly they did a good job up
front<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.390> was<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> big<00:02:35.930> question<00:02:36.290> mark

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
front that was a big question mark

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.960 
front that was a big question mark
they're<00:02:37.070> going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.430> their<00:02:37.610> hands<00:02:37.850> full

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
they're going to have their hands full

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.760 
they're going to have their hands full
this<00:02:38.390> week<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> better<00:02:39.020> defensive<00:02:39.230> line

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
this week with a better defensive line

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.370 
this week with a better defensive line
of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:41.000> Oakland<00:02:41.420> Raiders<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:41.960> they<00:02:42.170> can

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
of the Oakland Raiders so if they can

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.950 
of the Oakland Raiders so if they can
hold<00:02:43.250> their<00:02:43.400> own<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.880> think<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> Bills<00:02:44.660> have<00:02:44.810> a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
hold their own I think the Bills have a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.510 
hold their own I think the Bills have a
chance<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.410> attack<00:02:45.620> these<00:02:45.800> guys<00:02:46.010> vertically

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
chance to attack these guys vertically

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.040 
chance to attack these guys vertically
the<00:02:46.880> Raiders<00:02:47.180> played<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> lot<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.510> man<00:02:47.810> coverage

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
the Raiders played a lot of man coverage

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.040 
the Raiders played a lot of man coverage
so<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.340> look<00:02:49.520> for<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.180> bills<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.630> attack<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
so it look for the bills to attack the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.780 
so it look for the bills to attack the
middle<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.470> field<00:02:51.500> that's<00:02:52.430> where<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
middle of that field that's where the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.310 
middle of that field that's where the
opportunities<00:02:53.540> are<00:02:53.600> not<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.050> edges

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
opportunities are not on the edges

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
opportunities are not on the edges
because<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> Raiders<00:02:54.740> have<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.890> lot<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.070> speed

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
because the Raiders have a lot of speed

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.770 
because the Raiders have a lot of speed
to<00:02:55.430> run<00:02:55.460> with<00:02:55.700> those<00:02:55.790> wide<00:02:55.970> receivers<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
to run with those wide receivers the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.690 
to run with those wide receivers the
ability<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.470> attack<00:02:57.710> these<00:02:57.860> teams<00:02:58.160> deep<00:02:58.460> down

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
ability to attack these teams deep down

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.250 
ability to attack these teams deep down
the<00:02:58.790> middle<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.090> field<00:02:59.300> that's<00:02:59.930> where<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
the middle of the field that's where the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.360 
the middle of the field that's where the
Bills<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.650> take<00:03:00.830> their<00:03:00.980> chances

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
Bills have to take their chances

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.490 
Bills have to take their chances
defensively<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.420> all<00:03:02.810> about<00:03:02.840> winning<00:03:03.320> on

defensively it's all about winning on
first<00:03:03.740> down<00:03:03.920> if<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.490> went<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.820> first<00:03:05.030> down

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.420 
sex and he's another type of quarterback
like<00:03:14.870> Tony<00:03:15.140> Romo<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.800> checks<00:03:16.100> pressure

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
like Tony Romo that checks pressure

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.550 
like Tony Romo that checks pressure
before<00:03:16.970> he<00:03:17.300> looks<00:03:17.510> up<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> field<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:18.380> if<00:03:18.440> you

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
before he looks up the field so if you

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.800 
before he looks up the field so if you
guys<00:03:18.710> get<00:03:18.920> him<00:03:19.100> looking<00:03:19.430> down<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.880> checking

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
guys get him looking down and checking

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.210 
guys get him looking down and checking
pressure<00:03:20.990> before<00:03:21.170> he<00:03:21.440> stepped<00:03:21.680> back<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.010> pass

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
pressure before he stepped back to pass

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.550 
pressure before he stepped back to pass
that's<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.090> win<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:23.420> their<00:03:23.720> bills<00:03:23.990> defense<00:03:24.410> I

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that's a win for their bills defense I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
that's a win for their bills defense I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.090 
like what I saw last week continue that
defensive<00:03:27.230> aggressiveness<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.980> all

going<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.120> right<00:04:05.239> direction<00:04:05.390> I'm<00:04:05.870> going

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
going in the right direction I'm going

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.840 
going in the right direction I'm going
with<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> Raiders<00:04:06.680> on<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.070> road<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.430> like<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
with the Raiders on the road I like the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.640 
with the Raiders on the road I like the
ground<00:04:08.090> game<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.780> their<00:04:08.930> defensive<00:04:09.470> line

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
ground game I like their defensive line

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.440 
ground game I like their defensive line
a<00:04:09.860> lot<00:04:10.160> better<00:04:10.430> than<00:04:10.580> Kansas<00:04:10.850> City<00:04:11.000> defensive

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
a lot better than Kansas City defensive

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.210 
a lot better than Kansas City defensive
line<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.020> be<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.170> close<00:04:12.440> game<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:12.950> think<00:04:13.130> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
line so be a close game and I think the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.250 
line so be a close game and I think the
rate<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.450> cornerbacks<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.600> secondary

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
rate of cornerbacks and secondary

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.080 
rate of cornerbacks and secondary
players<00:04:15.530> match<00:04:16.070> up<00:04:16.310> well<00:04:16.549> with<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.880> bills

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
players match up well with the bills

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.360 
players match up well with the bills
