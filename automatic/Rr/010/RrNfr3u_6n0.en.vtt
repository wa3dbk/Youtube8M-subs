00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.280 
look as two up and delay but Hogan was
able<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.390> himself<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:42.960> those<00:01:43.020> moves

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
able to get himself out for those moves

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.929 
able to get himself out for those moves
and<00:01:43.439> take<00:01:43.619> those<00:01:43.740> bumps<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.700> see

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and take those bumps but you could see

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
and take those bumps but you could see
how<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.860> watch

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
how it was not if you go back you watch

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
how it was not if you go back you watch
that<00:01:47.100> awkward<00:01:47.430> Hogan<00:01:47.970> looks<00:01:48.210> taking<00:01:48.869> those

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that awkward Hogan looks taking those

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
that awkward Hogan looks taking those
bumps<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.009> imagine<00:01:50.310> Hogan<00:01:50.700> had<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bumps right now imagine Hogan had to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.520 
bumps right now imagine Hogan had to
then<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.299> from<00:01:51.540> being<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> Hogan<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> big

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
then go from being and Hogan was a big

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
then go from being and Hogan was a big
muscle<00:01:52.829> guy<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.790> older<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.329> Cena

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
muscle guy right it was older and Cena

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
muscle guy right it was older and Cena
but<00:01:55.439> still<00:01:55.680> seen<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.280> essentially<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
but still seen as like essentially a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
but still seen as like essentially a
muscle<00:01:57.479> guy<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:58.219> sports<00:01:59.219> entertainment<00:01:59.640> guy

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
take a toll on the body you know it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.020 
take a toll on the body you know it
really<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:08.039> think<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.670> many<00:02:08.759> ways

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
really really has i think in many ways

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
really really has i think in many ways
because<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:09.539> suffered<00:02:10.110> multiple<00:02:10.259> injuries

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
because he suffered multiple injuries

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.199 
because he suffered multiple injuries
since<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.099> started<00:02:11.310> doing<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.730> stuff<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
since he started doing that stuff you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
since he started doing that stuff you
know<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.870> he's<00:02:12.989> not<00:02:13.140> being<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> most

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
know and he's not being the most

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.580 
know and he's not being the most
these<00:02:14.270> injury-prone<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:16.050> he's<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.410> been

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
these injury-prone but he's not been

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.400 
these injury-prone but he's not been
somebody<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.130> her<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.940> know<00:02:18.090> Rob<00:02:18.960> Van<00:02:19.110> Dam

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
somebody like her you know Rob Van Dam

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.140 
somebody like her you know Rob Van Dam
for<00:02:19.620> example<00:02:20.070> who's<00:02:20.220> obviously<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.670> lot<00:02:20.880> one

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
for example who's obviously a lot one

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.120 
for example who's obviously a lot one
major<00:02:21.660> injury<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.410> other<00:02:22.590> times<00:02:22.860> just

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
major injury in there other times just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.040 
major injury in there other times just
made<00:02:23.310> out<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.580> rubber<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.360> know<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> think

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
made out of rubber you know so I think

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.240 
made out of rubber you know so I think
that's<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> take<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> massive<00:02:25.860> tolling

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's going to take a massive tolling

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
that's going to take a massive tolling
him<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.520> think<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.850> will<00:02:26.940> actually<00:02:27.120> limit

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
him and I think that will actually limit

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.020 
him and I think that will actually limit
that<00:02:28.230> ring<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> style<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.850> know<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that ring of on a style you know the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.430 
that ring of on a style you know the
finger<00:02:30.300> ring<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.600> honor<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:30.960> don't<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.320> as

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
finger ring of honor they don't do as

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.890 
finger ring of honor they don't do as
many<00:02:31.590> shows<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.640> wre<00:02:33.030> does<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.600> they

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
many shows as that wre does and they

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.160 
many shows as that wre does and they
don't<00:02:34.050> have<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.350> many<00:02:34.440> big<00:02:34.800> matches<00:02:35.310> right<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
a little thing that had been surgically

a little thing that had been surgically
implanted<00:02:47.040> into<00:02:47.550> his<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:48.000> which

electronically released morphine into

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.880 
electronically released morphine into
his<00:02:51.000> system<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.840> deal<00:02:52.020> with<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> pain<00:02:52.530> he<00:02:52.740> was

his system to deal with the pain he was

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.610 
his system to deal with the pain he was
out<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.750> true<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.440> there

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
out right that it true it was there

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.100 
out right that it true it was there
stitched<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.570> just<00:02:57.720> crazy<00:02:57.930> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
stitched in and and it's just crazy and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.420 
stitched in and and it's just crazy and
you<00:02:58.260> think<00:02:58.470> man<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:58.800> that's<00:02:58.950> from<00:02:59.130> being<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you think man but that's from being a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.070 
you think man but that's from being a
big<00:02:59.640> guy<00:02:59.880> who's<00:03:00.210> dropping<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.690> leg<00:03:00.870> doing

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
big guy who's dropping the leg doing

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900 
big guy who's dropping the leg doing
what<00:03:01.290> kind<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.560> stuff<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.700> toll

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
what kind of stuff so I think the toll

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.190 
what kind of stuff so I think the toll
that<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.240> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> take<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:03.720> scene<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.080> going

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that is going to take on scene is going

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200 
that is going to take on scene is going
to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.350> quite<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> dramatic<00:03:04.800> one<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.550> much<00:03:06.180> like
