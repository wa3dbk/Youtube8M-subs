 Although shows you my make-up collection 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.020
 and make-up keeping of it had 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.610

 am satisfied and have you all 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 wanted to video and now I am 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 I keep my make-up in this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 Much memories of her and I wanted 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 You absolutely have to stand in my room 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 and then I thought that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.000
 I also do it quite well as a make-up 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 could be suitable for storage and therefore 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 I've done that on two 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 It therefore also very spacious 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 and on top of that is one more 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 storage space , for example , I gave this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 also again later 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 and I would say we start now 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.070
 just with the brush category and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 as synonymous with the first storage for 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 The brush specifically I keep mine 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 every case have a lamp and me 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.459

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.150
 piece 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.989
 side and then it looks from the inside 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.670
 From what you see I have such ikea 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.769

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.310
 I like to protect my make-up 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.019
 Here you can see her from above 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.939
 and now let's go to the individual 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.659
 categories from and first the 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.099

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.260
 I already have a lot there 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.450
 mascara but not too many 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.030
 but first of all of course first 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.129
 my beloved eyelash curler and then 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.620

 sample from lancome so everything is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.959
 represent 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.120
 and then I have mine too 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.579
 Eyelash glue really is the best 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.439
 eyelash glue single eyelashes of essens 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.389
 and then also three pairs of eyelashes 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.639
 cherry but I do not wear it that way 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.290
 often because they are something very noticeable 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.060
 and then we'll just do it 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 the next category and indeed 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.400
 lipgloss then I have a few 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.019
 piece and that a very expensive brand 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.359
 no idea of what is but one 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.579
 absolute flop product then if I 5 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.430
 then lipgloss of cosmetics cosmos 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.919
 I still live in Manhattan Lancome 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.379
 essens zuewa beauty uk and so the whole 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.720
 Scratch the eyeshadows so now only 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.579

 not always exactly what 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.769
 Product is too long for that 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.470
 I would personally take a look 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.840
 also prefer such overview videos of 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.849
 Make-up collection instead of every single one 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.040
 to see product once because he is doing it 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.109
