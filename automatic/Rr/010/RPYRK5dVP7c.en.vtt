thought that side jobs will be similar
there'd<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.020> stuff<00:01:13.080> inside<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> missions

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
there'd be stuff inside the missions

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
there'd be stuff inside the missions
themselves<00:01:14.220> maybe<00:01:14.850> something<00:01:15.390> players<00:01:15.630> did

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
themselves maybe something players did

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
themselves maybe something players did
anyways<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.970> net<00:01:18.210> some

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
anyways or could do that would net some

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyways or could do that would net some
extra<00:01:18.659> profit<00:01:19.049> maybe<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.770> could<00:01:19.920> activate<00:01:20.310> an

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
extra profit maybe you could activate an

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980 
extra profit maybe you could activate an
objective<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> could<00:01:21.360> kidnap<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
bank manager for extra money maybe you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
bank manager for extra money maybe you
could<00:01:24.600> turn<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.930> unhealthy<00:01:25.560> habit<00:01:26.220> of
