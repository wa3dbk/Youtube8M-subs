dual SIM connectivity or you can have

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.779 
dual SIM connectivity or you can have
expandable<00:01:01.949> storage<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.670> two

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
expandable storage there are two

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
expandable storage there are two
versions<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.359> device<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.660> come<00:01:04.049> with

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
versions of this device that come with

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.149 
versions of this device that come with
the<00:01:04.290> 16<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.830> 32<00:01:05.220> 16<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.820> 64<00:01:06.210> t<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.570> built<00:01:06.780> in

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
the 16 or 32 16 or 64 t to be built in

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.590 
the 16 or 32 16 or 64 t to be built in
so<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> decent<00:01:08.850> look<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> the

so you get a decent look at the the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
so you get a decent look at the the
overall<00:01:09.840> design<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.520> course

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
overall design there and you of course

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
overall design there and you of course
have<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> usual<00:01:12.210> cutouts<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.110> antennas<00:01:13.860> as

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have the usual cutouts for antennas as

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
have the usual cutouts for antennas as
well<00:01:14.159> pairing<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> device<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
well pairing the device on it would be a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
well pairing the device on it would be a
familiar<00:01:16.439> experience<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.640> anyone<00:01:17.909> who's<00:01:18.030> used
