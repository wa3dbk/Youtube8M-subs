whatever so i'm just going to go to the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.640 
whatever so i'm just going to go to the
application<00:00:22.560> now<00:00:23.779> I've<00:00:24.779> played<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
application now I've played it for a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.120 
application now I've played it for a
little<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.220> far<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.680> right<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> bat

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
little bit so far and right off the bat

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.540 
little bit so far and right off the bat
though<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.449> text<00:00:30.840> its<00:00:31.619> fits<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.399> theme

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
though the text its fits with the theme

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.069 
though the text its fits with the theme
but<00:00:33.540> yeah<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:34.950> block<00:00:35.309> loading<00:00:35.760> thing

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
but yeah that little block loading thing

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
but yeah that little block loading thing
it<00:00:37.079> needs<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> word<00:00:38.040> loading<00:00:39.110> anyway

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it needs to have the word loading anyway

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.100 
it needs to have the word loading anyway
right<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> cave<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
right now I'm just in a cave right you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
right now I'm just in a cave right you
can<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.710> stuff<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> things<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.450> don't

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
can do stuff one of the things I don't

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.830 
can do stuff one of the things I don't
like<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.620> guess<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.910> fits<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.510> most

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
like but I guess it fits with most

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.670 
like but I guess it fits with most
Facebook<00:00:49.739> Applications<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> fact<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
Facebook Applications is the fact that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.020 
Facebook Applications is the fact that
you<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.160> energy<00:00:54.980> personally<00:00:55.980> I'd<00:00:56.430> prefer<00:00:56.760> if

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you have energy personally I'd prefer if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
you have energy personally I'd prefer if
energy<00:00:57.270> were<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.739> plus<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.280> per

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
energy were to go up one plus one per

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.429 
energy were to go up one plus one per
minute<00:01:00.090> rather<00:01:00.329> than<00:01:00.570> every<00:01:00.930> five<00:01:01.170> minutes

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
minute rather than every five minutes

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.340 
minute rather than every five minutes
okay<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.790> walk<00:01:06.119> around<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> ches<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
okay so you can walk around in ches and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.460 
okay so you can walk around in ches and
whatever<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.790> go<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.479> town

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.249 

one<00:01:13.470> okay<00:01:13.740> well<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.479> interesting

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
one okay well this is a bit interesting

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.910 
one okay well this is a bit interesting
overnight<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:17.159> stuff<00:01:17.490> has<00:01:17.670> appeared<00:01:18.920> I'm

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
overnight some stuff has appeared I'm

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
overnight some stuff has appeared I'm
guessing<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:21.420> buildings<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.140> making

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
guessing that these buildings are making

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
guessing that these buildings are making
these<00:01:22.710> oars<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.430> whatever<00:01:25.909> or<00:01:26.909> something<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these oars or whatever or something I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.670 
don't know but you but uh these blocks
dish<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.860> showed<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.610> overnight<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.320> that's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
dish just showed up overnight so that's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
dish just showed up overnight so that's
a<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:34.920> interesting<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.590> actually

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
a bit interesting so you don't actually

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.910 
a bit interesting so you don't actually
have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.670> mining<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.360> whatever<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.079> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have to do mining or whatever in your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.609 
have to do mining or whatever in your
own<00:01:41.750> or<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> caves<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.680> whatever<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.600> yeah

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
own or in the caves or whatever and yeah

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
own or in the caves or whatever and yeah
one<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.130> issues<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> tutorial

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
one of the little issues is the tutorial

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.200 
one of the little issues is the tutorial
it's<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.229> vague<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:51.000> ice<00:01:51.180> ax

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it's bit vague but there is an ice ax

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.530 
it's bit vague but there is an ice ax
torial<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.170> least<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.540> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
torial and at least there is one it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.359 
torial and at least there is one it's
just<00:01:55.049> point<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> click<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> tutorial

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
just point and click for the tutorial

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
just point and click for the tutorial
for<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> most<00:01:57.180> part<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.360> population

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
for the most part and the population

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
for the most part and the population
seems<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.829> friend<00:02:02.250> base<00:02:03.890> right<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.820> can

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
seems to be friend base right so you can

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.050 
seems to be friend base right so you can
invite<00:02:06.329> some<00:02:06.689> whatever

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.320 

so<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.510> I<00:02:10.630> said<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.020> game<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.470> pretty<00:02:11.710> new

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so like I said this game is pretty new

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.240 
so like I said this game is pretty new
the<00:02:13.330> weight<00:02:13.510> set<00:02:13.540> up<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.290> guessing<00:02:15.070> it's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the weight set up I'm guessing it's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.730 
the weight set up I'm guessing it's
going<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.520> do<00:02:15.640> fairly<00:02:16.030> well<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
going to do fairly well right one of the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.860 
going to do fairly well right one of the
issues<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.550> text<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.270> bit<00:02:22.450> hard<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
issues is the text it's a bit hard to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.620 
issues is the text it's a bit hard to
read<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.820> goes<00:02:24.820> along<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> whole

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
read but it's goes along with the whole

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.500 
read but it's goes along with the whole
theme<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:27.250> predicting<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.760> game<00:02:28.120> might<00:02:28.330> do

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
theme I'm predicting this game might do

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.330 
theme I'm predicting this game might do
well<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:29.050> really<00:02:29.290> depends<00:02:29.770> on<00:02:29.920> how<00:02:30.160> much

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
well that really depends on how much

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.150 
well that really depends on how much
advertising<00:02:30.880> they<00:02:31.450> put<00:02:31.660> into<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
advertising they put into it the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.480 
advertising they put into it the
graphics<00:02:33.850> ad<00:02:34.590> go<00:02:35.590> along<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.160> theme

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
graphics ad go along with the theme

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.880 
graphics ad go along with the theme
right<00:02:37.120> I'm<00:02:37.570> pretty<00:02:38.020> sure<00:02:38.200> they<00:02:38.380> purposely

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
right I'm pretty sure they purposely

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.300 
right I'm pretty sure they purposely
made<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.430> bit<00:02:39.610> pixelized<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:42.130> can

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
made it a bit pixelized and you can

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.250 
made it a bit pixelized and you can
create<00:02:42.670> your<00:02:42.760> own<00:02:43.000> objects<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.960> pretty

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
create your own objects it's pretty

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.990 
create your own objects it's pretty
awesome<00:02:45.070> right<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:47.460> I'm<00:02:48.460> just<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> open

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
awesome right so I'm just going to open

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.870 
awesome right so I'm just going to open
up<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.360> light<00:02:49.600> design<00:02:50.020> studio<00:02:50.530> thing<00:02:50.880> right

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
up this light design studio thing right

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.560 
up this light design studio thing right
so<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.240> can<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.340> sorts<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:55.120> things<00:02:55.270> right

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
so you can do all sorts of things right

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.230 
so you can do all sorts of things right
this<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.230> just<00:02:56.470> an<00:02:56.650> object<00:02:56.890> template<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.380> then

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
this is just an object template and then

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.380 
this is just an object template and then
you<00:03:01.240> can<00:03:01.420> add<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.990> blocks<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.830> stuff<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:07.330> a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
you can add like blocks and stuff it's a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.810 
you can add like blocks and stuff it's a
bit<00:03:07.570> difficult<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.290> build<00:03:08.890> with<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.550> thing

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
bit difficult to build with this thing

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:17.300 
bit difficult to build with this thing
right

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430 

so<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.239> whatever<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.930> want<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> then

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
so you can do whatever you want and then

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
so you can do whatever you want and then
you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.770> save<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.760> put<00:03:20.940> it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
you can save it and then you can put it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.690 
you can save it and then you can put it
on<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.300> map<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.720> whatever<00:03:25.220> that's<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.520> one

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
on your map or whatever that's just one

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.729 
on your map or whatever that's just one
of<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.849> little<00:03:26.910> bugs<00:03:27.360> there<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.380> refreshes

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
of the little bugs there it refreshes

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.370 
of the little bugs there it refreshes
every<00:03:29.160> time<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.580> click<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> play<00:03:30.180> button<00:03:30.380> I'm

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
every time you click the play button I'm

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.170 
every time you click the play button I'm
not<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> big<00:03:31.890> fan<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.610> here<00:03:33.030> we're

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
not a big fan of that and here we're

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.850 
not a big fan of that and here we're
back<00:03:33.330> at<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.510> loading<00:03:33.810> screen<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.440> takes

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
back at the loading screen it takes

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.729 
back at the loading screen it takes
quite<00:03:35.190> some<00:03:35.459> time<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.970> load<00:03:36.209> which<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.319> sort<00:03:37.650> of

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
quite some time to load which is sort of

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:46.729 
quite some time to load which is sort of
disappointing<00:03:44.120> right<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.349> open<00:03:46.650> up

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
disappointing right so you can open up

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.220 
disappointing right so you can open up
the<00:03:46.800> map<00:03:47.130> here<00:03:47.640> then<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.569> go<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.930> these

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the map here then you can go to these

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.150 
the map here then you can go to these
levels<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.010> stuff<00:03:50.100> they<00:03:50.880> each<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.480> icons

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
levels and stuff they each have icons

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.699 
levels and stuff they each have icons
I'm<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.340> sure<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.700> they<00:03:53.850> mean<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.709> they

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
I'm not sure what they mean but they

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.590 
I'm not sure what they mean but they
seem<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.010> correspond<00:03:56.790> with<00:03:56.940> what's<00:03:57.330> in<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
seem to correspond with what's in the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.039 
seem to correspond with what's in the
cave<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:58.170> some<00:03:58.470> degree<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.989> on

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
cave to some degree right so you go on

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.370 
cave to some degree right so you go on
your<00:04:01.170> cape<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:02.730> need<00:04:02.910> specific<00:04:03.720> items<00:04:04.170> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
your cape you need specific items and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.100 
your cape you need specific items and
stuff<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:05.610> get<00:04:05.730> them<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.120> make<00:04:06.269> buildings<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
stuff to get them you make buildings and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.740 
stuff to get them you make buildings and
so<00:04:07.319> on<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.849> pretty<00:04:09.060> good<00:04:09.330> thing<00:04:09.599> you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
so on so that's a pretty good thing you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.440 
so on so that's a pretty good thing you
don't<00:04:09.870> need<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.130> special<00:04:11.819> currency<00:04:12.330> or

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
don't need like the special currency or

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.879 
don't need like the special currency or
whatever<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.560> actually<00:04:13.920> play<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.250> game<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.380 

right<00:04:19.889> I'm<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.609> show<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.090> guys

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
right I'm just going to show you guys

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.790 
right I'm just going to show you guys
end<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.560> level<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.100> guess<00:04:24.470> there<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.770> a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
end of this level I guess there is a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.330 
end of this level I guess there is a
score<00:04:26.580> system<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:28.080> believe<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.919> score<00:04:29.160> is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
score system and I believe the score is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.610 
score system and I believe the score is
based<00:04:29.520> on<00:04:29.789> pretty<00:04:30.090> much<00:04:30.270> how<00:04:30.840> many<00:04:31.140> moves

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
based on pretty much how many moves

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.860 
based on pretty much how many moves
you'd<00:04:32.010> make<00:04:32.280> or<00:04:32.610> something<00:04:33.000> I'm<00:04:33.180> not<00:04:33.300> too<00:04:33.630> sure

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
you'd make or something I'm not too sure

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.070 
you'd make or something I'm not too sure
about<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:39.240> can<00:04:39.419> get<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.780> better

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
about that and you can get like better

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.590 
about that and you can get like better
shovels<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.860> stuff<00:04:41.100> oh<00:04:41.310> crap<00:04:41.940> i<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.150> got<00:04:42.419> hit

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
shovels and stuff oh crap i just got hit

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.659 
shovels and stuff oh crap i just got hit
by<00:04:42.780> boulder<00:04:43.260> oh<00:04:43.590> how<00:04:43.950> did<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.220> not<00:04:44.370> see<00:04:44.430> that

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
by boulder oh how did I not see that

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:53.350 
by boulder oh how did I not see that
coming<00:04:50.000> blue<00:04:51.000> gem<00:04:51.479> stuff<00:04:51.900> or<00:04:52.139> whatever<00:04:52.289> I<00:04:52.500> got

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
coming blue gem stuff or whatever I got

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.570 
coming blue gem stuff or whatever I got
so<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.720> think<00:04:54.960> that's<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.200> bee<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.800> that's<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.070> B+

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
so I think that's a bee so that's a B+

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.680 
so I think that's a bee so that's a B+
right<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.600> get<00:04:57.720> readings<00:04:58.139> at<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.380> end<00:04:58.560> of

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
right you get readings at the end of

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.890 
right you get readings at the end of
whatever<00:05:00.690> right<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> map<00:05:03.360> go<00:05:03.840> to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
whatever right so to the map go to

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.969 
whatever right so to the map go to
another<00:05:04.080> one

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.300 

all<00:05:07.979> right<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:09.030> it's<00:05:09.419> pretty<00:05:09.810> smooth<00:05:10.320> right

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
all right I'm it's pretty smooth right

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:23.420 
all right I'm it's pretty smooth right
so<00:05:21.229> I'm<00:05:22.229> probably<00:05:22.710> going<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.070> run<00:05:23.220> out<00:05:23.250> of

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
so I'm probably going to run out of

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.390 
so I'm probably going to run out of
energy<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:24.600> this<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.919> thing<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.370> I

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
energy so this is just the thing that I

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.460 
energy so this is just the thing that I
don't<00:05:26.639> like<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.180> energy<00:05:27.900> you're<00:05:28.199> going<00:05:28.380> to

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
don't like is the energy you're going to

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.320 
don't like is the energy you're going to
run<00:05:28.680> out<00:05:28.789> so<00:05:29.789> often<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.750> fast<00:05:31.110> right<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.370> then

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
run out so often so fast right and then

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.090 
run out so often so fast right and then
you<00:05:33.419> got<00:05:33.539> to<00:05:33.630> wait<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:34.080> five<00:05:34.410> minutes<00:05:34.740> 41

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
you got to wait like five minutes 41

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.870 
you got to wait like five minutes 41
points<00:05:36.380> but<00:05:37.380> it's<00:05:37.740> when<00:05:37.949> I<00:05:37.979> guess<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.550> going<00:05:38.729> to

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
points but it's when I guess is going to

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.420 
points but it's when I guess is going to
keep<00:05:39.210> people<00:05:39.449> hooked<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.530> game<00:05:40.740> right

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
keep people hooked on to the game right

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.800 
keep people hooked on to the game right
because<00:05:41.699> they<00:05:41.820> have<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.030> log<00:05:42.270> in<00:05:42.479> more<00:05:42.660> often

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
because they have to log in more often

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.800 
because they have to log in more often
sort<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.770> like<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:43.949> farm<00:05:44.910> bill<00:05:45.240> or<00:05:45.479> something

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
sort of like a farm bill or something

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.089 
sort of like a farm bill or something
like<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:45.990> but<00:05:46.320> I'm<00:05:46.440> not<00:05:46.590> really<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.889> big<00:05:47.039> fan

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
like that but I'm not really a big fan

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:53.629 
like that but I'm not really a big fan
of<00:05:47.400> those<00:05:47.699> games<00:05:50.030> right<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:52.530> prices<00:05:53.099> for<00:05:53.130> the

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
of those games right the prices for the

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.490 
of those games right the prices for the
items<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.300> haven't<00:05:54.509> taken<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.169> look<00:05:55.259> at<00:05:55.380> the

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
items I haven't taken a look at the

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.350 
items I haven't taken a look at the
pricing<00:05:55.889> let's<00:05:56.039> take<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.280> look<00:05:56.490> at<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.849> pricing

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
pricing let's take a look at the pricing

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.430 
pricing let's take a look at the pricing
here<00:05:58.280> so<00:05:59.280> eight<00:05:59.669> is<00:06:00.349> two<00:06:01.349> dollars<00:06:01.800> right<00:06:02.430> so

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
here so eight is two dollars right so

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.490 
here so eight is two dollars right so
it's<00:06:04.440> pretty<00:06:04.830> expensive<00:06:05.250> in<00:06:05.699> my<00:06:05.849> opinion

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
it's pretty expensive in my opinion

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.400 
it's pretty expensive in my opinion
fifty<00:06:07.500> dollars<00:06:07.530> only<00:06:08.039> gets<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.460> like<00:06:09.410> 262

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
fifty dollars only gets you like 262

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.510 
fifty dollars only gets you like 262
crowns<00:06:11.010> or<00:06:11.250> whatever<00:06:12.229> I'd<00:06:13.229> expect<00:06:13.830> something

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
crowns or whatever I'd expect something

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.870 
crowns or whatever I'd expect something
like<00:06:14.699> at<00:06:15.090> least<00:06:15.300> 500<00:06:16.110> or<00:06:16.260> 5,000<00:06:17.130> in<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.669> case

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
like at least 500 or 5,000 in the case

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.719 
like at least 500 or 5,000 in the case
of<00:06:17.909> this<00:06:18.240> game<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.889> present<00:06:20.310> is<00:06:20.430> a<00:06:20.460> little

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
of this game so the present is a little

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.899 
of this game so the present is a little
bit<00:06:20.880> I<00:06:21.060> but<00:06:22.020> hopefully<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.860> lower<00:06:23.099> it<00:06:23.340> down<00:06:23.370> in

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
bit I but hopefully the lower it down in

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:30.230 
bit I but hopefully the lower it down in
the<00:06:24.060> future<00:06:26.690> but<00:06:27.690> overall<00:06:28.349> it<00:06:28.830> so<00:06:29.130> it's<00:06:29.280> a<00:06:29.520> you

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
the future but overall it so it's a you

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.189 
the future but overall it so it's a you
know<00:06:30.360> it's<00:06:30.510> a<00:06:30.570> unique<00:06:30.870> game<00:06:31.199> its<00:06:31.560> original<00:06:32.250> and

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
know it's a unique game its original and

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.540 
know it's a unique game its original and
I<00:06:34.199> think<00:06:34.889> it'll<00:06:35.310> do<00:06:35.490> fairly<00:06:35.789> well<00:06:35.940> I<00:06:37.550> don't

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
I think it'll do fairly well I don't

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.540 
I think it'll do fairly well I don't
think<00:06:38.759> though<00:06:38.880> it'll<00:06:39.150> be<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.389> complete<00:06:39.570> failure

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
think though it'll be a complete failure

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.120 
think though it'll be a complete failure
but<00:06:41.780> like<00:06:42.780> I<00:06:42.930> said<00:06:42.990> they<00:06:43.440> need<00:06:43.620> to<00:06:43.710> do<00:06:43.889> more

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
but like I said they need to do more

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:51.020 
but like I said they need to do more
advertising<00:06:47.840> because<00:06:48.840> they<00:06:49.909> you<00:06:50.909> know<00:06:50.940> they

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
advertising because they you know they

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.820 
advertising because they you know they
don't<00:06:51.210> have<00:06:51.449> many<00:06:51.720> players<00:06:52.050> and<00:06:52.470> as<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.710> can

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
don't have many players and as you can

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.070 
don't have many players and as you can
see<00:06:52.860> none<00:06:53.759> of<00:06:53.909> my<00:06:54.060> friends<00:06:54.270> are<00:06:54.509> already<00:06:54.659> on<00:06:54.930> it

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
because I'm like the first one but then

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.810 
because I'm like the first one but then
again<00:06:56.820> the<00:06:57.120> game<00:06:57.300> just<00:06:57.509> came<00:06:57.780> out<00:06:58.190> anyway<00:06:59.190> this
