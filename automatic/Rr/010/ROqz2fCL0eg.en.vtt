00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.809
 Hello, I want to show you how 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.829
 knot knot in not 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:16.360
 this knot is usually tied 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:20.090
 swivel bait knot 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.720
 multifunctional therefore got its 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:30.860
 name not abbreviated 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:33.199
 universal and so skip for 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.469
 greater strength we will miss the second 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.469
 time 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.089
 further here missed 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:52.229
 twine twice we add here is our 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:59.939
 the tip is forming a loop like this 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:01:01.489
 would be the end and where we skip here 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:07.159
 this is our 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.159
 loop well, you can 5 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.770
 you can still eat 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.770
 no big deal 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:37.760
 we pull up turns out so 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:47.479
 self locking loop the whole thing with 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:49.910
 urinary naturally here we got 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.450
 such a node is unnecessary now 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.450
 cut off 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.459
 here is such a node called y 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.970
 not 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:15.599
 knot is very simple knitting 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.420
 nothing complicated no thank you all 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.800
