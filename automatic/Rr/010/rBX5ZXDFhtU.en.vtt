 hyip only scandals to crush critics 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.360
 and miles teller publicly called all 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 asshole for starring in this movie 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.020
 director joshua trunk which is in the very 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.879
 twitter almost renounced movies 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 with all the blame on the studio they say they did 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.710
 shit yes yes yes fill us with a trang I am 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.100
 by really feel so bad 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.930
 yes bad many people compare this film with 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 batman and robin on their stinky wall 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 dare I say it is even worse 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.050
 eared why are you because batman and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.969
 Robin thought a priori moronly 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.530
 it was supposed to shine brightly 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 whistle and fart you are plus on the same 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 Schwarz could have fun 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.549
 Fours is that there is nothing there version 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 joshua trunk and you won't find normal 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.720
 plot of the whole script charismatic 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 heroes of good action and at least humor 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.100
 these are just services swarm side by side tell me 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 I'm a fantastic four a priori 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 character slightly comical at the same time 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.560
 cohesive little funny 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.479
 they seem to be created for the marvel universe 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 20th century Fox or had every chance to do 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 your analogue of styles let's say 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 thank you joshua trunk who wanted 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.939
 movie dark and stern face about what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 what is happening looks even more delusional 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 and believe the torch man does not say a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 far from the main problem of the film rather 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.259
 on the contrary michael jordan is the only one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.829
 caste who even tries to shine 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.600
 charisma 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.369
 it is charisma because to play it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.750
 Essentially, he and his colleagues, they are nothing. 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.700
 just for an hour and a half 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.470
 leave frames serious mug roll out 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 on the loaf of cliché phrases and dialogues 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.579
 miles teller you crap and what 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 show could not give up and especially kate 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.689
 mara sang party sue you want 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 believe you want no we depend this special world 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 I have never changed my emotions 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.990
 a little in my opinion her facial muscles in general 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.750
 atrophied where let the charisma hero not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.220
 grabs nose 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.920
 but the shit is that the movie 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.840
 hell boring he doesn't even try us 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 entertain no plot moves 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.500
 cliché drawn by ears and on 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.840
 most part introduces fucking bewilderment 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 and you picked up punks from the street to those 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.530
 quietly flew into space and along the way 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 just created ahab in quotes villain 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.959
 by the way doctor motivation thought 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.510
 amazing it is not like moaning fireplaces 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.670
 he is a bad film because it is just like that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.140
 need to be cunning I will not like 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.270
 his image is a visual component 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.890
 Dr. Doom looks eerily and even 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.870
 at some point you believe that heroes 2 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.730
 so you will defeat him however this moment 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.650
 godless short in time screen 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.270
 I think only five minutes heroes 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.070
 become heroes only closer to the chat 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.440
 adata timing you will have to wait 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.120
 only pathetic stencil bla bla bla bla 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.800
 if you want to see becoming 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.900
 characters of their personal motivation by 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.790
 bring a member of his homeless in the stairwell and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.980
 it's all literally tweeted 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.900
 bang we all became super strong and then 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.850
 a year has passed and now the hero is already arch 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.709
 cool action by the way further military 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.209
 base is not going anywhere near a 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.340
 the feeling that the creators were just lazy 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.470
 from the pavilion to go out and filmed it all 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.570
 in the same type of IT services scenery and why 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.150
 we get a sense of stiffness chemistry 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.930
 between the characters there is no they in the frame just 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.489
 exist 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.709
 I do not feel any command 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.360
 cohesion of friendship is felt only 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.650
 some bite of irritated ash 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 who was everywhere on the set 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.700
 playground and dogs don soul to rank 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.200
 probably you were disappointed by the audience 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.930
 think maybe action at least 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 enjoy x ha ha general complexity of it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.489
 there for 5 minutes to make a bunch more dreary 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.140
 it is just impossible god even when not 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.120
 fight doctor doom they manage 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.280
 parallel scratching language and and plus they 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.250
 attack him one by one 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.810
 bag as for this is stupid if action us 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.220
 decided to separate it 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.220
 the visual part will be good 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.840
 No, they managed to ruin even this 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.440
 I do not believe that the hero stand on another 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 the planet 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.730
 Well, I do not believe that the monkey for trial 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.040
 flight tests are real all some 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.690
 artificial hackneyed greasy this 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.220
 the film doesn't surprise you at all 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.900
 old kinoshka tried us at least 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.640
 entertain this one with your pathos only 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.370
 dug your grave you that we actually 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.930
 form of lack of humor plot motivation 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.670
 charismatic characters of good 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.160
 mounting tightly directed by normal 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.280
 action villains shorter in four 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.200
 there is absolutely nothing that should 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.150
 good blockbusters on marvel comics 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.100
 and the output is the perfect formula for 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.320
 failure on the first now you start on me 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.940
 yell they say clearly tel pirates down 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.580
 yourself great criticism may slight 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.200
 screen looks different slid down 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.060
 here I am now on the other side where 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.210
 Thursday is already going to the cinema I will tell you 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.040
 no big screen position will save and 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.990
 leave him 3 out of 10 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.820
 the economy is better than their hard-earned 200 rubles 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.690
 on agents angel but whether at all spending 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.610
