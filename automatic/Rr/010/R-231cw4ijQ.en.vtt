added<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:11.670> insulation<00:00:12.240> around<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.540> edges<00:00:12.870> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900

added the insulation around the edges of
the<00:00:13.049> door<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:14.250> I've<00:00:14.549> also<00:00:14.730> used<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.109> high

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the door and I've also used the high

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.650 
the door and I've also used the high
temperature<00:00:16.529> silicone<00:00:17.300> around<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> top

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
temperature silicone around the top

where<00:00:19.020> smoke<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.500> leaking<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.920> first

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
where smoke was leaking out the first

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.790 
where smoke was leaking out the first
time<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.460> used<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.439> say<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
time I used it I can all I can say is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.109 
time I used it I can all I can say is
it's<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.220> night<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.430> day<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.760> terms<00:00:23.880> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it's like night and day in terms of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
it's like night and day in terms of
experience<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.960> first<00:00:25.199> time<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> used<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
experience the first time I used it I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
experience the first time I used it I
had<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> very<00:00:26.310> hard<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:26.550> maintaining<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.330> high

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
had a very hard time maintaining a high

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
had a very hard time maintaining a high
temperature<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.769> kept<00:00:28.980> falling<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
temperature it kept falling and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
temperature it kept falling and
obviously<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.449> losing<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.050> smoke

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
obviously I was losing a lot of smoke

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
obviously I was losing a lot of smoke
the<00:00:31.619> flavor<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:31.980> fine<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> took<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.180> long

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the flavor was fine but it took a long

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
the flavor was fine but it took a long
time<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.899> cook<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.070> really

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
time to cook so I was really

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
time to cook so I was really
disappointed<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> performance<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
disappointed in the performance the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
disappointed in the performance the
first<00:00:37.500> time<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.460> time<00:00:38.670> I've<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> nice

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
first time this time I've got a nice

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
first time this time I've got a nice
chuck<00:00:39.480> steak<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.309> cruising

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
chuck steak in there and it is cruising

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.280 
chuck steak in there and it is cruising
along<00:00:41.879> I've<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> hard<00:00:42.600> time<00:00:42.690> keeping<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
along I've had a hard time keeping the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500 
along I've had a hard time keeping the
temperature<00:00:43.770> down<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.059> wanted<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
temperature down it actually wanted to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
temperature down it actually wanted to
creep<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:45.989> 300<00:00:46.350> degrees<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.190> first

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
creep up over 300 degrees when I first

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
creep up over 300 degrees when I first
threw<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> coals<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> obviously<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
threw the coals in there and obviously I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.830 
threw the coals in there and obviously I
wanted<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.039> around<00:00:50.280> 225<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wanted it more down around 225 so I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
wanted it more down around 225 so I
really<00:00:52.110> choked<00:00:52.350> off<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> fire<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> top

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really choked off the fire with the top

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.760 
really choked off the fire with the top
and<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> bottom<00:00:54.510> vents<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.559> doing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
little 45-degree cuts out of the edges
of<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.549> halfway<00:01:44.820> through<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
of this about halfway through so that I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.969 
of this about halfway through so that I
could<00:01:45.990> bend<00:01:46.200> around<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> corners<00:01:46.829> because

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
could bend around the corners because

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
could bend around the corners because
you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:48.030> nice<00:01:48.149> curved<00:01:48.479> corners

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you can see there's nice curved corners

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.800 
you can see there's nice curved corners
here<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> did<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.240> ran<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
here so I did that and then I ran a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.289 
here so I did that and then I ran a
small<00:01:52.290> bead<00:01:52.530> around<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.430> top<00:01:53.670> edge<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
small bead around the top edge if you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
small bead around the top edge if you
watch<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.780> early<00:01:55.049> videos<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> could

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
watch one of my early videos you could

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620 
watch one of my early videos you could
see<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.979> water<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:56.939> leaking<00:01:57.390> help

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
see that water was actually leaking help

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
see that water was actually leaking help
that<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> side<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.509> should

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that the side over here you should

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
that the side over here you should
actually<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.049> able<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> little<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.740> of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
actually be able to see a little bit of

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.969 
actually be able to see a little bit of
a<00:02:01.920> damage<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.110> damaged<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a damage over here it's not damaged the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
a damage over here it's not damaged the
leakage<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> streak<00:02:06.390> marks

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
leakage you can see the streak marks

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.969 
leakage you can see the streak marks
over<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:06.869> where<00:02:07.110> water<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.530> running<00:02:07.829> down

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
over here where water was running down

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
over here where water was running down
no<00:02:08.700> water<00:02:08.940> nothing<00:02:09.300> leaking<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.840> sides

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
no water nothing leaking out the sides

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.930 
no water nothing leaking out the sides
you

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.370 
you
easily<00:02:11.210> see<00:02:11.390> smoke<00:02:11.660> especially<00:02:11.900> along<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
easily see smoke especially along the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
top of the door and over here in this

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.480 
top of the door and over here in this
spot<00:02:14.870> none<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.590> that's<00:02:15.650> leaking<00:02:16.040> out<00:02:16.160> now<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
spot none of that's leaking out now and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.590 
spot none of that's leaking out now and
I'm<00:02:16.550> getting<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> good<00:02:16.910> smoke<00:02:17.150> coming<00:02:17.480> out<00:02:17.540> of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
I'm getting a good smoke coming out of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.360 
I'm getting a good smoke coming out of
the<00:02:17.720> top

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the top

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.500 
the top
anyway<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.490> mods<00:02:19.670> worked<00:02:19.940> great<00:02:20.180> I'm<00:02:20.330> really

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
anyway the mods worked great I'm really

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.820 
anyway the mods worked great I'm really
happy<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.960> smoker<00:02:21.260> now<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.710> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
happy with the smoker now that I have it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.710 
happy with the smoker now that I have it
modded<00:02:22.190> probably<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:22.970> only<00:02:23.150> disappointing

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
modded probably the only disappointing

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.110 
modded probably the only disappointing
thing<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.290> had<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:25.820> about<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
thing that's I had I have about the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.910 
thing that's I had I have about the
smoker<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.720> thing<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.990> would<00:02:27.050> say<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.410> try

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
smoker and the thing I would say is try

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.680 
smoker and the thing I would say is try
to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.250> mods<00:02:28.460> before<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.970> cure<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.240> it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
to do the mods before you cure it it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
to do the mods before you cure it it
makes<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.080> little<00:02:30.230> hard<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.560> stick<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
makes it a little hard to stick the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.740 
makes it a little hard to stick the
insulation<00:02:32.600> around<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.900> door<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:34.130> course

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
insulation around the door and of course

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.210 
insulation around the door and of course
you<00:02:35.750> know<00:02:35.840> because<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.560> harder<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.010> maintain

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
you know because it's harder to maintain

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.980 
you know because it's harder to maintain
a<00:02:37.460> temperature<00:02:37.610> without<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.240> being<00:02:38.420> modded<00:02:38.810> I

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
a temperature without it being modded I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.720 
a temperature without it being modded I
wasn't<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.620> comfortable<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> oil

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
wasn't really comfortable that the oil

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.460 
wasn't really comfortable that the oil
got<00:02:40.910> about<00:02:41.120> 400<00:02:41.570> degrees<00:02:41.630> for<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.080> long<00:02:42.230> enough

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
got about 400 degrees for a long enough

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.350 
got about 400 degrees for a long enough
time<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.740> really<00:02:43.160> set<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.610> oil<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.030> bake<00:02:44.210> it

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
time to really set the oil and bake it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.510 
time to really set the oil and bake it
on<00:02:44.480> give<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> nice<00:02:45.350> nonstick<00:02:45.650> surface<00:02:46.340> so

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
on give it the nice nonstick surface so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.100 
on give it the nice nonstick surface so
I'm<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.180> little<00:02:47.450> worried<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.780> might<00:02:47.960> hand

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
I'm a little worried that I might hand

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.630 
I'm a little worried that I might hand
out<00:02:48.230> damaging<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> smoker<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> little<00:02:49.520> bit
