 So called certain pollutants of which is known that they, for example 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.720

 especially with the criterion of safety, the chaff separated from the wheat 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 so the CYBEX Pallas to fix because of crash scored low in times forces 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580
 even very low load values 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580

 so that would be enough that the load values ​​comparatively low 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 are 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.540

 the cashflow prefix coup he 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.299
 he gets the overall mark deficient because of its high load values ​​in 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.609
 Front beheaded 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.989
 that's the problem with this child
