this<00:02:13.400> character<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> commenter<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
this character or the commenter is

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.420 
this character or the commenter is
saying<00:02:17.629> on<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:19.230> top<00:02:19.440> left<00:02:19.709> corner<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.220> see

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
saying on the top left corner we see

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.089 
saying on the top left corner we see
some<00:02:20.670> new<00:02:21.030> ATM<00:02:21.599> counter<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.709> think<00:02:22.769> this

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
some new ATM counter so I think this

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.430 
some new ATM counter so I think this
means<00:02:23.280> something<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.810> actions<00:02:24.810> per<00:02:25.049> minute

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
means something like actions per minute

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.400 
means something like actions per minute
so<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.340> many<00:02:26.610> times<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.269> check<00:02:27.569> or<00:02:27.840> wipe<00:02:28.140> the
