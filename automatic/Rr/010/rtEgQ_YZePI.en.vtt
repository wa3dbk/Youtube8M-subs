00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:13.509
 that is why you were very different. which I show you how you can forbid others 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.859
 products that I didn't like three quarters are the mineral corrector of 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.539
 general-purpose line times remixed 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.240
 poor little hello village 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.649
 elena corrector fluid of the wooden rimmel and lift I feel in Naples 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.199
 so why did I not like these products? 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.290
 waste mineral makeup products will surely know 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.380
 that I didn't like the correctors because at least I'm not God 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.469
 worked 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.679
 that is, the colors are in my opinion too marked, therefore yellow 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.200
 turns out to be too yellow and the guy turns out to be too much song 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.450
 for which also applied in small quantities e-pens and smoking in any case to the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.310
 end was very noticeable 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.850
 this color variant and at least resign. to you I have to study the effect 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.220
 I didn't like it at all and it just doesn't seem to work 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 then explore marano to reduce dark circles 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 I didn't like the English grammar checker because 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.070
 although the chosen tonality was enough we say close to what it is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.680
 ilaria 3 ita for the driving license seemed to me a bit to be a little bit too much 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.690
 transparent and then cover cook 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.180
 what he simply did I created by myself two correctional worlds 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.580
 and the foods inside an empty garden - sediment is 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.650
 very simple indeed they have done nothing but make it into the fluid then 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.719
 creamy 1 mineral concealer 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.259
 the difference what if you saw my president's foundation tutorial 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.789
 mineral that becomes a fluid foundation 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.829
 you will remember that I had risked mineral foundation with moisturizer 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.380
 it was the one that habitually uses for the face to do this same procedure 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.189
 the concealer with me 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.229
 the corirere 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.099
 it didn't make much sense because they will connect over all the colors that 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.600
 they caused me trouble 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.070
 mixing it with the cream like that around the eyes would have made no sense 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.879
 because the color would have remained too yellow anyway I have too much song 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.040
 so what did I do as a psychiatrist 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 koan the corrector precisely this here that had a creation that was let's say 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 right for my skin 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.930
 but it seemed to me to be too transparent 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.840
 so what I did business was really simple that you don't even know 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.990
 here to show me poses of evenings squeezed a bit of the years of 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.340
 concealer on the bottom beautiful jiaretta after which with a spatula I started 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 to shake the concealer this here is a result with the concealer with the use 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.310
 of the yellow concealer after which I did the exact same procedure 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.439
 with the track corrector 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.840
 song that for effects a ronzone 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.929
 a similar corrector is contained tending to the next 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:10.409
 queen indeed. those that seemed to me to be too yellow now embed 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.030
 tending to yellow 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.959
 elba beautiful for dark circles especially those purple face instead 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.390
 this song here is fine d + earth 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.330
 those of vivastre therefore it is necessary to distinguish actually 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.180
 now works 8 found 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.760
 an effect checker you are spying on these products 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.129
 I kept a correct name is perfect 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.359
 the postman that I can give you which 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.930
 is to put first 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.189
 at the bottom of 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.370
 all fluid corrector to add after a little bit the 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.919
 checker in you can afford because if you put the dust first and then there 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.940
 squeeze 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.239

 elos so press inside the air that will come out in the tube to make it fly 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.180
 away all the mineral dust and therefore there is a waste and it is done in short 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.490
 dirt around the z 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.450
 then omg text simply ulna 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.860
 at the bottom of a concealer, then with the spatula with the removed one 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.379
 I am afraid therefore added minerals 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:22.279
 that to the concealer in the storm and with a wooden stick the one for the 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.040
 manufacturing 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.310
 I turned gerardo street until I got the consistency of the timmy color 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.439

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.300

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:48.529
