00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.300 
usually right here it's got it right
here<00:00:26.750> you'll<00:00:27.750> find<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.140> tool<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.160> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's blowing or cause you blew it on the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's blowing or cause you blew it on the
side<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> trail<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.489> something<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
side of the trail or something so you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
side of the trail or something so you
just<00:00:37.460> whine<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:42.059> when

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
just whine this in here and then when

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
just whine this in here and then when
you<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> you'll<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> wind<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you do it you'll see that when I wind it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.319 
you do it you'll see that when I wind it
spreads<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:48.770> cluster<00:00:49.770> apart<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> makes

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
spreads the cluster apart so it makes

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.290 
spreads the cluster apart so it makes
easier<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.050> belt<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.520> usually

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
easier to get your belt out so I usually

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
easier to get your belt out so I usually
wind<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.870> pretty<00:00:55.199> much<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.340> every

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.650 
wind it in pretty much all the way every
time<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:58.760> then<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.530> once<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.660> I'll

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
time and then all once I have it in I'll

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
time and then all once I have it in I'll

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I usually just start off here gotten put

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.470 
I usually just start off here gotten put
it<00:02:14.010> around<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.280> top<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:17.210> try<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.360> get

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
then once it's on I usually just undo

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:36.080 
then once it's on I usually just undo
