note that i'm going to say for this for
this<00:00:52.440> side<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> bad<00:00:53.430> side<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you've got the defense side twice so you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
your score after this round I think I go

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
your score after this round I think I go
like<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> four<00:01:01.859> kdr<00:01:02.100> after<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.579> round<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
like a four kdr after this round but I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
like a four kdr after this round but I
ended<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.660> coming<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.260> game<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.589> 120

ended up coming up this game with 120
kills<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.729> 16<00:01:06.630> deaths<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.170> something

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
kills and 16 deaths I think something

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
kills and 16 deaths I think something
like<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.610> double<00:01:08.909> Moab's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like that and also get double Moab's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.460 
like that and also get double Moab's
throughout<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.630> game<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.229> much

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
