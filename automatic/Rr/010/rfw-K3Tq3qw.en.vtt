00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.470 
watch this with low expectations which I
did<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.000> can<00:04:50.480> be<00:04:50.660> somewhat<00:04:51.440> enjoyable<00:04:52.480> but

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
did it can be somewhat enjoyable but

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.270 
did it can be somewhat enjoyable but
still<00:04:54.470> kind<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:55.060> disappointing<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.800> I<00:05:00.280> just

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
still kind of disappointing so I just

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.409 
still kind of disappointing so I just
think<00:05:01.550> it's<00:05:01.730> a<00:05:01.940> lame<00:05:03.130> k<00:05:04.130> it's<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.730> kiddie<00:05:05.060> show

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
think it's a lame k it's a kiddie show

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.950 
think it's a lame k it's a kiddie show
it's<00:05:05.660> not<00:05:05.870> even<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.260> superhero<00:05:06.890> show<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:08.030> what

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
it's not even a superhero show so what

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.810 
it's not even a superhero show so what
what<00:05:09.320> superhero<00:05:09.860> still<00:05:10.100> doesn't<00:05:10.340> have<00:05:10.400> super

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
what superhero still doesn't have super

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.800 
what superhero still doesn't have super

season<00:05:38.990> 1<00:05:39.260> episode<00:05:39.919> 1<00:05:40.780> review<00:05:41.780> but<00:05:42.620> I'm<00:05:43.070> just

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
season 1 episode 1 review but I'm just

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.570 
season 1 episode 1 review but I'm just
making<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.930> episode<00:05:45.440> 1<00:05:45.620> because<00:05:45.979> I<00:05:46.220> don't

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
making it episode 1 because I don't

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.670 
making it episode 1 because I don't
think<00:05:46.790> they're<00:05:46.940> gonna<00:05:47.030> even<00:05:47.450> make<00:05:47.479> it<00:05:47.870> for<00:05:48.650> a

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
think they're gonna even make it for a

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.320 
think they're gonna even make it for a
full<00:05:48.979> first<00:05:49.280> season<00:05:49.700> I<00:05:49.729> think<00:05:49.970> it's<00:05:50.120> going<00:05:50.270> to

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
full first season I think it's going to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.620 
full first season I think it's going to
be<00:05:50.419> get<00:05:50.780> cancelled<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.450> hopefully<00:05:53.450> they'll

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
be get cancelled and hopefully they'll

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.080 
be get cancelled and hopefully they'll
bring<00:05:53.810> young<00:05:54.020> justice<00:05:54.470> back<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:55.400> like<00:05:55.669> it's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
bring young justice back it's like it's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.030 
bring young justice back it's like it's
like<00:05:56.210> people<00:05:56.660> Cartoon<00:05:57.110> Network<00:05:57.410> don't<00:05:57.800> even

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
like people Cartoon Network don't even

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.920 
like people Cartoon Network don't even
care<00:05:58.520> what<00:05:58.820> we<00:05:58.940> have<00:05:58.970> to<00:05:59.090> say<00:05:59.419> because
