00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.700
 I think for a festive appetizer 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.529
 salmon is best 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660
 I'll show you how we do it today 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.550
 one to make one at earlier became that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 All used around the salmon 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.800
 dug in with salt sugar 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 ground, the salmon held several weeks for 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470
 we need sugar salt on our side 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 that in the main elements and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 various spices and tasteless give 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.170
 I have juniper allspice and for that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.170
 clove mustard seed orange peel and 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.710
 before we have to brison our salmon 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.630
 We will prepare this first 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 the thin tapered tail piece 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.000
 dashing off as well as the belly 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 to let 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.180
 also the tapered head piece becomes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 just cut off 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 you do not have to shed salmon 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 Put the salmon directly on the skin 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 irritate and he with the bottom on the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.369
 Sheet metal is that we start with 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.159
 For the wheat, we put the dax on 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.990
 finally a key 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.470
 now i have prepared sugar and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.009
 salt for our other three parts 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.910
 sugar and two parts 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.920
 salt in the case 90 grams of sugar and 60 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:44.310
 gram salt used at about one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 kilo salmon our spices allspice 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.690
 juniper and clove I just press 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 only with the knife back properly 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.909
 so that the flavors come out already 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 she called our mixture so we will 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.960
 are tired of it 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:16.110
 orange peel make sure that he 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.670
 really just rub off the peel and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.930
 not the white of the orange 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.930
 that makes the whole please 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.960
 and finally finely chopped 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.600
 the whole mission is good with each other 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.360
 a little knead with it, too 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.780
 salt and sugar the taste spices 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780
 accept 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.319
 We will now pack this mixture 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.319
 our dax 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.850
 Now the salmon with fresh foil 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.900
 Cover and put in for 12 to 24 hours 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.160
 the cooling for our vinaigrette 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.160
 we need 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.090
 the maple syrup 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:04:03.349
 the vinegar oil vigorously with each other 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 devious and a good handful 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:15.169
 fresh with salt and pepper 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:20.040
 season it and then whisk it 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.120
 vigorously pound dressing or little 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.979
 Money can always be a bit stronger 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.900
 can be if he tastes it tastes 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.250
 She with a salad leaves has one 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.380
 pretty high proportion of water and 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.810
 dilute few wonderful 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.910
 that we can do a lex and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.220
 I brought salmon from the cooling 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.180
 roughly liberated from the spices 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.510
 and washed off 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.530
 Now it's time to peel off the skin 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.510
 we can briefly kreuth and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.590
 turn and then it works and finds 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.590
 We can slices under fast 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:58.310
 hold the skin tight and now on 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.860
 the skin along and somehow not 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.860
 print the salmon like the animals 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:12.560
 and the salmon with the top 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.560
 once in chopped herbs look 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.919
 in this case the chopped dill 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.310
 I just spread the rest 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.310
 about it 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.490
 press and now no one in 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.490
 traunstein 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.660
 slices of salmon you can then easily 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.660
 drape your salad on 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:52.870
 slice something on its own 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.490
 the few dax and salad go the 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.170
 spicy fish and the fruity sweetness 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.300
 Sauce is a great way to get started 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.340

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.490
