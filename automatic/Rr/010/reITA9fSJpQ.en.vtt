 hello you are in the garden 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280
 natural farming grandmother Lyudmila 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
 I want to tell you about watermelons today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.080
 and melons which I grow on bahcha 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.940
 on the ground not in the greenhouse for three years 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.769
 previously it is grown in the greenhouse but was at 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.099
 I have very few of them and that experience has already come 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 growing watermelons like this on earth 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.980
 it looks like my melon with watermelons I want 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 tell you about agricultural engineering 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.520
 watermelon growing 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.870
 my gardening is in the second 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 Belt who understands this very where is cold 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.510
 we have very cold nights and here I am 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:55.010
 starting to grow seedlings about 1 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.629
 being guided two days the general first 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.949
 soot 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.270
 big-big cups seeds on 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 watermelon and melon seedlings 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 then I start cooking the beds of the garden 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.280
 I do 70 centimeters and 20 centimeters 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 the path of the beds is low then I 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 the beds are covered in transparent foil 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 the film is white in one layer i cut this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 film and blanketed these plump 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 beds 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.720
 and I’m mulching the path that I have 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.659
 grass straw old sawdust husks from 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.759
 This year's seeds have used this 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.470
 everything is pressed there and then I make cuts 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:50.579
 after 80 centimeters and approximately June 10 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 I plant watermelons seedlings watermelons in 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.850
 open ground I will grow watermelons only 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.520

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.569
 each row this year a separate variety 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.849
 that it was easier to understand later 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 varieties 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.230
 Well, I can not list this time from 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.470

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.870
 the colors were very early ripe 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.760
 first we ate them then with pd2 very 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.970
 well we have been growing here i'm three years old 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 grow pd2 don't necessarily change it 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.470
 soot 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:55.079
 he striped grows up to seven kilograms 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 we are free very much what taste he has 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.360
 super wounds don't go on called then in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.590
 this year put a light it's dark 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.049
 watermelons Siberian lights and early morning mornings 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.069
 hurts already striped Siberian lights and he 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.340
 so green but with very interesting 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.099
 watermelon pattern now they they 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 fill with many large and watermelons 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.790
 here in the middle I have all in the thickets 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.239
 watermelons are not visible but there they are 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.970
 believe me I checked them there a lot under 10 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.150
 June, then they landed in the ground here they are 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.060
 see me grow here's a film here they are 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.170
 then I put the arcs small 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.930
 on the right of the shop and acrylics covered in 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.850
 cold nights because here we have a very 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.000
 cold even before frost but to 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.769
 save well, I probably closed the week 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.170
 two as soon as the flowers appeared I immediately 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.930
 stopped closing it because I 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.500
 do not manually pollinate how greenhouses do 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.299
 they appear to me for this purpose 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.329
 I need to pollinate a lot 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.660
 insects for this soot I phacelia 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.959
 all kinds of mustard 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.540
 herbs grow so that there is a lot 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.269
 insects and that here they are gathering dust themselves 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.950
 how many bees in my work 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.860
 so much and I will have a watermelon 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.580
 Arbuzikov thank you and so I closed them 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 but the beds I have done so 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:35.099
 a way that the grass does not grow under 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.680
 I do n't have grass on this covering sheet 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.349
 and since the paths are very jolly 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.039
 there is no grass in a big layer here either 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.949
 never had them weed and I them 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:50.280
 I do not water because watermelons are very 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.729
 long roots they reach the most 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.919
 small then meter long and wide they 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.719
 can grow to four meters since 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.740
 they and here I don't water them they don't 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:05.039
 accustomed to grow at the top and they immediately chickens 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.860
 Do not give stupid and get water from the depths and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.110
 they have enough because everything is messed up 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.710
 my land does not evaporate here 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.409
 dry constantly constantly wet and there 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.500
 a lot of worms and so here they are 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.449
 grow without watering and in our climate 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.509
 very good you can grow watermelons 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.090
 because here I have been growing for three years 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.520
 about well less than 25 or watermelons I don’t 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.520
 collected and smell them even in this 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.789
 unripe watermelons of our Siberian 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.979
 the smell and taste are much sweeter than the purchased ones 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.580
 if you want to grow watermelons believe 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.110
 it's not hard at all and you grow 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.750
 them and try experiment i 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:52.039
 I wish you good luck in the new year and grow 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.039
 the same harvest as mine 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.289
 you visited my site at the beginning 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.080
 August we showed there watermelons as they 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.419
 I grow on the site now we 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.800
 We are at the exhibition where I brought 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.630
 show the fruits of my work here I have 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.320
 a great harvest of watermelons grew 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.800
 I brought to the exhibition 6 varieties they 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.130
 went to glory and I can list you 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.360
