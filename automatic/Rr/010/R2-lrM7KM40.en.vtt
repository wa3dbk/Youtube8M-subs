00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.260 
difference with this is assister screens
that's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> lot<00:01:33.299> brighter<00:01:33.710> better<00:01:34.710> quality<00:01:35.270> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's a lot brighter better quality so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.460 
that's a lot brighter better quality so
I've<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> gun<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> Houston

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I've got the gun want the Houston

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
I've got the gun want the Houston
expensive<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:39.030> money<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.299> no<00:01:39.450> object

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
expensive but this money is no object

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
expensive but this money is no object
and<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.650> primarily<00:01:41.430> because

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and this is a good one primarily because

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
and this is a good one primarily because
it's<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> bigger<00:01:42.180> screen<00:01:42.500> be<00:01:43.500> bigger<00:01:43.710> than

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's got a bigger screen be bigger than

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
it's got a bigger screen be bigger than
the<00:01:43.950> 800<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> easier<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> read<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.540> know

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the 800 just be easier to read you know

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
the 800 just be easier to read you know
but<00:01:46.020> 800<00:01:46.409> fantastic<00:01:46.890> value<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.729> maps

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
but 800 fantastic value and the maps
here<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.420> crisper<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.200> compared<00:01:49.500> to
