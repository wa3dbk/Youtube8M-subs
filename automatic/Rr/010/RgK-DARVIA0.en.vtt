00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.850
 I'm talking about beautiful basterds from 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.980
 christina lorraine so this book yes 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.559
 it's an erotic romance with all the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.340
 clichÃ©s that we find as usual 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.250
 the handsome charismatic kids boss and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.130
 the trainee or the secretary so there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.210
 for the shot chloe is a trainee who 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 works for bennett ryan 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 beautiful beautiful but the hyper 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 arrogant egocentric that's all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.149
 cliches of erotic novels and the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.270
 particularity of this book we know that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.640
 there it beats all records he fucks at 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 end of the 9th page 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.950
 it made me laugh so much 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 laughter should know that the benefits of 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.980
 book that changes is that we have the point 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 from bennett 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 this is the first time I have them a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.100
 erotic book having the point of view 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.280
 of man and that's something that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 I loved because this couple is just 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.559
 for me to die of life they insult themselves 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.439
 all the time it's very funny when 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 louis speaks to him and that deep down she in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.549
 his head to his say a few hours all 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.840
 stuff like that but it's good for 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.150
 me it's very funny it's a book to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.020
 really take it to the second degree because 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.189
 yes, it's still a little raw 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.259
 you have to be very open minded 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.310
 on this one because it's yes 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 hyper trash words and everything but really 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.770
 if you have a very open mind very 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 second degree like me it goes like 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.460
 a letter to the post office is a treat 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.710
 it's a turn of pages but really 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.619
 it's excellent so this couple me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.259
 really frozen to dirt and even on who 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.070
 is because they have relationships 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.380
 between them 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 hate and love there is only one step 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 and that's really their thing 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.040
 he knows both hate me at once and he gets 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.049
 insulted but it's great not me 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.100
 I wish it's so funny of nothing 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.780
 maybe I 'm fed up with this shot 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.030
 there but for me it was so funny 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.969
 we see who are veiling the face all the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 long the book is really in the end my 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.179
 b net y go here he takes things in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.189
 hand he declares himself and I loved 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.750
 in fact I had bought this book in 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.269
 thinking not to read more because in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.519
 general erotic books like that the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.359
 first well and then after I do not care 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.769
 who got married and had a lot 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.170
 kids really i do not care 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.030
 but here I really want to know 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.519
 how does his relations manager because 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.650
 that she is terrible she is really 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.049
 terrible and well yeah I 'll buy the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.299
 after that it's sure but jacques rey 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.889
 was second in my room 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.299
 because I think I would have done 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.530
 news of the bit was the world rolls 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.220
 normally I had to read with 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.840
 anne-sophie common rector but 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.519
 the abandoned 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.720
 here I fully understand that for 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.329
 some people it's too trashy 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.409
 it's too raw I can totally 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.989
 understand that would be when it starts 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:57.159
 at the end the 9th not relax way where 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.870
 it's going to go this thing but nothing to do 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.560
 but still directly I have the point of 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.500
 view bennett 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.109
 I was just delighted I saw 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.430
 love directly I saw love there ya 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.450
 nothing to do books like that me 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.950
 I have my heart that it makes butterflies 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.049
 everywhere it's madness 1 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.069
 I love it I love it when it says 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.190
 that he is falling in love 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.870
 she added rotrand it was beautiful 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.269
 and I also left myself totally 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.269
 to have by the end I did not think at all 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.739
 that it was going to end like that I love myself 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.479
 to surprise in general I like 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.069
 do not try to guess the end as 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.729
 that I leave totally to see and there 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.260
 it did it I'm really delighted 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.510
 so those who like books 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.099

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.609
 that they have a very very open mind and 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.470
 very second degree it's for you 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.909
