 A confirmation is that like content is stored in addition to the body 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.890

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:17.010

 A detailed spec introduction is a . I'm going to be at home a bit 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.970
 I would like to explain 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.180
 I thought it good when you're battery durability Mone review outta luck 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.039
 Start-up of the current application in Dohai 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.550
 It is ok to leave the Japanese feeling roughly roughly 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.880
 Welcome tone 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.600
 Hey, I'm touched that I little actual bone 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.040
 What is this 6 white and 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.530
 Very Hey, I'm a little touched by it is also 10 group that Tendo 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.190
 Movement is good 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.940
 That sensitivity is 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:42.150
 As it is Octa core this time 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.140
 2 ghz 9 w and 1.5 ghz of the quad and Sunaburo this eight Maruhachi Ichi round 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.140
 We are equipped with 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.750
 That's very true- 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.140
 Even though the terminal performance is high, the power consumption is high. 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.400
 Basically, when the processing section is light, is it? 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.770
 There is no 1.5 worried about has become a form such as the use of the place 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.920
 Performance is just now starting Tochigi, but still you are fine 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.840
 Fast performance Father cheats java 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.840
 If it matches, I will not maintain the performance 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.450
 Well basically biting looks very nice 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.340
 You can do it without problems 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.150
 But the application of Hey fine place I know array is basically Nomou already 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.150
 The version is 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.460
 Because we have 5.0 lollipops 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.130
 Lollipop tired 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.610
 It's good with nori 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.970
 It means that it is included 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.510
 What about version and is one Let's take a look at 5.0 Well detail 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.370

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.370
 Yes Well looks like 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.660
 Let's look at the terminal It can be said that it can be put into a projector or something 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.690
 Version is 5.0 points 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:06.970
 As the processor is up to Qualcomm 3-81 msm 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.720
 It becomes like 1994 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.140
 Yes or more 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.060
 For now at least for the time being Yeah Wadane 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.400
 5 will be up later a 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.150
 If you introduce a detailed introduction color specs on your side, you won't do what you do now this time z 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.690
 One is 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.500
 It's the final stage of the z series, so I really want to go into detail 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.130
