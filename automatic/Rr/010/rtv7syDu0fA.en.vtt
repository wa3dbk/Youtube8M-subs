00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.360 
going to be honest I don't go a whole
lot<00:03:39.090> by<00:03:39.420> what<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.720> FDA<00:03:40.080> says<00:03:40.560> because<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.310> do

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
lot by what the FDA says because they do

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.400 
lot by what the FDA says because they do
a<00:03:41.520> whole<00:03:41.790> lot<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:42.090> telling<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.780> pretty

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
a whole lot of telling you that pretty

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.320 
a whole lot of telling you that pretty
much<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.710> can't<00:03:43.950> dehydrate<00:03:44.460> anything<00:03:45.030> and

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
much you can't dehydrate anything and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.620 
much you can't dehydrate anything and
you<00:03:45.390> can't<00:03:45.570> fan<00:03:45.870> anything<00:03:46.500> because

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
you can't fan anything because

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
you can't fan anything because
personally<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:48.990> because<00:03:49.230> they

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
personally I think it's because they

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.740 
personally I think it's because they
just<00:03:49.800> want<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.490> out<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.910> buy<00:03:51.480> more

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
just want you to go out and buy more

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.170 
just want you to go out and buy more
rather<00:03:52.080> than<00:03:52.550> dehydrating<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.640> saving<00:03:54.030> your

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
rather than dehydrating and saving your

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.050 
rather than dehydrating and saving your
own<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:55.560> anyway<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.460> a<00:03:56.610> personal<00:03:57.000> opinion

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
own but anyway just a personal opinion

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.900 
own but anyway just a personal opinion
so<00:03:58.020> let's<00:03:58.350> move<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.710> and<00:03:58.770> see<00:03:59.010> what<00:03:59.160> else<00:03:59.400> we

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910
