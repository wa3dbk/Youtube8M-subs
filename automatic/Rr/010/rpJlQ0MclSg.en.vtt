 Hello everyone, let's talk about the file 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.280
 hosts 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.330
 but also faced such a problem that 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.420
 the browser stops logging in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.980
 any site and social networks or 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.840

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 specific site 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 if antivirus check did not fix 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 this problem although many now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.660
 antivirus protects the host file from 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.969
 change and restore 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.390
 restore it have programs 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.370
 but we'll see how it is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.239
 happens and how to fix it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.239
 by hand so 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.710

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.270
 antivirus did not find anything go check 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.170

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.170
 which we have on the way drive c 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170

 driver's system32 folder 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:29.830
 here it is system32 and here it is daddy 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.280

 open open with notepad 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 look 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.020
 we are interested in all the records after 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.200
 localhost lines as we see here 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 there is an extra record that's it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.719
 and save the document 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.760
 we are on a pancake as you can see we are 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.500
 system folder they do not give us 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.340
 save file in this folder 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.340
 we will go the other way 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.700
 we are copying the host file 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.000
 for example on disk d 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:50.030
 rule it here open again with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.030
 notepad delete extra lines 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.620
 as you see now 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.920
 we managed to save it what we do 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.970
 then we pick it up from here 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.540
 or cut and transfer to the folder where it is 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:18.280
 should we lie and paste it 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.950
 replace the file in the destination folder 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.410
 administrative rights are required 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.190
 continue all the file we have replaced 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.330
 check 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.330
 also notepad 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.900
 we have all the file clean after that 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.200
 be sure to restart 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.640
 computer to clear informed of course 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.900
 How much do I understand and new settings 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.900
 computer applied 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.250
 I'll show you some more now 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.200
 ways to fix and the host file is not 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.760
 coming in 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.390
 directly to the folder saved him 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.930
 location go to the application looking for 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.930
 notebook 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.980
 run it as administrator 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:30.340
 specify the path to the file hosts 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.699
 recently open places at c3 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.040
 As you can see, the notebook does not see the file like this 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:41.320
 as a hosts file without extension 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.010
 settings show all the files and here 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.010
 our host file 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.180
 opened rule close save so 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.570
 like a notebook we had launched from 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.330
 admin all changes will be saved 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.690
 You can also run a notebook on behalf of 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.070
 admin through the command line 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.880
 we select the command line administrator 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.880
 we enter in English 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.560
 not bad 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:21.790
 again we are starting a notebook from 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.790
 admin again specify the file under 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:35.720
 all files or double click on the file 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.820
 or select take open all look 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:44.780
 construction, if necessary, we close the rules 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.350
 keep not forget after you make 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.040
 changes to reboot if 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:55.070
 Again, these lines appear to know that 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.710
 there is a virus somewhere around you 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.310
 recovers this string and you need 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.350
 before 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.620
 cure the system from the virus then 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:08.620
 edit the file on this all thank you all 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.620
 until
