00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.760
 proteins 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.769
 la fiorentina napoli the film 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.679
 - Florentine, how much I love her 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 but I don't think I can eat a Florentine every time I need to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.769
 protein 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.750
 I know a person who could explain something to us 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.650
 it is white 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.580
 our nutrition expert 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.569
 let's hear what he has to say 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.619
 proteins are formed from twenty-one amino acids also called bricks 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.380
 of life 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.079
 because it is from the different combination of these walls that they can be formed 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.600
 many types of proteins that have very different functions in ours 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.240
 The body's proteins are the skin, hair, nails but also other muscles 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.070
 moriconi who carry out fundamental activities for our life commands 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.379
 example hemoglobin the protein that carries oxygen in the blood ohlins 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.600
 urinates that the hormone that would be there to regulate the amount of glucose in the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750
 within our body 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.470
 in short, really many different substances formed with only twenty-one small 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.370
 moricone but how much protein we need more or less a gram for each 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.229
 kilo of our body weight this means that a person of age 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.850
 adult will need to eat during the day more or less 60 70 grams of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.960
 protein 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.230
 active white 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.570
 you never disappoint me as marco inna fresh f let's see what he tells us about 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020
 proteins preserve proteins 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.330
 we must distinguish two primary preparations for the culture of meat 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.710
 roasted with grill or pan 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.110
 of oven 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
 or by exchange of liquids by immersing an ingredient in the liquid vocabol lore 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.240
 also very important material 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 for example ramen like aluminum is the best heat conductor 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.510
 steel is but only if with abundant aluminum bottom 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.429
 always hot and good to know and salt I feel the end 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 fantastic mark 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.020
 now we hear from pier and that you work as a personal trainer 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.190
 how many exercises we can do thanks to the proteins we eat every day 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.489
 verification of a food bunker and also of training is measured capacity 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.729
 not to excessively affect the amount of protein present in the 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.669
 our body 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.979
 what it means this means that a workout to use 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.859
 predominantly energy substrate supplier of carbohydrates and fats a 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.289
 about balance I will show you an exercise that also has the basis 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.619
 ability and at the arc of movement to gradually set in motion the 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.619
 posterior musculature and anterior musculature 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.619
 you take a handlebar 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
 I would say 4 pounds 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.029
 the weight is brought towards the floor 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.829
 evidently throwing out breath to the central part of the trunk 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.360
 very well 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.400
 I know the time to set up a fitness corner at home next time
