think anyone had ever even come close to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
think anyone had ever even come close to
before<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> halo<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> beginning<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> me

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
before it halo was the beginning of me

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.300 
before it halo was the beginning of me
playing<00:01:19.350> console<00:01:19.710> games<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.280> friends

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
playing console games with my friends

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
playing console games with my friends
and<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:20.939> still<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> always<00:01:21.990> think

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and that's still how I always think

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.550 
and that's still how I always think
about<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.539 

I<00:01:27.470> think<00:01:28.470> people<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.829> been<00:01:29.009> asking<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
I think people have been asking for a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.940 
I think people have been asking for a
remake<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> halo<00:01:30.390> 1<00:01:30.659> since<00:01:31.140> halo<00:01:31.619> 2<00:01:31.799> was

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
remake of halo 1 since halo 2 was

since the 10-year anniversary was coming
up<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.110> occurred<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.439> us<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
up it occurred to us that there's this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
up it occurred to us that there's this
entire<00:01:47.460> generation<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.210> people<00:01:48.810> who<00:01:48.990> never

when<00:01:53.759> halo<00:01:54.090> came<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.079> due<00:01:55.289> diligence

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
when halo came out we did due diligence

when halo came out we did due diligence
on<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> number<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> partners<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:57.000> number<00:01:57.299> one

on a number of partners the number one

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
on a number of partners the number one
requirement<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.590> didn't<00:01:58.890> impact

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009

and<00:01:59.490> play<00:01:59.729> at<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.539> have<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.720> classic<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and play at all you have a classic you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.320 
and play at all you have a classic you
have<00:02:01.380> something<00:02:01.830> that's<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.340> magical<00:02:03.119> right

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
have something that's just magical right

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.910 
have something that's just magical right
if<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.569> go<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.899> tinker<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.409> you're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
if you go and tinker with it you're

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.289 
if you go and tinker with it you're
going<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.100> lose<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.250> magic<00:02:05.729> what<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.030> really

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
going to lose that magic what we really

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.969 
going to lose that magic what we really
needed<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.780> someone<00:02:07.049> who<00:02:07.289> could<00:02:07.319> work<00:02:07.709> with

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
needed was someone who could work with

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
needed was someone who could work with
our<00:02:08.190> existing<00:02:08.340> physics<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> gameplay<00:02:09.750> engine

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
our existing physics and gameplay engine

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.020 
our existing physics and gameplay engine
saber<00:02:10.440> popped<00:02:10.799> up<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.280> quickly<00:02:11.610> they're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
saber popped up really quickly they're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640 
saber popped up really quickly they're
like<00:02:12.209> yeah<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.260> make<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
like yeah we can do this we can make the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
like yeah we can do this we can make the
game<00:02:13.799> look<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.760> current<00:02:15.150> generation<00:02:15.720> game

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
game look like a current generation game

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.320 
game look like a current generation game
and<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.920> do<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.340> using<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.849> original

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and we can do it by using the original

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.900 
and we can do it by using the original
halo<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.019> engine<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.620> gameplay<00:02:20.310> inhale<00:02:20.610> one

the game will behave in the same way and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
actually use them completely so the car

is nice and trainer but zanjan is fairly
old<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.440> we'll<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.859> make<00:02:41.010> sure<00:02:41.220> that

it's<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.819> kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> fits<00:02:42.329> together<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.200> then

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
it's all kind of fits together and then

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.720 
it's all kind of fits together and then
we<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> speed<00:02:44.010> up<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.160> engine<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.609> make

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
can say analyze and this mode comes up

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.310

where you can almost capture items so

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.960 
where you can almost capture items so
you<00:06:27.380> move<00:06:27.590> your<00:06:27.740> cursor<00:06:27.980> over<00:06:28.220> saying<00:06:28.850> a

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
leader a grunt and in the library you

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.380 
leader a grunt and in the library you
can<00:06:31.100> go<00:06:31.400> in<00:06:31.580> there<00:06:31.730> and<00:06:31.850> see<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.210> things

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
can go in there and see the things
