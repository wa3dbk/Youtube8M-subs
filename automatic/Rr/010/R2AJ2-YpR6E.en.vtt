00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
entrapped in a creature that is very

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
entrapped in a creature that is very
agile<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> figure<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> way

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
agile and you have to figure out a way

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.280 
agile and you have to figure out a way
to<00:01:55.979> trap<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.790> into<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> corner<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.049> can

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to trap it into a corner so you can

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
to trap it into a corner so you can
collect<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.680> SAP<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
collect the SAP go from it now there is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
collect the SAP go from it now there is
multiplayer<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> still<00:02:01.530> follows<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
multiplayer but it still follows the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
multiplayer but it still follows the
rule<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:03.030> person<00:02:03.450> playing<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> character

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
at a time one person plays and the other

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.749 
at a time one person plays and the other
uses<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.869> quote-unquote<00:02:07.500> pointer<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.459> help<00:02:08.640> the

their character
and<00:02:12.030> probably<00:02:12.600> my<00:02:12.810> favorite<00:02:13.140> thing<00:02:13.260> about

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and probably my favorite thing about

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.050 
and probably my favorite thing about
this<00:02:13.650> game<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.190> our<00:02:14.310> direction<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> its

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
this game is it's our direction and its

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.640 
this game is it's our direction and its
soundtrack<00:02:15.360> I've<00:02:15.990> reached<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
soundtrack I've reached a lot of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
soundtrack I've reached a lot of
impasses<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.400> some<00:02:17.640> levels<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.450> haven't

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
impasses on some levels and I haven't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.660 
impasses on some levels and I haven't
gotten<00:02:18.870> frustrated<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.550> just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
gotten frustrated and really it's just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.990 
gotten frustrated and really it's just
because<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.800> visually<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.070> just

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
because this game visually it's just

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
because this game visually it's just
cute<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.170> soundtrack<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> really<00:02:26.040> easy

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
cute and the soundtrack is really easy

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.850 
cute and the soundtrack is really easy
going<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.090> fun<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.750> listen<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.140> that's

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
going and it's fun to listen to that's

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.200 
going and it's fun to listen to that's
probably<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.220> real<00:02:29.400> selling<00:02:29.730> point<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:30.150> this

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
probably the real selling point of this

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.880 
probably the real selling point of this
game<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.630> me<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.800> and

mad at it but another interesting

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.720 
mad at it but another interesting

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
Rascals I'm not sure what the other two

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.360 
Rascals I'm not sure what the other two
games<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.740> haven't<00:02:52.920> played<00:02:53.190> them

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
games get because I haven't played them

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.030 
games get because I haven't played them
but<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.910> know<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.150> yellow<00:02:54.450> mellow<00:02:54.600> gets

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
