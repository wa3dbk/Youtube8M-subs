traditionally the way that you do this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
traditionally the way that you do this
is<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.050> whisking<00:00:31.260> together<00:00:31.529> egg<00:00:31.920> yolks<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
is by whisking together egg yolks and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
is by whisking together egg yolks and
lemon<00:00:32.910> juice<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> double<00:00:33.750> boiler<00:00:33.899> until

they're<00:00:34.530> hot<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.800> frothy<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.850> slowly

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
they're hot and frothy and then slowly

whisking in butter in a thin and steady
stream<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.329> whisk<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.320> butter<00:00:40.530> breaks

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
stream as you whisk the butter breaks

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889

into minut droplets while the egg yolk

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
into minut droplets while the egg yolk
acts<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.710> emulsifier<00:00:43.920> helping<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> keep
