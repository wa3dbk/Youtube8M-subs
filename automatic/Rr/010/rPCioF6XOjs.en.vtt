00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.319
 To enter the rx 8 Doo Doo 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.790
 Ares Propress 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.390
 It's a series of amps 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.080
 Well, let 's talk about neutral points 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.850
 Good from the bottom 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.190
 I will explain 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.270
 Well table in the car 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.700
 It is in a state of wearing all fg and motor mount 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.410
 I will work 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.010
 Hula Su-wiring is sure not to be wrong 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.010
 Thank you 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.290
 First of all it is a connector 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.100
 The moon is on the plus side 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.010
 The minus is 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.010
 I will connect to the negative side 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.769
 That's the condition of the transmitter 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.769
 Funeral side put the switch 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.990
 Neutral point and the end point is working with Mueller not a whole state 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.269
 Please give me 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.390
 So 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:14.970
 Turn on the edition pull switch with 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:18.070
 One thing is this kind of thing, so there are 75 LEDs here, though 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 Then in the middle of this 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.520
 If you are in a state of pulling 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.510
 There is no problem laughing at the neutora point or manual 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.370
 Anyway your own 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:37.960
 So in order to match my father, I will set the intile point, though 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:42.840
 Amp mode button on the left side 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 Press and hold for 3 seconds 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.820
 Yes Yes 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 Saying 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.740
 Because the sound of the leaf is included 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.810
 Good at a round-table conference 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.479
 Make it current 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.479
 I will have to as it is so I think has become Nutra 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 After you set the throttle trigger to the previous one 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 Now it And then look over pop is now we back have is put in 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.950
 The chime sound has come again 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.360
 I think that the lamp in the middle of the lamp is lit in this and again in this state 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.150
 Say that I Nyutorari has become properly 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.540
 Because it will be a gold pot 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.620
 This is a neutral point of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.989
 Then after the end point 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.970
 Low point This setting will be half already, so once it is done, turn on the power once 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.970
 Please turn off the amplifier 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.730
 It is completion with this, and have you put a note again in the year again 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.950
 (2) If you are in the middle and you are in neutral 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 Setting the point is there related in this in Well 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.750
 It's Come to move 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.750
 Hey 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.250
 There is no problem if you move 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250
 Here is the end to set the neutral point
