00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.810
 ah 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.210
 you know what the girl says and mental 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.620
 even if it's funny the mental gum 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.900
 are those ideas or thoughts 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.300
 negative that while in our mind 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.070
 for something that happened to us or not 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.469
 it has happened but that already worries us 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.050
 when chewing is a chewing gum you can pass 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.230
 hours and hours doing it and nothing happens 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.089
 well that will not be a waste of time 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.589
 the same is a negative thought for 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.070
 example you spend all day saying 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.589
 because everything goes wrong because never the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.780
 to do things well is to think like that 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.879
 it does not take you to find the solution to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.249
 that negative thought only forms the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.769
 belief that you are bad and all that 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.510
 you make a belief is our own 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.030
 version of the truth but not 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.889
 it must be a belief 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.710
 It is formed when you repeat a thought 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.520
 one and another 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 ra and again 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.240
 never our master 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.189
 the cycle is understood none 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.259
 no no 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 the bass 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.800
 You do not understand me 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.540
 You should be very aware when a 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.430
 negative thinking is growing in 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.230
 your mind as well as when it starts me 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 grow hair today with my stylist 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.590
 so that it affects my head and cut of 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.590
 root those little hairs 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.110
 things are not solved by thinking 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 more in them when you're blocked by 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.910
 negative mean I suggest you do the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.430
 next question is 100% true that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.870
 what am I thinking for example if I say 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.560
 everything goes wrong 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.630
 really ask yourself everything goes wrong or 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.290
 what is specifically what is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290
 going bad 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 in those moments it's good that you start 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.460
 ask yourself what you can do to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.860
 counteract that thought 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.380
 you can make a list of 5 thoughts 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.490
 positives as possible solutions to that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.490
 that does not leave you alone 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.270
 avoid watching television since that puts you 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 very passive and that state makes your 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.640
 thought go around and around until 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.050
 the point of obsessing with something that does not 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.940
 it is very important to the best 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.090
 when there is something that anguishes you 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.910
 forced you to leave home that will help you 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.450
 to distract yourself and accommodate that thought 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.450
 negative 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.420
 will chew mental gum does not allow you 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.480
 communicate with others or with you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.450
 same so remember the chewing gum of the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.540
 negative thoughts stop chewing a 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.760
 thinking that does not lead you to anything 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.489
 much less to a solution and when you see 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.990
 that a harmful thought is growing 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.410
 cut it in the bud 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.600
 your imagination has no limits creates the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 correct thoughts that the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.040
 results you want 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.319
