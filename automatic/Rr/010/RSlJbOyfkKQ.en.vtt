00:00:02.197 --> 00:00:04.705
During the afternoon of a certain day.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.888
Kazuto: ...It's a nice weather.

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:11.846
...That's right.

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:16.346
I was soaking in the pleasant sunlight together with Minmei at the castle garden.

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:20.340
Minmei was off-duty and she invited me to join her in it.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.031
Ah, it's really pleasant.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.141
Kazuto: Right... haha, Minmei's like a cat resting in the sunlight.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.283
Ehe...

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:36.828
Minmei smiled shyly and narrowed her eyes because of the breeze.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:40.939
A calm and cozy atmosphere formed between the two of us.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.100
Kazuto: ...Minmei, you've changed a bit lately.
(Yeah, but in a good side)

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:52.617
Kazuto: You're still serious and straightforward... 
but you're more relaxed and soothing now.

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:56.618
Is that so?

00:00:56.718 --> 00:01:01.440
Kazuto: Yeah. I don't mean anything weird by that. 
How should I put it... you got more mature, I suppose.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.631
Mature, you say...?

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.551
Kazuto: Yeah. Anyway, it feels nice. 

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:18.192
Ehehe... but, it might be weird of me to say it myself, but... you might be right.

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:30.982
Before... I lived mastering in the art of war and thinking of 
nothing but serving Go. I devoted myself to that completely.

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:38.834
I talked to Sai-sama before and she told me "don't be stupid"...

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:41.875
Kazuto: Haha, sounds like something Sai-san'd say.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:55.752
Yes. But, I'm starting to think so myself lately. Thinking that... it's not everything.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:05.220
...Heh. I'm not sure... how to put it myself.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.437
Kazuto: Haha... but I understand you. It's probably the same thing I was trying to say.

00:02:09.537 --> 00:02:22.998
Yeah. My resolve to serve Go did not waver. I'll accomplish 
the missions I'm given. But... that's where I'd stop before.

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:35.833
If that happens... I kept thinking "if that happens". 
But now... I've learned to look a bit further into the future.

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:38.421
Kazuto: ...Right.

00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:49.557
About future... about what'll come for Go and, most important, me and...

00:02:49.757 --> 00:02:53.396
Minmei stopped her phrase there and put her hand on her own stomach.

00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:58.675
Heh, I've thought of a name for this child.
(...Well... that's why you did it, but isn't that too early for that?)

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.428
Kazuto: Already? That was fast.

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:07.779
Hehe. I thought of going with the name Shushu.
(Oh, surprisingly, that's the name that appeared in the epilogue.)

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.821
Kazuto: Shushu, huh. Sounds good.
(Knowing Baseson, I thought they'd forget what happened in other scenes)

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:13.736
Yes.

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.186
Kazuto: Minmei...

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:20.876
Ah, Kazuto-sama...

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:25.272
I embraced Minmei with a big smile, which made her 
a bit surprised at first, but she immediately relaxed.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:31.121
...I'm glad I fell in love with Kazuto-sama.
(This is surprisingly a bit different from usual last events)

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:34.861
Kazuto: Fufu, hearing you say that reassures me as a man.

00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:39.105
Hehe... ah!

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:43.469
Minmei let out a loud voice as if noticing something and escaped my embrace.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.214
Looking in the same direction as Minmei, I noticed a single cat approaching us.

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.655
Cat: Nya.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:53.066
Cat-sama.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:58.575
Minmei's eyes started shining at the sight of that cat, 
but following it, several more cats arrived.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:01.901
At the closer look, they're holding something in their mouths.

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:06.662
...? What is it?
(A cockroach?)

00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:10.675
And cats started placing what they had in their mouth before Minmei.
(...A tribute to the cat queen?)

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:18.199
Oh! I'm touched! Kazuto-sama.

00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:24.667
Cats brought us the gifts of celebration!
(All hail the Cat Queen Minmei!)

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:28.507
It appears they were the celebration presents for Minmei.
(What kind of sorcery happened here?)

00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:34.261
They were flowers they picked somewhere, some beautiful stones...
and something they probably caught, a several insects.

00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:39.407
It appears they figured out our relationship with their 
animal intuition &lt;?&gt; and arrived to give us their blessing.

00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:51.348
Eh? You're letting me pet you!? Thank you! Au, au... it's so fluffy.

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:55.998
It appears just for today, normally tsundere cats 
don't try to escape when Minmei touches them.

00:04:56.098 --> 00:05:01.791
This fluffiness is the best.

00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:05.767
Minmei petted them with the happiest kind of face.

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:08.712
Kazuto: I need to cherish this.

00:05:08.812 --> 00:05:13.442
Looking at Minmei being like that, I make up 
my mind to cherish her as much as possible.

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:17.919
So that Minmei's happiness would last as long and strongly as possible.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:23.692
Kazuto-sama? Did you say something?

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:27.994
Kazuto: No, it's nothing... Haha, Minmei, you look happy.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:33.501
Yes! I'm very very happy!

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:39.334
It felt like Minmei's bright as the sun smile mounted the breeze and spread all around.
