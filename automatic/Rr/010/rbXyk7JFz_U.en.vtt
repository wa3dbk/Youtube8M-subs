00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.070
 the realmadrid that has accessed the 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.130
 quarterfinals of this cup of the king 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.230
 after asserting the advantage that 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.910
 brought the first leg in Santiago 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.950
 bernabéu where he won by 2 goals to 0 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.610
 ronaldo Christian that today was 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.610
 protagonist 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.449
 it was the first game in which he premiered his 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.369
 golden ball and who has celebrated it 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.360
 this way with this free throw 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.430
 than that of a strange Andrey 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.340
 and the osasuna goalkeeper who is running out 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.120
 swallowing in the 22nd minute of the game the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 Real Madrid put with 0 goals to 1 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.160
 He already gained an advantage and sentenced the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.309
 eliminator in case it was not yet 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.870
 enough the launch very powerful 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.010
 of number 7 of real madrid 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.940
 that has been difficult to stop for 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 the goalkeeper of the local team the real 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.390
 madrid has played mostly against 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.739
 commanded by ronaldo Christian during 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.710
 the minutes that you have been on the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 pitch this is a pitch 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 right after the goal that this time and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.750
 André has placed the body well and has 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.480
 finishing taking the ball 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.850
 with his left leg this is a 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.299
 free kick for osasuna 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.659
 would come over the guard of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.179
 goalkeeper defending iker squares 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.240
 I was lamenting that I could not 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.590
 connect well enough with the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 ball is cisco 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.429
 the one who tried to baste a play and 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.859
 the final launch of xabi alonso 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.479
 with left leg that goes away 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.000
 little bit above the crossbar 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.500
 André's are the best minutes of the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 Real Madrid after the goal 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.060
 of Christian and this is a launch to 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.550
 Cejuda stick good shot with leg 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.310
 left that squares could not reach 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 touch and that ended up crashing against 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.860
 the right pole of the goal 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.140
 Real Madrid 'were the best 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 minutes of osasuna that was going back to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.069
 find inside the match here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.319
 we will see another launch this one of miguel 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.859
 of the caves and this time yes 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 what squares finishes clearing to corner 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:22.110
 it was the minutes just before going to 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.900
 changing rooms 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.310
 before the first part finished and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.079
 osasuna was trying to leave 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.629
 matching the match this is one of the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.170
 key plays in which preceded the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.480
 second goal by xabi alonso the pass on 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.430
 and that and that which goes by speed makes 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.739
 the death pass where the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.920
 argentinian angel di maria that with her 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.359
 left leg accommodates the ball to the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.879
 left by Andre Fernandez who does not 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.610
 can do nothing to avoid the second 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.380
 Real Madrid goal good move by hesse 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.080
 the players of osasuna of 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.200
 that in the beginning the play here xabi 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.110
 Alonso needed about Miguel de las 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.700
 caves the question is that the ball finished 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.760
 at the feet of gs 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 which he spilled over to all who put 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.319
 in the middle and ended up giving the goal to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.049
 fideo di maria 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.840
 the 02 since he left the game more than 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.959
 sentenced entered morata that in this 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.060
 play would have very bad luck with his 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.170
 own left hand here you will see it 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.959
 I would hit in the face 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.990
 and you would end up swelling your eye 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.990
 left 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.290
 very bad luck for the front of the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.180
 real madrid that enjoyed a few minutes 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.819
 to claim here they have it as 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.709
 that eye has swollen quickly 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.090
 left we have seen him in various 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.050
 times to tell your classmates that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.120
 is that I did not see anything I was really dizzy 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.610
 the Real Madrid striker that still 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.240
 has followed a few minutes on the ground 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.420
 of game will be a launch 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.070
 of osasuna that would end up stopping iker 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.070
 squares the launch of wedges 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.470
 and here will come the expulsion of fabio 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.180
 coentrao here what have you seen 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.370
 a yellow card for protesting a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.560
 throw-in at the end of the first 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.919
 part 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.200
 and that would see the second and therefore the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.520
 expulsion after this lack more than 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.389
 clear 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.039
 about oller 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.419
 here they have it as it raises the leg 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.419
 very up with entry 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.869
 more than deserved expulsion 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.339
 for the Portuguese who was returning to the 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.949
 playgrounds and here they see as morata 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:44.269
 it's over dizzing a lot already 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.269
 He had to leave the field 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.320
 between tears surely for the rage 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.180
 of having had this bad luck and not 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.770
 be able to take advantage of these minutes on the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.670
 pitch the game would end 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.670
 with this release 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.320
 from osasuna de torres 21 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.020
 that would stop iker boxes and send 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.110
 to corner shoot here would die the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.090
 I find the 0-2 that places the real 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.330
 madrid in quarterfinals of the cup 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.330
 King
