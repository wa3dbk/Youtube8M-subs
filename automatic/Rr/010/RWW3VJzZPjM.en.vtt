of nine articles and every month I made
a<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.840> plane<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.890> after<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.550> people

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
a different plane so after that people

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
a different plane so after that people
will<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> touch<00:00:48.649> saying<00:00:49.649> oh<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.820> the

article I'd love to love to make when I
was<00:00:53.160> jet<00:00:53.430> planes<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> don't<00:00:54.180> think<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> could

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
was jet planes but I don't think I could

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.040 
was jet planes but I don't think I could
would<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.039> me<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.870> for<00:00:57.870> quite

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
would you make one for me and for quite

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
would you make one for me and for quite
a<00:00:58.079> while<00:00:58.289> people<00:00:58.530> getting<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> touch<00:00:59.190> asking

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a while people getting in touch asking

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.630 
a while people getting in touch asking
me<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> making<00:01:00.239> planes<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.920> decided<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
me to making planes and I decided to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
me to making planes and I decided to
launch<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.480> website<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.659> start<00:01:06.659> making

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
launch a website and and start making

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.800 
launch a website and and start making
plans<00:01:07.020> oh<00:01:07.409> yeah<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.340> love<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> simplicity<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
plans oh yeah I love the simplicity of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
plans oh yeah I love the simplicity of
wooden<00:01:10.500> planes<00:01:10.880> essentially<00:01:11.880> you've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
wooden planes essentially you've got a a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.499 
wooden planes essentially you've got a a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
surface it also leaves a flat surface

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.710 
surface it also leaves a flat surface
with<00:01:31.590> sandpaper<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> smooth

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
with sandpaper you can get a smooth

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.530 
with sandpaper you can get a smooth
surface<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> doesn't<00:01:35.130> necessarily<00:01:35.540> keep

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

it<00:01:36.689> flat<00:01:37.220> also<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:39.229> get<00:01:40.229> fine<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it flat also you don't get fine and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
it flat also you don't get fine and
sawdust<00:01:41.479> flying<00:01:42.479> around<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> workshop<00:01:43.290> for

sawdust flying around the workshop for

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
sawdust flying around the workshop for
you<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> inhale<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.280> using<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> plane<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you to inhale then using a plane so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
you to inhale then using a plane so
planes<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.680> work<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.399> quicker<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:48.420> allow

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
planes they work much quicker they allow

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
planes they work much quicker they allow
you<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> work<00:01:49.020> -<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.189> fine<00:01:50.340> tolerances<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you to work - very fine tolerances that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.770 
you to work - very fine tolerances that
they<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> work<00:01:52.590> flatter<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.780> then

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
they make you work flatter and then

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.270 
they make you work flatter and then
leave<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.079> workshop<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.710> healthier

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
leave your workshop a little healthier

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.510 
leave your workshop a little healthier
it<00:01:56.939> shows<00:01:57.350> customers<00:01:58.350> often<00:01:58.500> ask<00:01:58.770> why<00:01:59.460> should

smoother so by having a brass Sal has

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.080 
smoother so by having a brass Sal has
quite<00:04:35.880> an<00:04:36.210> extra<00:04:36.660> weight<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.320> plane<00:04:37.530> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
quite an extra weight to the plane and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.180 
quite an extra weight to the plane and
