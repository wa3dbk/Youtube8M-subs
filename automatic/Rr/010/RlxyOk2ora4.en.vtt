00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.809 
right into that Canyon they'll all die
boats<00:04:13.419> will<00:04:13.599> go<00:04:13.690> around<00:04:13.900> no<00:04:14.769> sheep<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.639> have<00:04:15.790> a

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
boats will go around no sheep you have a

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.969 
boats will go around no sheep you have a
whole<00:04:16.090> flock<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.419> dead<00:04:16.720> sheep<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
whole flock of dead sheep so the

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.509 
whole flock of dead sheep so the
Shepherd<00:04:18.400> has<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.729> keep<00:04:18.909> the<00:04:19.150> path<00:04:19.389> straight

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
Shepherd has to keep the path straight

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.800 
Shepherd has to keep the path straight
so<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.639> Sheep<00:04:21.849> don't<00:04:21.970> have<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.300> go<00:04:22.389> in<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.570> curve

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
so the Sheep don't have to go in a curve

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.120 
so the Sheep don't have to go in a curve
so<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.139> Shepherd<00:04:23.409> first<00:04:23.620> goes<00:04:23.740> over<00:04:23.979> there

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
so the Shepherd first goes over there

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.270 
so the Shepherd first goes over there
and<00:04:24.159> says<00:04:24.630> well<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.960> then<00:04:26.440> here<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:26.979> and

and says well and then here what and
then<00:04:27.849> here<00:04:28.090> whoa<00:04:28.270> ah<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.840> path<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.169> always

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
then here whoa ah so the path is always

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.500 
then here whoa ah so the path is always
straight<00:04:30.010> when<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.460> Shepherd<00:04:30.789> calls<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.330> go

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.980 
at that point a bunch of us took an
easier<00:07:33.030> way<00:07:33.240> because<00:07:33.540> we<00:07:33.630> didn't<00:07:33.810> have<00:07:33.900> to

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
easier way because we didn't have to

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.420 
easier way because we didn't have to
climb<00:07:34.200> way<00:07:34.380> down<00:07:34.560> and<00:07:34.770> then<00:07:34.890> way<00:07:35.010> up<00:07:35.040> it<00:07:35.340> was

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
climb way down and then way up it was

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.490 
climb way down and then way up it was
easier<00:07:35.670> to<00:07:35.730> step<00:07:35.940> above<00:07:36.210> so<00:07:37.110> we<00:07:37.230> didn't<00:07:37.380> see

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
easier to step above so we didn't see

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.590 
easier to step above so we didn't see
