00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
built-in navigation as well so it really

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.600 
built-in navigation as well so it really
has<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.739> features<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.250> would<00:02:25.430> really

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
has all the features that I would really

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.699 
has all the features that I would really
help<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.239> modern-day<00:02:26.630> vehicle<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
help for in a modern-day vehicle of this

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.180 
help for in a modern-day vehicle of this
price<00:02:27.950> point<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:29.480> think<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> navigation

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
price point and I think the navigation

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.910 
price point and I think the navigation
system<00:02:31.459> works<00:02:31.700> rather<00:02:32.360> well<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.830> all

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
system works rather well and it's all

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.800 
system works rather well and it's all
easily<00:02:34.130> controlled<00:02:34.580> by<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.730> middle<00:02:35.239> knob

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
easily controlled by this middle knob

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.750 
easily controlled by this middle knob
here<00:02:36.140> which<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.680> just<00:02:36.709> almost<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
here which is just almost just like the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.810 
here which is just almost just like the
ones<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.300> see<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> Acura<00:02:39.080> models<00:02:39.350> and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
ones that we see in the Acura models and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.220 
ones that we see in the Acura models and
might<00:02:40.820> take<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.060> little<00:02:41.209> bit<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:41.959> used<00:02:42.170> to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
might take a little bit to get used to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.479 
might take a little bit to get used to
at<00:02:42.350> first<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.860> pretty<00:02:42.980> easy<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
at first but it's pretty easy at the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.990 
at first but it's pretty easy at the
hang-up

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
hang-up

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.820

the engine is mated to a six-speed
automatic<00:02:46.310> transmission<00:02:46.340> there<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> sport

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
automatic transmission there is a sport

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.910 
automatic transmission there is a sport
mode<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.260> see<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> can<00:02:48.560> shift<00:02:48.739> down

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
mode as you can see I can shift down

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.280 
mode as you can see I can shift down
into<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:50.450> really<00:02:50.600> gives<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.050> driver

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
into that and it really gives the driver

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.290 
into that and it really gives the driver
a<00:02:51.410> nice<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.800> more<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.400> aggressive<00:02:52.880> feel<00:02:53.090> to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
a nice and more of aggressive feel to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.810 
a nice and more of aggressive feel to
the<00:02:53.450> car<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.080> did<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.250> cars<00:02:55.459> overall

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the car I did like the cars overall

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.940 
the car I did like the cars overall
performance<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.480> handling<00:02:56.959> as<00:02:57.200> much<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.860> a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
performance the handling as much it's a

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.440 
performance the handling as much it's a
little<00:02:57.980> bit<00:02:58.190> more<00:02:58.280> SUV<00:02:58.519> like<00:02:59.000> than<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.300> would

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
little bit more SUV like than it would

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.850 
little bit more SUV like than it would
be<00:02:59.540> sedan<00:02:59.870> like<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.709> bit

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
be sedan like so it's a little bit

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.559 
be sedan like so it's a little bit
looser<00:03:01.160> than<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.370> would<00:03:01.519> probably<00:03:02.209> have

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
looser than I would probably have

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.630 
looser than I would probably have
personally<00:03:03.319> liked<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:03.650> overall<00:03:03.950> still<00:03:04.280> give

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
personally liked but overall still give

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.259 
personally liked but overall still give
a<00:03:04.670> good<00:03:04.910> sign<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.920> stability<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:08.090> kind

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
a good sign of stability and that kind

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.120 
a good sign of stability and that kind
of<00:03:08.329> thing<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.930> one<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.440> course<00:03:09.590> does<00:03:09.980> have

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
of thing so this one of course does have

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.009 
of thing so this one of course does have
the<00:03:10.340> integrated<00:03:11.180> sunroof<00:03:11.570> we<00:03:11.750> don't<00:03:11.900> get<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
the integrated sunroof we don't get a

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
spacious car overall and I think Honda's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.080 
spacious car overall and I think Honda's
really<00:03:22.280> hit<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> mark<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.850> what<00:03:22.970> they're

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
really hit the mark on what they're

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.150 
really hit the mark on what they're
trying<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.420> do<00:03:23.570> here<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.019> do<00:03:24.650> realize<00:03:25.010> it's

have that mouse nice little camera

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.150 
have that mouse nice little camera
feature<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:48.170> over<00:03:48.290> this<00:03:48.560> whole

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
feature so it's going over this whole

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.270 
feature so it's going over this whole
thing<00:03:49.400> again<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.700> think<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:50.440> once<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.530> get<00:03:51.799> an

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
thing again I think that once you get an

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.250 
thing again I think that once you get an
idea<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.820> what<00:03:53.030> Honda's<00:03:53.420> doing<00:03:53.630> here<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.989> think

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
idea of what Honda's doing here I think

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.860 
idea of what Honda's doing here I think
you'll<00:03:54.410> really<00:03:54.650> be<00:03:54.769> impressed<00:03:55.329> with<00:03:56.329> most

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
you'll really be impressed with most

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.190 
you'll really be impressed with most
everything<00:03:57.380> in<00:03:57.500> here<00:03:58.299> if<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.690> car<00:03:59.900> drives

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
everything in here if the car drives

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.319 
everything in here if the car drives
really<00:04:00.680> well<00:04:00.829> I'm<00:04:01.609> going<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.820> take<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.299> a

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
really well I'm going to take it for a

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.810 
really well I'm going to take it for a
little<00:04:02.390> spin<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:03.160> again<00:04:04.160> this<00:04:04.280> prefers<00:04:04.609> the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
little spin here again this prefers the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.460 
little spin here again this prefers the
paddle<00:04:05.120> shifters<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.630> appointed<00:04:05.930> our

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
paddle shifters that appointed our

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.540 
paddle shifters that appointed our
and<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.640> think<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.010> customer<00:04:10.430> that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
and I think that the customer that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.830 
and I think that the customer that
drives<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:10.940> thing<00:04:11.150> with<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:11.360> great<00:04:11.510> thing<00:04:11.690> but

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
drives this thing with a great thing but

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.710 
drives this thing with a great thing but
don't<00:04:12.080> really<00:04:12.320> be<00:04:12.530> impressed<00:04:12.980> by<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.790> power

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
don't really be impressed by the power

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.770 
don't really be impressed by the power
that's<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.470> angel<00:04:15.860> really<00:04:16.010> develops<00:04:16.780> it

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
that's this angel really develops it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.650 
that's this angel really develops it
seems<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.140> develop<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.590> at<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.860> relatively

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
seems to develop it at a relatively

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.200 
seems to develop it at a relatively
quick<00:04:20.660> method<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.830> know<00:04:22.040> this<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.730> staff<00:04:22.940> say

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
quick method I know this the staff say

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.390 
quick method I know this the staff say
that<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.600> gets<00:04:23.930> its<00:04:24.110> full<00:04:24.290> torque<00:04:24.560> at<00:04:24.710> 4,900

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
that it gets its full torque at 4,900

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.360 
that it gets its full torque at 4,900
p.m.<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.850> it's<00:04:25.940> full<00:04:26.090> force<00:04:26.300> power<00:04:26.510> at<00:04:26.570> 62<00:04:26.960> RPM

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
p.m. and it's full force power at 62 RPM

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.340 
p.m. and it's full force power at 62 RPM
but<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.580> few<00:04:29.420> minute<00:04:29.720> gives<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.110> when<00:04:30.260> you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
but a few minute gives you when you

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.290 
but a few minute gives you when you
drive<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.770> seems<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.340> lot<00:04:31.460> more<00:04:31.490> responsive

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
drive it seems a lot more responsive

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.990 
drive it seems a lot more responsive
than<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:32.930> really<00:04:33.770> good<00:04:33.890> job<00:04:34.070> on<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.610> Honda
