00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
crosshair size 216 is about three yeah I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.810 
crosshair size 216 is about three yeah I
think<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.000> something<00:01:48.180> like

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820

and you can even make it even better

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.830 
and you can even make it even better
with<00:01:52.390> crosshair<00:01:53.220> draw<00:01:54.220> outline<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.660> can

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
with crosshair draw outline and you can

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.930 
with crosshair draw outline and you can
make<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.350> three<00:01:56.770> or<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.580> get<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:57.910> a
