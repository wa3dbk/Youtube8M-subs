00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so I'm moving on to the insides going to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.580 
so I'm moving on to the insides going to
tilt<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> car<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:54.229> k<00:01:55.229> dolls<00:01:55.439> with

nice that's the mumble monster probe

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
nice that's the mumble monster probe
mostly<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.909> actually

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
mostly that's in there it's actually

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.960 
mostly that's in there it's actually
least<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> was

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
least it was

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.700

official<00:02:01.300> upgrades<00:02:01.660> from<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.900> structure<00:02:02.230> /<00:02:02.290> 4

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
official upgrades from the structure / 4

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.980 
official upgrades from the structure / 4
by<00:02:02.860> 4<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.150> was<00:02:04.270> obvious<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:04.570> was<00:02:04.780> one<00:02:04.900> of

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
by 4 so it was obvious that was one of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.290 
by 4 so it was obvious that was one of
the<00:02:05.050> first<00:02:05.230> things<00:02:05.350> we<00:02:05.620> gonna<00:02:05.800> do<00:02:06.300> obviously

these little nifty traxxas connectors

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.290 
these little nifty traxxas connectors
which<00:02:38.500> allows<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.430> two<00:02:39.580> batteries<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.090> run

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
which allows the two batteries to run

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.110 
which allows the two batteries to run
together<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.520> other<00:02:42.610> things<00:02:42.700> as<00:02:42.940> one

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
together one of the other things as one

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.940 
together one of the other things as one
of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.270> Miami<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.020> run<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.380> 6l
