you<00:01:48.540> can't<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.960> exact<00:01:49.350> angles<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.040> 45

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you can't have exact angles of 45

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.120 
you can't have exact angles of 45
degrees<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.170> weight<00:01:52.409> distribution

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
degrees or you know weight distribution

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920

all<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> other<00:01:53.520> stuff<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:54.149> protect

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
all this other stuff just protect

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
all this other stuff just protect
yourself<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> keep<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
yourself so you want to keep the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
yourself so you want to keep the
movements<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.119> simple<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.479> possible<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.140> it's

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
movements as simple as possible so it's

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.109 
movements as simple as possible so it's
just<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> contract<00:01:59.579> palm<00:01:59.759> flare<00:01:59.969> goes

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
just like a contract palm flare goes

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.649 
just like a contract palm flare goes
here

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
here

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.020 
here
finger<00:02:01.200> dad<00:02:01.409> goes<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.770> -<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
finger dad goes there - this is really

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
finger dad goes there - this is really
good<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.600> women<00:02:03.869> especially<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.409> they're<00:02:04.590> if

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
good for women especially if they're if

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
good for women especially if they're if
they're<00:02:05.399> smaller<00:02:05.909> than<00:02:06.420> their<00:02:06.630> attacker

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
they're smaller than their attacker

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.780 
they're smaller than their attacker
because

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
because

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
please don't hurt me and all of a sudden

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.950 
please don't hurt me and all of a sudden
you<00:02:10.280> throw<00:02:10.430> this<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.880> their<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.660> their<00:02:11.780> eyes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
you throw this to their to their eyes

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.440 
you throw this to their to their eyes
and<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.770> course<00:02:13.010> his<00:02:13.490> instinct<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.240> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
and of course his instinct is to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.570 
and of course his instinct is to
probably<00:02:14.900> cover<00:02:15.230> his<00:02:15.410> eyes<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.010> sets<00:02:16.370> up

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
probably cover his eyes and that sets up

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.730 
probably cover his eyes and that sets up
so<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.360> come<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.720> smash<00:02:18.140> his<00:02:18.320> face<00:02:18.500> of

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
so I can come in and smash his face of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.410 
so I can come in and smash his face of
something<00:02:19.070> out<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.880> know<00:02:20.000> punching<00:02:20.330> them

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
something out you know punching them

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.390 
something out you know punching them
throughout<00:02:20.630> whatever<00:02:20.960> I<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.320> do<00:02:21.410> but

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
it's just a straight line shot point A

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.160 
it's just a straight line shot point A
to<00:02:24.950> point<00:02:25.070> me<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.760> principle<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.780> always<00:02:27.020> want

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
to point me the principle we always want

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.760 
to point me the principle we always want
to<00:02:27.200> keep<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.500> mind<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.160> called<00:02:28.460> closest<00:02:29.060> weapon
