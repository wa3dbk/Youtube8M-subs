00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
despite doing all the stealth killing

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.390 
despite doing all the stealth killing

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.439 
this part this is my second playthrough
for<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.949> mission<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.770> objective<00:04:53.919> wasn't

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
for the mission the the objective wasn't

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.120 
for the mission the the objective wasn't
entirely<00:04:55.449> clear<00:04:55.870> if<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.320> asked<00:04:56.680> me<00:04:56.800> because

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
entirely clear if you asked me because

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.620 
entirely clear if you asked me because
the<00:04:57.280> first<00:04:57.430> time<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.699> played<00:04:57.880> through<00:04:58.270> this

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
the first time I played through this

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.990 
the first time I played through this
Ariel's<00:04:59.110> on<00:04:59.350> elite<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.010> elite<00:05:00.190> mod<00:05:00.639> when<00:05:00.910> you

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
Ariel's on elite and elite mod when you

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.450 
Ariel's on elite and elite mod when you
get<00:05:01.120> shot<00:05:01.419> you<00:05:01.900> don't<00:05:02.110> go<00:05:02.560> down<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:03.070> just<00:05:03.250> die

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
get shot you don't go down you just die

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.480 
get shot you don't go down you just die
so<00:05:04.289> once<00:05:05.289> I<00:05:05.470> eventually<00:05:05.860> completed<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.400> I

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
so once I eventually completed it I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.550 
so once I eventually completed it I
didn't<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.479> challenge<00:05:07.840> unlocked<00:05:08.169> which

didn't have the challenge unlocked which
I<00:05:08.650> couldn't<00:05:08.830> understand<00:05:09.190> because

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
I couldn't understand because

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.790 
I couldn't understand because
technically<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.120> didn't<00:05:10.600> go<00:05:10.690> down<00:05:10.990> but<00:05:11.590> what
