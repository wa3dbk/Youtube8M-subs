what you want that's what I did so here
we<00:01:21.550> go<00:01:21.580> my<00:01:22.450> own<00:01:22.660> personal<00:01:22.990> preference<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:24.070> that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
we go my own personal preference is that

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.470 
we go my own personal preference is that
I<00:01:24.580> like<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.490> cool<00:01:28.390> whip<00:01:28.600> topping

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
I like more of the cool whip topping

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.360 
I like more of the cool whip topping
than<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.960> pudding<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.830> mix<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.190> like<00:01:33.310> a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
than the pudding so I mix it like a

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.810 
than the pudding so I mix it like a
three<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.850> one<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.920> would<00:01:36.070> probably<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.790> a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
three to one but it would probably be a

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.780 
three to one but it would probably be a
two<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:37.810> most<00:01:37.990> people<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.680> two<00:01:39.280> tubs<00:01:39.550> of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
two to one for most people a two tubs of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.630 
two to one for most people a two tubs of
whipped<00:01:40.750> topping<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.440> one<00:01:41.710> box<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.310> pudding

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.350 

or<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:52.020> who<00:01:52.050> aren't<00:01:52.440> using<00:01:53.360> sugar

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
or for the people who aren't using sugar

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
or for the people who aren't using sugar
free<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.410> use<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
free you could use just one of the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.560 
free you could use just one of the
larger<00:01:57.270> tubs<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.720> regular<00:01:58.170> cool<00:01:58.410> whip<00:01:59.330> per<00:02:00.330> box

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
larger tubs of regular cool whip per box

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
larger tubs of regular cool whip per box
I<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.900> add<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.290> pudding<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.860> between<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
I like to add the pudding in between the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
I like to add the pudding in between the
cool<00:02:09.360> whip<00:02:09.570> because<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> pudding<00:02:12.860> because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
cool whip because the pudding because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.440 
cool whip because the pudding because
the<00:02:14.010> pudding<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:15.570> powdery<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.180> makes<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the pudding is powdery it just makes it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
the pudding is powdery it just makes it
easier<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.900> think<00:02:18.990> put<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:19.980> between<00:02:20.130> layers

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
easier I think put it in between layers

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.910 
easier I think put it in between layers
of<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.600> cool<00:02:21.840> whip<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.410> started<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
of the cool whip to get you started so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.350 
of the cool whip to get you started so
that<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.280> powders<00:02:23.640> not<00:02:23.820> going<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that the powders not going all over the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:36.050 
that the powders not going all over the
place<00:02:25.010> or<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.070> least<00:02:26.220> not<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.550> bad

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.440 

then<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.330> want<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:38.730> fold<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.090> till<00:02:40.360> it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
then you just want to fold it in till it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.000 
then you just want to fold it in till it
starts<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.130> mixed<00:02:42.130> up<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
starts to get mixed up so that the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.510 
starts to get mixed up so that the
powder<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.490> not<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.820> everywhere<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.040> then

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
powder is not going everywhere and then

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.850 
powder is not going everywhere and then
once<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.820> get<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> powder<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:50.290> covered

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
with all the cool up then you can get in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.350 
with all the cool up then you can get in
there<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.510> really<00:02:52.750> start<00:02:53.020> mixing<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.500> up

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360

the day that you're going to actually
serve<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.070> otherwise<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.610> bananas<00:03:48.970> get<00:03:49.150> mushy

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
serve it otherwise the bananas get mushy

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.910

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
that although these are sugar-free

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.920 
that although these are sugar-free
ingredients<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.620> fruit<00:04:26.950> etc<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:28.060> not<00:04:28.600> low
