00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:14.012
This is the brand new Honda Civic!

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:20.852
To the untrained eye it might as well be a facelift, 
 but it isn't. 95% of the car is new.

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:25.552
It is designed in Europe for europeans, and 
 is being built by europeans in Europe.

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:26.946
Specifically in the UK

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:31.900
As such, the suspension and design in general is targeted at us europeans -

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:35.457
- and when I say suspension, it's because 
 us europeans, contrary to many other places,

00:00:35.628 --> 00:00:38.750
like a firm ride, and indeed that is what 
 we have here, but I'll return to that...

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.602
The goal for Honda with this Civic has been to try 
 and raise it to a new level of refinement,

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:47.612
regarding quality, fit and finish.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.863
And, let me get this said right off 
 the bat, they have achieved just that.

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:55.159
But, the real question is, how it gets down the road...

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:02.092
As soon as you set foot in the Civic 
 you get a sense of rigid quality.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:08.990
Nice and lovely, fat leather steering wheel, and leather 
 on the gear lever as well, 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.425
- everything, the instruments, the selection of plastics 
 around the cabin, it's all tastefully done.

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.288
And the instruments are placed just right, everything is 
 placed where you need it to be.

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:30.113
The steering feedback is direct and sporty, and the gearshifts equally so -

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:33.399
- with easy, short and precise movement.

00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:38.912
And the we have the suspension, which is firm as you 
 would expect in an S-model like this one -

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:43.290
- it whips around bends in a lovely, almost neutral way -

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.580
- ever so slightly understeering if driven hard.

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.820
But all in all it adds up to an impressive, complete package.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:57.110
On the slightly more negative side, the only things you notice are little niggles.

00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:00.360
Visibility in the rear is poor, but so 
 is it with most cars today -

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.810
- though the beam across the rear window doesn't help.

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:10.760
 Then there is the key, again a small 
 niggle, but it is a bit wobbly.

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:15.310
And it is hard to fold with one hand 
 and it easily unfolds in your pocket.

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:22.420
It's a small but annoying detail, especially in a car of this price range...

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.590
It really shouldn't be the case.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.670
Then there is the placement of the cup holders -

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.880
- just aft of the gear lever.

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:36.060
When you go to change into 4th or 6th it's not the 
 optimum position if you have a cup placed in it.

00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:38.220
It's very easy to knock it over by accident.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:43.340
Regarding fuel consumption, Honda promises an average around 6L/100km -

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:47.250
- and you know what, for once we have 
 a car that lives up to those numbers.

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.090
And you can actually surpass those numbers very easily.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:56.040
A trip to Germany on the Autobahn with a 
 speed ranging between 130 and 160 km/h -

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.600
- in smooth traffic, and you get 6.6L/100km.

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:03.940
And that is actually very impressive in a 
 car with a 1.8 litre petrol engine.

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:09.570
And eh... Now our intern Niels will tell you a bit about the engine.

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:16.280
Underneath the hood on this new Civic beats a 1798cc, 4-cylinder engine -

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:23.840
- it produces 142hp at 6500rpm, and 174nm at 4300 rpm.

00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:26.430
But it feels like a lot more...

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:30.240
It delivers the power to the front wheels through a 6-speed, manual transmission -

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:35.220
- which helps it to achieve a 0-62mph time of 
 9.4 sec. and a top speed of 133.5 mph.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.310
The level of noise is very low

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.800
The wind-noise is barely noticeable, and tires - well you have to 
 drive over some pretty rough surfaces before they become annoying.

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:48.690
Then there is the engine, when you're really pushing 
 it close to the top speed -

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:52.610
- it starts to chirp in quite a bit...

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:57.420
The level of comfort equipment is quite vast. I'll 
 let Niels tell you a bit about that.

00:03:57.627 --> 00:03:59.320
You really get your money's worth here.

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:06.970
It is very well equipped considering the price.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.590
It comes with a nice, 6-speaker stereo with CD-player.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.690
Though I'm surprised they don't offer Bluetooth connectivity as 
 standard like on so many other recent cars.

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:28.130
In the center console, underneath the armrest, we find lot's 
 of options for hooking up aftermarket equipment -

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:35.540
- there is an extra 12v socket for your GPS or phone 
 charger, and a USB connector and AUX plug for your iPod.

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.960
Comfort equipment is also plentiful -

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.250
- with cruise control and a twin zone climate control system.

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:45.460
But that is what we've come to expect from new cars in 2012.

00:04:45.548 --> 00:04:50.280
I can't help but wonder why they haven't 
 fitted a GPS system as standard, -

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:55.050
- since there is a nice color screen in 
 the dash already for the reverse camera.

00:04:55.551 --> 00:05:00.040
The Honda fully meets the safety demands all cars face today.

00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:03.890
It comes with 6 airbags, ESC and ABS.

00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:09.880
In addition to all that, you get a 
 rain censor and this small ECON-button. 

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:16.060
Which is something I would advise potential buyers of this car 
 to try and turn off when test-driving the car.

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:18.380
But Mick will tell you more about that now.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.800
The ECON-button turns the car into a completely different animal.

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:28.350
It can turn the engine from being a responsive, dynamic 
 thing with lots of get up and go -

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:35.010
- to being dull. So if you have trouble keeping your right 
 foot steady, and would like to drive economically - 

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:40.710
- then a press of that button will keep a lid on 
 things, and you will get more miles to the gallon.

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.450
And then a funny thing I don't experience very often -

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:49.060
- since I'm only 5'8" tall. But the seat cushions 
 are actually a bit too short for me.

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:54.040
And I mean, it's a car designed in 
 Europe, built in Europe, to europeans -

00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:58.540
- then I find it a bit surprising, even though it's 
 a japanese car. They should be able to do better.

00:05:58.782 --> 00:06:03.380
And our intern Niels, who is 6'4", his thighs 
 get next to no support with those seats.
