00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.419 

I<00:00:00.120> know<00:00:00.630> there<00:00:01.110> are<00:00:01.140> two<00:00:01.380> really<00:00:01.860> fascinating

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I know there are two really fascinating

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.710 
I know there are two really fascinating
things<00:00:02.669> about<00:00:03.799> about<00:00:04.799> human<00:00:05.130> evolution<00:00:05.609> that

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
things about about human evolution that

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.450 
things about about human evolution that
we<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.870> yet<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.080> really<00:00:07.649> fully<00:00:08.010> get<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> grips

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
we have yet to really fully get to grips

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.039 
we have yet to really fully get to grips
with<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.450> evolution<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> cooking

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
with and one is the evolution of cooking

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.419 
with and one is the evolution of cooking
whenever<00:00:13.049> cooking<00:00:13.440> happened<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.009> must<00:00:14.309> have

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
whenever cooking happened it must have

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.500 
whenever cooking happened it must have
had<00:00:14.610> absolutely<00:00:15.389> monstrous<00:00:15.870> effects<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.039> us

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
had absolutely monstrous effects on us

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.450 
had absolutely monstrous effects on us
because<00:00:18.510> cooking<00:00:18.750> enormous<00:00:19.590> ly<00:00:19.800> increases

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because cooking enormous ly increases

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.929 
because cooking enormous ly increases
the<00:00:20.580> quality<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> food<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.660> eat<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.939> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the quality of the food we eat and it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
the quality of the food we eat and it
enormous<00:00:24.600> ly<00:00:24.779> increases<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> range<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.099> food

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
enormous ly increases the range of food

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
enormous ly increases the range of food
items<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.150> eat<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.710> know

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
items that we can eat and we all know

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.120 
items that we can eat and we all know
that<00:00:29.250> food<00:00:29.550> quality<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.240> food<00:00:30.900> abundance<00:00:31.170> are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that food quality and food abundance are

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.450 
that food quality and food abundance are
key<00:00:32.940> variables<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.840> understanding<00:00:34.680> animal

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
key variables in understanding animal

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.569 
key variables in understanding animal
ecology<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.350> amazing<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.309> at

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
ecology and the amazing thing is that at

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.690 
ecology and the amazing thing is that at
the<00:00:38.670> moment<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.989> no<00:00:40.700> conventional

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the moment there is no conventional

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
the moment there is no conventional
wisdom<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.629> says<00:00:43.670> when<00:00:44.670> cooking<00:00:45.590> evolved

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
wisdom that says when cooking evolved

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910 
wisdom that says when cooking evolved
and<00:00:47.129> yet<00:00:48.120> social<00:00:49.110> anthropology<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> all

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and yet social anthropology and all

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
and yet social anthropology and all
sorts<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.219> conventional<00:00:50.670> wisdom<00:00:50.789> says<00:00:51.539> yeah

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
sorts of conventional wisdom says yeah

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.770 
sorts of conventional wisdom says yeah
humans<00:00:52.620> are<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.770> animal<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.579> cook<00:00:53.879> we

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
humans are the animal that cook we

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
humans are the animal that cook we
distinguish<00:00:55.320> ourselves<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> rest<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> the

distinguish ourselves in the rest of the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
distinguish ourselves in the rest of the
world<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:56.969> roll<00:00:57.360> stuff<00:00:57.660> wheat

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
world because they roll stuff wheat

cooked<00:00:58.350> stuff<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> best<00:01:00.809> anthropology

cooked stuff the the best anthropology

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
cooked stuff the the best anthropology
can<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> moment<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:03.059> maybe

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
can do at the moment is to say maybe

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
can do at the moment is to say maybe
sometime<00:01:04.379> around<00:01:04.769> 250<00:01:05.309> 300<00:01:05.729> thousand<00:01:06.030> years

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
sometime around 250 300 thousand years

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830 
sometime around 250 300 thousand years
ago<00:01:06.680> cooking<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:08.400> got<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:09.030> because

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
ago cooking really got going because

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.920 
ago cooking really got going because
there's<00:01:10.500> evidence<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.010> earth<00:01:11.310> ovens

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
there's evidence of earth ovens

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
there's evidence of earth ovens
archaeologically<00:01:12.930> well<00:01:13.380> fine<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.250> mean

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
archaeologically well fine but I mean

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
archaeologically well fine but I mean
long<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:15.060> Earth<00:01:15.240> ovens<00:01:15.570> came<00:01:15.810> along<00:01:16.080> we

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
long before Earth ovens came along we

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
long before Earth ovens came along we
must<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> learned<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> cook<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.970> would

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
must have learned to cook and you would

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
must have learned to cook and you would
think<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.509> cooking<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> associated

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
think that cooking would be associated

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
think that cooking would be associated
with<00:01:19.979> things<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.090> evidence<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> body<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with things like evidence in the body of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.560 
with things like evidence in the body of
the<00:01:23.790> food<00:01:24.060> being<00:01:24.330> easier<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> digest<00:01:25.049> such<00:01:25.979> as

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
the food being easier to digest such as

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
the food being easier to digest such as
smaller<00:01:27.570> teeth<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.909> maybe<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> ribcage

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
smaller teeth and maybe the ribcage

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.140 
smaller teeth and maybe the ribcage
getting<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.470> bit<00:01:31.680> smaller<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> size

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
getting a little bit smaller as the size

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.550 
getting a little bit smaller as the size
of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> stomach<00:01:34.259> gets<00:01:35.100> smaller<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> jaw

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of the stomach gets smaller and the jaw

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.630 
of the stomach gets smaller and the jaw
getting<00:01:37.860> smaller<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.460> one

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
getting smaller and there's only one

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
getting smaller and there's only one
time<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> human<00:01:39.270> Aleutian<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
time in a human Aleutian and all that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.280 
time in a human Aleutian and all that
happens<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:41.390> that's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.570> 1.9<00:01:43.079> million

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
happens and that is that's a 1.9 million

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.450 
happens and that is that's a 1.9 million
years<00:01:43.500> ago<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> evolution<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
years ago with the evolution of the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.899 
years ago with the evolution of the
genus<00:01:44.490> Homo<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.909> there

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
genus Homo and I think that it's there

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870 
genus Homo and I think that it's there
we<00:01:48.210> must<00:01:48.570> look<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.170> thinking<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:50.100> when

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
we must look for thinking about when

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
we must look for thinking about when
cooking<00:01:51.479> occurred<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.070> cooking

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
cooking occurred and then when cooking

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
cooking occurred and then when cooking
happens<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.000> completely<00:01:54.659> changes<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.229> way

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
happens it completely changes the way

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.780 
happens it completely changes the way
that<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> alum<00:01:56.159> will<00:01:56.250> exploit<00:01:56.579> its

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that the alum will exploit its

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
that the alum will exploit its
environment<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> instead<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.469> moving

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
environment because instead of moving

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.740 
environment because instead of moving
from<00:02:00.000> fruit<00:02:00.899> patch<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.439> food<00:02:01.649> patch

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
from fruit patch to food patch

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.679 
from fruit patch to food patch
and<00:02:03.750> eating<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.549> eating<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and eating as they go or eating in the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
and eating as they go or eating in the
food<00:02:06.869> patches<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.500> find<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
food patches that they find now for the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.110 
food patches that they find now for the
first<00:02:08.819> time<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.569> accumulate<00:02:10.050> food

until<00:02:15.409> it's<00:02:15.950> cooked<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.430> might<00:02:16.819> take<00:02:17.000> 20

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
until it's cooked it might take 20

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.059

take several hours and the effect of
that<00:02:21.409> is<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.580> sudden<00:02:22.819> there's<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
that is that all of a sudden there's a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.440 
that is that all of a sudden there's a
stealable<00:02:24.080> food<00:02:24.409> patch<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:26.120> once<00:02:26.269> you're<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
stealable food patch and once you're a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.059 
stealable food patch and once you're a
stealable<00:02:26.780> food<00:02:27.080> patch<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.500> means<00:02:27.769> that

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
stealable food patch that means that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.130 
stealable food patch that means that
life<00:02:28.459> being<00:02:28.730> what<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.019> somebody's<00:02:30.019> going

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
to come along and Trance do that and I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.330 
to come along and Trance do that and I
think<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.019> this<00:02:33.170> means<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:33.829> you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
think that what this means is that you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.850 
think that what this means is that you
have<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.670> think<00:02:34.819> about<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.860> producer

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
have to think about a a producer

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.880 
have to think about a a producer
scrounger<00:02:37.459> dynamic<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.299> which<00:02:38.329> you've<00:02:38.629> got

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
scrounger dynamic in which you've got

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.990 
scrounger dynamic in which you've got
individuals<00:02:39.890> producing<00:02:40.459> an<00:02:40.579> individual

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
individuals producing an individual

individuals producing an individual
scrounging<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.989> probably<00:02:42.440> females

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
scrounging and that probably females

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.289 
scrounging and that probably females
will<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.280> producers<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.940> males<00:02:44.120> will

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
will the producers and males will

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.559 
will the producers and males will
scroungers<00:02:44.840> once<00:02:45.829> you've<00:02:46.010> got<00:02:46.190> males<00:02:46.569> bigger

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
scroungers once you've got males bigger

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.349 
scroungers once you've got males bigger
than<00:02:47.690> females<00:02:48.049> 50%<00:02:48.590> bigger<00:02:48.709> by<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.040> time

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
than females 50% bigger by the time

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.990 
than females 50% bigger by the time
we're<00:02:50.359> talking<00:02:50.510> around<00:02:50.959> 2<00:02:51.319> million<00:02:51.500> years<00:02:51.680> ago

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
we're talking around 2 million years ago

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.770 
we're talking around 2 million years ago
then<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> effects<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:55.909> social<00:02:56.299> system<00:02:56.599> would

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
then the effects on social system would

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.860 
then the effects on social system would
be<00:02:57.040> large<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.420> think<00:02:59.510> what<00:02:59.750> we've

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
be large and really I think what we've

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140 
be large and really I think what we've
got<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> think<00:03:00.170> about<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.739> idea<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.340> that

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
got to think about is the idea that that

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.289 
got to think about is the idea that that
once<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.140> females<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:05.829> ready<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:07.609> make<00:03:08.269> a

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
once you have females I ready to make a

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.080 
once you have females I ready to make a
meal<00:03:08.659> by<00:03:09.079> collecting<00:03:09.769> food<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.370> cooking<00:03:10.819> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
meal by collecting food and cooking it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.300 
meal by collecting food and cooking it
then<00:03:11.959> they're<00:03:12.230> vulnerable<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.920> having<00:03:13.069> that

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
then they're vulnerable to having that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
then they're vulnerable to having that
food<00:03:13.670> taken<00:03:14.239> away<00:03:14.510> by<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.380> scroungers<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
food taken away by the scroungers the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.539 
food taken away by the scroungers the
big<00:03:17.090> males<00:03:17.389> who<00:03:17.780> find<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.109> easier<00:03:18.500> not<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:19.040> go

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
big males who find it easier not to go

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.129 
big males who find it easier not to go
and<00:03:19.700> collect<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.970> food<00:03:20.150> themselves<00:03:20.750> or<00:03:20.870> cook

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
and collect the food themselves or cook

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.979 
and collect the food themselves or cook
it<00:03:21.260> but<00:03:21.440> just<00:03:21.650> take<00:03:21.889> it<00:03:22.069> once<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.370> ready<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it but just take it once it's ready and

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.270 
it but just take it once it's ready and
therefore<00:03:23.989> they<00:03:24.109> need<00:03:24.139> protective<00:03:24.799> bonds<00:03:25.190> in

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
therefore they need protective bonds in

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.479 
therefore they need protective bonds in
order<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.579> protect<00:03:25.880> themselves<00:03:26.030> from

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
order to protect themselves from

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.979 
order to protect themselves from
thieving<00:03:28.489> males<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.209> less<00:03:29.389> is<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.660> think<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
thieving males and less is I think the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.319 
thieving males and less is I think the
origin<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.500> their<00:03:30.650> male-female<00:03:31.310> pair<00:03:31.519> bond

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
origin of their male-female pair bond

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.229 
origin of their male-female pair bond
well<00:03:32.930> that's<00:03:33.139> a<00:03:33.319> that's<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.980> huge<00:03:34.370> topic<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
well that's a that's a huge topic the

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.210 
well that's a that's a huge topic the
cooking<00:03:35.690> topic<00:03:36.079> that<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.650> virtually

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
cooking topic that is virtually

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.610 
cooking topic that is virtually
completely<00:03:37.579> neglected<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.629> whatever<00:03:39.139> view

you<00:03:39.799> take<00:03:39.829> about<00:03:40.280> cooking<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:40.940> have<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.290> say

you take about cooking you have to say

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.960 
you take about cooking you have to say
it's<00:03:42.919> a<00:03:43.040> problem<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.519> needs<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.849> be

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
it's a problem that needs to be

it's a problem that needs to be
addressed
