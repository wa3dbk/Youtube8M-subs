00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello friends let cristian duke of the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.810
 strands.com page today I went to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 gym in has shoulders and biceps and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.150
 when I was in the gym a guy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.310
 he was doing biceps and it was difficult 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.340
 a little exercise 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.770
 then I to help this boy 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.210
 I stopped him in the front and help him with the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.020
 fingers like that to raise the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 bar and good we did the replays 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.950
 I had planned but choose look how 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.500
 that as I am here we are going to make a 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.870
 repetition to force a force raf and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 You do not know what I'm not interested in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 do that already with this already with this is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 well he got up two he went to talk 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.660
 that followed a little later 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.590
 talking on the phone a person who does not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590
 take it very seriously 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.860
 I do not know how it inspired me in a way 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.320
 or another will be this video because the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.090
 people who go to the gym if you go 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.410
 you go to the gym and just as I will 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.660
 I recommend that you do what you believe 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 what can you do but if you have a friend or 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.449
 a person who wants to offer help 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.189
 take advantage of that help and not only do 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.530
 what you have planned but make a 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.869
 repeat more because the body about 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.180
 all the muscles grow when there 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.119
 repetitions to force is to say when 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.799
 one can lift 80 90 percent 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.659
 but I have a person with my hand and I 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.520
 has gone a little bit more because then 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.880
 there the body grows and that's where the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.530
 muscle responds repetition 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.659
 6 7 8 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 perfect but the ninth where where you 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.170
 he has to give all the strength he has and 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.240
 until it's not enough yet and the person 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.670
 it helps there is with the muscle grows there 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.350
 is when you destroy the muscle to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.240
 can recover later with the protein 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.920
 and with the fat and with the care so that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 the next time I go to the gym 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 I can lift more and I can lift it 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.770
 with better shape 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.850
 but there are but there are people who go to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 gym that for example dress fashion 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.320
 of the bodybuilder bus in the vocabulary of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.260
 bodybuilder but they are not bodybuilders in the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.230
 sense that they do not push or is not 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.290
 they have that confidence or that dedication of 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.650
 push yourself from sweating of little less than 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.230
 cry of pain that does not have it and is what 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.180
 that separates bodybuilders from people 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.270
 that simply looks like bodybuilding 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.320
 and I want to tell you terms 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.840
 that if you consider yourself 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.760
 bodybuilders the bodybuilder does not 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.770
 He speaks on the phone in the gym on 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.930
 Bodybuilder has no conversations 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.370
 half an hour an hour in the gym the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.860
 bodybuilder when he enters the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.930
 gym and enter everything neat but 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.300
 when it comes out it has to leave unless 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.040
 he dows he has to leave sweaty he has 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.080
 to get out exhausted has to leave 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.090
 fatigued he has to go shitty 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.100
 hungry because that shows that the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.650
 trained bodybuilder if you give the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.630
 gym with the same clothes and it comes out 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.730
 same clothes and does not sweat and is not fatigued 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.800
 and the bones do not hurt and he does not have 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.380
 hunger so that the gym did not 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.480
 nothing then I think that these are 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.610
 these are ways to distribute the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.370
 Bodybuilder of the person who believes 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.680
 bodybuilder but that is not I am 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.680
