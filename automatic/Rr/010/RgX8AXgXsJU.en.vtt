can I place a piston down your sticky

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.609 
can I place a piston down your sticky
piston<00:01:32.609> right<00:01:32.969> there<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.990> off<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> sides

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
piston right there then off to the sides

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.300 
piston right there then off to the sides

you place statistics like that okay this
was<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.149> be<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.359> block<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> used

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
was this will be the block that you used

was this will be the block that you used
to<00:01:42.259> make<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.560> blocks<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.219> these<00:01:44.429> two<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to make down blocks with these two are

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
to make down blocks with these two are
necessary<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.729> make<00:01:47.729> sure<00:01:47.939> that

necessary to do with the make sure that
the<00:01:48.329> first<00:01:48.719> because<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.829> turn<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.069> on

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
the first because we in turn this on

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.350 
the first because we in turn this on
this<00:01:50.369> will<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> first<00:01:50.789> letter<00:01:51.090> make<00:01:51.329> sure

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
this will be the first letter make sure

this will be the first letter make sure
the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:51.840> red<00:01:52.140> stone<00:01:52.380> goes<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> bond

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the first red stone goes to the bond

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.609 
the first red stone goes to the bond
piston<00:01:53.609> and<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.630> gotta<00:01:54.780> link<00:01:54.929> these<00:01:55.170> ones<00:01:55.469> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
piston and you gotta link these ones to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.639 
piston and you gotta link these ones to
the<00:01:55.649> other<00:01:56.479> other<00:01:57.479> ones<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.259> break<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the other other ones like just break the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
the other other ones like just break the
stone

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990 

and<00:02:07.990> there<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.259> go<00:02:08.430> it's<00:02:09.430> all<00:02:09.580> hooked<00:02:09.790> up

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and there you go it's all hooked up

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.410 
and there you go it's all hooked up
ready<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> quick<00:02:11.860> test

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
ready to go and for a quick test

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980 
ready to go and for a quick test
shouldn't<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.690> any<00:02:13.810> problems<00:02:14.200> with<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.940> yep

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
shouldn't be any problems with this yep

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.140 
shouldn't be any problems with this yep
to<00:02:16.990> test<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.740> turn<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.820> this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
to test it just turn on and if this

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.630 
to test it just turn on and if this
block<00:02:19.540> gets<00:02:20.020> pulled<00:02:20.440> off<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.920> side<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
block gets pulled off to the side that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.090 
block gets pulled off to the side that
means<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.570> it's<00:02:23.170> not<00:02:23.320> working<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:23.980> to

means that it's not working you have to

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.010 
means that it's not working you have to
try<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.340> again<00:02:24.540> sometimes<00:02:25.540> they'll<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:25.990> that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
try it again sometimes they'll do that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.860 
try it again sometimes they'll do that
for<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> reason<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.390> place<00:02:28.660> your

for a reason and I just place your
diamond<00:02:29.770> blocks<00:02:30.040> right<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:31.000> top<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.540> don't

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
diamond blocks right on top of it don't

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.170 
diamond blocks right on top of it don't
duplicate<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> hundred<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.580> them<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180

watching again you can just watch some

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.290 
watching again you can just watch some
earlier<00:02:50.860> videos<00:02:51.310> they're<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.760> same<00:02:51.940> thing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
earlier videos they're the same thing

there's no change to the diamond

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.970 
there's no change to the diamond
generator<00:02:55.030> because<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.410> still<00:02:56.650> have<00:02:56.800> not

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
generator because they still have not

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.300 
generator because they still have not
fixed<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:58.860> make<00:02:59.860> sure<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.130> comment
