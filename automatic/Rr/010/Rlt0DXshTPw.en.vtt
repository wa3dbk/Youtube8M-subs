00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.869
 also for so long that we did not see each other 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.990
 you hear exactly how much curiosity 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.110
 emerges and who gives that opportunity in the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 world of music to emerge is born king 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.210
 well, it was given, the truth was not given 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.650
 that was something great but whoever 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 gave the opportunity is here who was 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.840
 his godfather and who was 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.610
 you come, I trust you, we met 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 a guy named Miguel 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.720
 trujillo they work and that was to say 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.580
 all right 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.410
 and with him we started hand in hand what 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.270
 we find the semantic producer 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.040
 cyber that many years was the product 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.260
 Luis Honey the type of Aries and those records 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.780
 for very hard and with them we started 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.700
 record we signed contract with sony from there 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.150
 we left with our current 30 that is 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.150
 westwood 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.620
 although July's good luck out of the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 spotlight that July already in life 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.950
 familiar in everyday life not that July 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.560
 no time of july son s july 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.159
 brother, how do you say that? 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.439
 good time 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.170
 I am very much being with my friends being with 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.700
 my family do you do with friends I 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.039
 I really like to go to eat, it's not active 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.130
 you love the table tops 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.719
 love to spend the rich much to live 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.429
 the moments are very intense then 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.899
 suddenly during now if I was 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.459
 happens or you do not know what a saint is left 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.520
 with mezcal we are going to give a talk 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.920
 come on I do not love that you write livas 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.959
 shortened says is that that is the success that 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.909
 has had king we also derive many 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.530
 of the letters and the content not even 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.360
 the won awards because they boast more 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.930
 if the truth is that it is something that is 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.060
 very beautiful from the first record that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 it gave me to compose framework that I made a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 first song and it goes like it hurts 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.030
 with a cousin of mine called roberto 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.069
 but it was very strange, not like July 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.899
 put a song if they were already ten no more 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.080
 not then or again a eros 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.480
 you do not like it anymore because you liked the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.400
 village father does not hear also makes you a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200
 ask here of the bridge before ou 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.580
 so much tour that almost from here you vote 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.580
 since the bitch is going to sing 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.920
 which is to tell you that you already say the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.920
 truth the truth is that I would like 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.890
 But I like it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.700
 come back are two songs that play the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.040
 acoustic guitar 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.550
 incredible its use is very accurate 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.200
 and he listens to guitar and voice to those notes 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.209
 and you can not go wrong is wrong 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.220
 disguise then is an intimate moment 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.840
 and rigid we simply have to see 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.690
 linked in the fashion world 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.880
 you consider yourself fashionistas because of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.840
 where is born that good taste is born 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 Well, I love it because obviously 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.459
 I started just making music I 'm not going 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.650
 love of art you do not realize that 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.000
 also in the love of art he has business 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.890
 and you 're aware that you like to dress 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.900
 well that you like to feel good 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.660
 see yourself well then everything is cause and 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.000
 effect and everything you like a circle in 360 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.000
 that is appreciated and to conclude 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.349
 characteristics 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:02.069
 and I believe a lot in the idea of being for 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.690
 my state so there is a story 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.800
 many compositions 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.320
 have been beaten 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.940
 infinitely as sterile and the type is 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.370
 a guy who dresses amazing 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.370
 he has class he is not introverted 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.970
 of life and singing 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.970
 that so that implant 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
