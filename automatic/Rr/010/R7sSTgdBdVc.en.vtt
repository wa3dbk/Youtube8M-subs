risk of adverse sexual side effects that
can<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.270> caused<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> interaction

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
can be caused from the interaction

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
between the DHT and testosterone can you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
between the DHT and testosterone can you
give<00:01:49.409> us<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.430> information

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

about provillus the first part is
topical<00:01:54.149> application<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.869> essentially<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
topical application so essentially it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
topical application so essentially it's
a<00:01:55.350> liquid<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.950> would<00:01:56.070> massage<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
a liquid that you would massage and this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.030 
a liquid that you would massage and this
liquid<00:01:57.119> contains<00:01:57.719> minoxidil<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:58.619> minoxidil

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
liquid contains minoxidil what minoxidil

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
liquid contains minoxidil what minoxidil
does<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.700> helps<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> stimulate<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
does is helps to stimulate the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
does is helps to stimulate the
capillaries<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.770> hair<00:02:01.890> molecules

increasing<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> protein<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> actually

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
increasing the protein that actually

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
increasing the protein that actually
gets<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> hair<00:02:04.680> itself<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.369> second<00:02:05.700> part

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gets to the hair itself the second part

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.219 
gets to the hair itself the second part
of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> process<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> supplement<00:02:06.990> that's

actually taken orally
now<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.330> supplement<00:02:09.690> contains<00:02:10.170> are

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
now what this supplement contains are

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.150 
now what this supplement contains are
DHT<00:02:11.069> blocking<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.790> grade

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
DHT blocking and grade

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.710 
DHT blocking and grade
it's<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.550> will<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> exact<00:02:13.270> same<00:02:13.450> thing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it's that will do the exact same thing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690 
it's that will do the exact same thing
it'll<00:02:13.960> allow<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.650> right<00:02:14.830> proteins<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.430> flow

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
it'll allow the right proteins to flow
