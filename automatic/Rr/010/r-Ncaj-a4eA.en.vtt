00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.149 
inside the phone very carefully we've
created<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.390> new<00:01:52.569> much<00:01:53.080> smaller<00:01:53.500> lightning

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
created the new much smaller lightning

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.520 
created the new much smaller lightning
connector<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:55.119> all<00:01:55.420> digital<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.319> it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.160 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:57.100> today's<00:01:57.490> uses<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.959> made<00:01:59.140> it

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.669 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.399> fits<00:02:00.670> on<00:02:00.909> your<00:02:01.090> way<00:02:01.679> we

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
reversible so it fits on your way we

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.550 
reversible so it fits on your way we
