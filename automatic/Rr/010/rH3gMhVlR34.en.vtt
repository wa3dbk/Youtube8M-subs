to be conscious of the fact that you do
not<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.880> length<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.449> hair<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.960> order<00:00:25.170> to

not have the length of hair in order to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
not have the length of hair in order to
fill<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.740> gaps<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.400> good<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.210> doing<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
fill in gaps a good way of doing this is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.839 
fill in gaps a good way of doing this is
getting<00:00:28.710> rid<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> those<00:00:29.400> shorter

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
getting rid of some of those shorter

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.389 
getting rid of some of those shorter
layers<00:00:30.090> where<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> longer<00:00:32.219> layers

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
layers where you have the longer layers

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.819 
layers where you have the longer layers
and<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.270> overall<00:00:33.750> length<00:00:34.079> hanging

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and that your overall length hanging

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.190 
and that your overall length hanging
you're<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> put<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.239> tail<00:00:36.540> comb<00:00:36.840> in

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you're going to put your tail comb in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.340 
you're going to put your tail comb in
the<00:00:38.070> middle<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.640> head<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.870> here

the middle of your head right back here
and<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.550> zigzagging

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and you're going to do that zigzagging

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930 
and you're going to do that zigzagging
partings<00:00:42.950> once<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> nape<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
partings once you get to the nape of the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.680 
partings once you get to the nape of the
neck<00:00:45.000> simply<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> tail<00:00:46.649> comb<00:00:46.980> and

pull<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.840> hair<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> side<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:50.430> that'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pull your hair to the side what that'll

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.850 
pull your hair to the side what that'll
create<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.340> zigzag<00:00:53.789> pattern

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
create is a bit of a zigzag pattern

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
create is a bit of a zigzag pattern
that'll<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> help<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.600> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that'll kind of help when you have your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
that'll kind of help when you have your
partings<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> won't<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.949> any<00:00:58.980> spots

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
partings that it won't have any spots

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
partings that it won't have any spots
and<00:00:59.789> there<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.210> any<00:01:00.449> holes<00:01:00.809> within

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and there will not be any holes within

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.000 
and there will not be any holes within
the<00:01:01.410> updo

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the updo

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
the updo
since<00:01:02.940> she<00:01:03.149> does<00:01:03.390> again<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.110> shorter<00:01:04.500> hair

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
since she does again have shorter hair

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
since she does again have shorter hair
I'm<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> separate<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.720> section

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I'm going to separate now that section

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.550 
I'm going to separate now that section
into<00:01:07.740> two<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.420> sections<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:10.049> smaller

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
into two other sections two smaller

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.480 
into two other sections two smaller
sections<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.330> our<00:01:13.490> small

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
sections and I'm going to use our small

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
sections and I'm going to use our small
rubber<00:01:14.760> bands<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.630> better<00:01:15.780> for

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
rubber bands which are better for

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.130 
rubber bands which are better for
smaller<00:01:16.439> diameters<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.570> small<00:01:18.869> rubber

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
smaller diameters are the small rubber

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
smaller diameters are the small rubber
bands<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.770> come<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.189> clear<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bands can come in clear which I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
bands can come in clear which I
recommend<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.080> blends<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.070> it's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
recommend because it blends in and it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
recommend because it blends in and it's
not<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.939> hard<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.299> cover<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:25.049> come<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
not that hard to cover they come in

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
not that hard to cover they come in
black<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.189> come<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> brown<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
black and they also come in brown you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
black and they also come in brown you
can<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:27.990> much<00:01:28.080> buy<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> any<00:01:29.030> CVS

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
can see the difference already how you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.620 
can see the difference already how you
don't<00:02:20.980> really<00:02:21.310> necessarily<00:02:21.460> see<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.390> clear

don't really necessarily see the clear

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.390 
don't really necessarily see the clear
one<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:22.900> how<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.260> black<00:02:23.530> one<00:02:23.770> stands<00:02:24.130> out<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
one and how the black one stands out a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
one and how the black one stands out a
little<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.910> if<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> rubber

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
little bit if you do not have a rubber

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.680
