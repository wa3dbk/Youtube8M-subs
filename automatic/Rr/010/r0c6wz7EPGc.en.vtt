 If it's only called, it 's a thousand. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.540

 gleison is the book of two boys who 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.730
 share the same name 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 Guess which one to English is obviously 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.100

 He is an nerdy misfit boy. 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.070
 few friends but friends he likes and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.140
 he's super smart and he's a cliché of 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.560

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.600
 better than the original including not 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.739
 I know how they will produce the team here. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.620
 It's going to be small under mining in a year. 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.840
 great funk dribble gift is always 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.450
 with lowercase letters and this 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.370
 this game takes a more sad life and 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.150

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 His mother and he has depression. 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.299
 diagnosed knows the ones you have 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.910
 than taking a medicine to control and 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.650

 will cleisson English not found and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.900
 then the friend changes everything forever 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.120
 joinville was solved in three 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 each chapter where the respective thousand 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.530
 Grayson and this did not meet to see 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.739
 who had done nothing and when 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.200
 they saw what the other did and just did not 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.130
 God will work and play 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.100
 writing 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.170
 But it worked out. 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.840
 Good, I can not tell who passes our 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.490
 trust me in the middle I see my bresson 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.710
 the book that I do not all 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.090
 say I could go I did not realize that 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.680
 I came in the end because talent in the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.010
 kindle and when I got there I had a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.810
 Truth did not give up, because it ended. 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.370
 even has a boring kindle thing 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.280
 Did not you notice that it's not coming in? 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.080
 end I say you want percentages until 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.750
 Sunday, but I do not notice it. 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.990
 full - time writing of both authors 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.960
 It's very delicious and their mix is ​​something 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.020
 different exotic johnny issue more 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.240
 delicate to tell the facts and and get 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.120
 his attention as the drag would make more 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.640
 he catches his attention from another 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.140
 way and even from this book you see two 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.930
 authors in this way differently than 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.380
 write and work so well that you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.500
 make a feel of a tasty one but 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.690
 now I'll be sincere and sergipe in that 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.030
 I specifically found the book 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.500
 character created by the driver is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.900
 much more friendly and much more 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.540
 friendly than the one created by bad play 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.820
 in the sense of its great sound of a 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.040
 great you plus a character among 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.770
 several of us are seeing this 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.210
 modern literature and young adults between 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.340
 some similar characters I can only 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.800
 quote the invisible sharjah suffrages 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.260
 Harvesting to obtain an even breakage and 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.970
 swimsuit today who are you alasca 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.840
 so there is no great 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.690
 novelty in terms of characters do not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.630
 bring and already the goose must have light fan has 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.100
 more personality than more depth 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.680
 comparison of the characters in the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.870
 book ends up earning much more 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.280
 even more than meat and the true 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.300
 protagonist of the story 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.390
 branches was by that girle looking ne 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.670
 it's called we will hasson but in one 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.640
 comma to stay at my waiter and this 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.560
 this village villain taís to shorten 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.900
 complete there in the middle of the two places 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.670
 and if you want to opt for Brazilian Portuguese 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.380
 I can tell you that the English team is not 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.320
 commercial but not as graceful 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.920
 Technician is my friend. I like a bad one. 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.110
 As I said before, but he also 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.000
 crying for falling in love he's the star 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.590
 American football team and he 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.260
 is obsessed with writing a musical 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.600
 who talks about himself 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.290
 but then we never have a chapter 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.020
 that the story is centered on it and 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.150
 revolve around dog breeding and did not 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.850
 You talk too much so just know that 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.920
 is in Cuba has its own orbit and 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.240
 this joke of author or co-author 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.430
 we end up having a good story 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.040
 sensitive approach that addresses current and 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.500
 important as depression acceptance 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.100
 of others as well as of oneself and 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.380
 Here it goes 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.870
 and I'm not quite several parts of the 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.420
 book but all were parts of the river and 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.410
 vitali funk sound was to him that me 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.910
 I identified 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.800
 That's what I really wanted 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.990
 several dialogues in researches with 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.250
 wit for authors 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.340
 I even think I never practiced 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.230
 both a book camera who is this and why 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.180
 score means to do the rotation 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.250
 level that does not want you to pick up and 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.310
 put her to say that was me 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.050
 This sentence later and that's what I did is 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.660
 an equivalent of you picking up the brand 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.090
 text and bookmarking is so difficult 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.870
 The lapse you do not like the athlete I'm 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.480
 talking too much 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.250
 I said that they are but not a port in the 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.440
 kindle 2 who does not know Brazil yet 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.630
 Then if we do the following let's talk. 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.490
 now ask question galera record 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.350
 When are you going to release the book here? 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.570
 Brazil the last information I saw 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.880
 here this is that in June the barcelona 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.070

 finish a book without realizing and is 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.210
 immensely satisfied even though neither 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.890
 all are roses and more importantly 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.380
 still the same that made me think about 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.880
 various conditions both mine and 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:48.080
 other people 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.880
 then it will take five of the river z now so 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.800
