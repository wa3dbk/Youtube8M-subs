about lying right here on the internet
and<00:00:08.069> today's<00:00:08.460> question<00:00:09.000> was<00:00:09.510> sent<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.050> from

Sandy from Manhattan who asks about
sulfites<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.519> wine<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.870> they<00:00:16.199> bad<00:00:17.190> for

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
sulfites in wine and are they bad for

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
sulfites in wine and are they bad for
your<00:00:17.640> health<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:20.310> hear<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.420> about<00:00:21.449> sulfides

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
your health I hear a lot about sulfides

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.029 
your health I hear a lot about sulfides
and<00:00:22.350> people<00:00:22.680> asked<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.150> sulfite<00:00:24.150> free<00:00:24.180> wines

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
and people asked for sulfite free wines

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.349 
and people asked for sulfite free wines
but<00:00:26.039> they're<00:00:26.490> very<00:00:26.750> very<00:00:27.750> rare<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
but they're very very rare I think I you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
but they're very very rare I think I you
can<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.810> any<00:00:30.929> wine<00:00:31.260> store<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.430> had

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
can go to any wine store and if they had

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
can go to any wine store and if they had
a<00:00:32.550> thousand<00:00:33.000> bottles<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.540> sure<00:00:33.809> maybe<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.410> or

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
a thousand bottles I'm sure maybe one or

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.319 
a thousand bottles I'm sure maybe one or
two<00:00:34.800> might<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.149> sulfites<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.649> but

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
two might not have sulfites in them but

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.130 
two might not have sulfites in them but
sulfites<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> specifically<00:00:41.480> sulfur<00:00:42.480> dioxide

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
sulfites and specifically sulfur dioxide

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.220 
sulfites and specifically sulfur dioxide
which<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.469> commonly<00:00:43.980> used<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.489> wine<00:00:45.200> as<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
which is commonly used in wine as a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.840 
which is commonly used in wine as a
preservative<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.940> helps<00:00:48.800> wine<00:00:49.850> from

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
preservative and it helps wine from

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720 
preservative and it helps wine from
spoiling<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:52.860> helps<00:00:53.190> wine<00:00:53.399> from

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
spoiling it helps wine from

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
spoiling it helps wine from
discoloration<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.050> prevents<00:00:55.649> bacterial

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
discoloration it prevents bacterial

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.439 
discoloration it prevents bacterial
growth<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:58.070> prevents<00:00:59.070> further

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
growth and it prevents further

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.609 
growth and it prevents further
fermentation<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:02.930> sulfites<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
fermentation so sulfites and I'm just

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
fermentation so sulfites and I'm just
looking<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> bottle<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.240> says

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
looking at a bottle here and it says

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
looking at a bottle here and it says
containing<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> sulfides<00:01:09.380> somewhere<00:01:11.210> but

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
containing the sulfides somewhere but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350 
containing the sulfides somewhere but
it's<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.260> important<00:01:13.680> part<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.360> creating

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's it's an important part of creating

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
it's it's an important part of creating
one<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.590> yes<00:01:16.920> contains<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.790> French

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
one and yes contains it's in French

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.960 
one and yes contains it's in French
that's<00:01:18.240> why<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> didn't<00:01:18.840> understand<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:20.189> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that's why I didn't understand all this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.679 
that's why I didn't understand all this
so<00:01:21.299> eat<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.430> virtually<00:01:23.820> everyone<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so eat it's in virtually everyone that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.570 
so eat it's in virtually everyone that
you<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.220> encounter

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you think that you you will encounter

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140 
you think that you you will encounter
today<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.600> again<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.409> preserve<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
today and again it's to preserve it to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.990 
today and again it's to preserve it to
prevent<00:01:30.479> discoloration<00:01:30.840> further

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
prevent discoloration further

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
prevent discoloration further
fermentation<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:34.170> prevent<00:01:34.500> bacterial

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
fermentation and to prevent bacterial

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.319 
fermentation and to prevent bacterial
growth<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:37.400> sulfites<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> fact<00:01:39.119> a
