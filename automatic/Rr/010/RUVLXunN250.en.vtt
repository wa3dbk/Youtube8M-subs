00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 It is Hi everyone and convenient it is in August of 2013 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.269
 Here's a video that says emobile or wimax is better 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.320
 I gave it and I saw it in various people 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.020
 It Is I EMOBILE is a later one year three months from there 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.400
 Merge with WILLCOM Y Mobile such mark 8 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.190
 I'm involved on January 1st , but I've been under Softbank's umbrella though 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.450
 I Which is good one year and three months later it is actually Well Ymobile and wimax 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.210
 It is to say 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:40.010
 This time I would like to talk about this and now is the time with that mobile 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.809
 wimax I mean which is better 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.359
 That's right You compare whether it is actually It is from November 1 of this month 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.899
 ymr 's temper corresponding to the plan called pocket wifi + 300 now 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.210
 like this 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.539
 zt is is directed to a method which is in the plan but I'm not only here models 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.030
 Ne 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:05.339
 It is normal for two years It is one month Naan is limited 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 Announced of it is to say and eliminating the ones that there is than of limitation chief god 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.750
 Here's a less stable card for wimax 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.820
 Although the say slow down the speed I was talking about you now videos before 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 there is no basically is in hasty restrictions two years with respect to wimax 2+ 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 The condition is that there is no limit for the condition max too much. 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.500
 Two Ymobile and wimax Tteyuu lined up in it is a service basis that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 became 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 Now I am here from this August This is a rare thing called nab 11 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.960
 Make a contract with wimax 2+ and use it 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.590
 I think I'm feeling say still feel that with honesty but I have the room becomes weak 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.090
 If it is wimax 's solution , it will be quite easy to connect 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.799
 Brothel + is but I do not to say I switched to it is almost wimax 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.830
 I also felt that the needle of Tenma was bad when I went indoors 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.990
 In so 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:07.130
 But it was sister needle era Tteyuu strong high-end look six questions in terms of the strength of the path 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.849
 Because I had such an impression, I thought it would be a bit of a change 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.480
 That's why I also went to the shop and asked 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.340
 In fact, it's true that the limit of giga is real 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 It is actually a distress be only no 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.620
 Mr. Ando I think it 's a story that I say what you say it is 305 z t type 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.849
 Care if there Though I LCD screen is attached do this is it is when the government is facing the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.330
 I Se it's likely comes out of Tteyuu I was over gain it is up to it now 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:44.030
 If you pay 500 yen for 500 mechanical items, how to unlock that button 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:48.170
 Wash and is released it is the speed limit do You're So button was Rutteyuu mechanism 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.740
 Even if I push it, I won't spend 500 yen . It's free for 2 years. 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 What this also it's a thing that can be used 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.319
 If you do not work Tteyuu be released once by pressing It is 11 on their own that button and Pochitsu 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.139
 I don't think so 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:08.760
 It 's totally like wimax on the top You 're not using it forever and unlimited 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:14.670
 Nara two because the mind it takes this product it is every time a 500 eyes from where there is only a 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.610
 At the terminal , I 'll push it down and open it once and use it endlessly for free 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 Seems to be able to 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.890
 I still got a little tension down I pressed a point to return 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 I have to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.980
 I this I'd raised a little Toka-in static grams Toka after Twitter before 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 Although we use wimax 2+ as a normalator, though 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.990
 Last year and or use a flexible mind it is a little'll you have financed all Well for one week me this 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.260
 The number is pretty damn to Toka want to give some say selfish 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.010
 See you then 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.350
 If you use it like that, after all 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 Every time I thought that the 500th male was quite annoying to the sound 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.640
 The tension has dropped a little, and one more thing 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.070
 Though it is what is called band limitation 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:08.620
 It is a specific period for people who are using sushi over the city ​​council in 3 days 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:10.340
 The control of that breath will no longer have the limit of 7 gigs. 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.890
 It does not wind itself 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 That is to say, for those who use a lot of data night other than its 7 gig limit 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.760
 I 'm going to limit in the end because the part of the restriction that I feel in one day is stuck in 3 days 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.360
 right 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:35.669
 But I know I feel it 's virtually unlimited say why unlimited Hey Hey 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:41.699
 It feels like it's actually free for mobile phones, but there are many conditions in the first place, so 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.979
 I found that it wasn't completely unlimited, so I just mentioned the bandwidth limit I mentioned earlier 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.289
 It is in on also is Somehow net relates 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.350
 There was an article saying that 1 gig was gone for 3 days, but this was before 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:56.020
 In the shock of mobile 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.740
 Once I heard Is that true I'd seen it is the body brother in that sort of my net 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.310
 Yea 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.290
 Nde had been said I heard you were Nette 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.800
 It does n't change whether it is a little true yet, so when you make a contract 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:13.110
 It is a matter responsibility if I have the confirmation of the firm 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.200
 I think it would be nice if you could make a contract, so it's just like I said that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.300
 It is the same as in August 2013 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.229
 If you use Ymobile, that wimax 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:28.449
 Area dwelling where electric wave of vinegar + is hard to enter 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:34.539
 Your respect towards snow If I Is not a little of it communication night it says take to justice after 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:38.280
 I think it's a recommendation, but like me a lot use more and no limit 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.320
 Is more of it is those who say you want to use after all wimax 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.970
 2014 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.350
 As of November , wimax does not apply to such a long term 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.390
 I think 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:55.190
 Certainly wimax 2+ is a little radio wave compared to m file 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:58.729
 Guess I did you say and I that even though I'm weak to touch in the room 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:04.879
 I put that router at the window 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:06.259
 There is no problem at all in the speed. You can use it enough because it is not the speed that feels like a space 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.189
 It feels like 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:16.370
 At the same time, the last 3 years to talk is by max + 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:18.720
 7 giga of limitation is not the in and the main municipal district from April 2015 be the band-limited exits 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:25.230
 May not Tsu to say rumor is but I'm out 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:30.450
 Since the base station is taking over from now phrase number probably not do but that part is also not absolute 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.410
 So it may therefore feel that wonder if not it is capacity to say I want to use a lot 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.860
 If 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.360
 I think the sprouting kana say of wimax 2+ 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.990
 The model that did the actual carrier aggregation is out there at least 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.330
 Also 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:47.389
 The 305 zt is a riders up to 165 mbps, isn't it? 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.150
 I still have fairways but wimax is not out 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:53.880
 Down to a maximum of 220 mbps and the model that corresponds to the carrier aggregation is Dell 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.950
 Out and Iuko 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.610
 And day is a bit or say that wimax 2+ will be faster than mobile 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.930
 To be 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.930
 It will be in the Wei Yan time 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.810
 tni 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.810
 me 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.910
 Kubo tan 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.910
 me 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.680
 can you do
