got the original radio in the truck
no<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.170> come<00:01:59.680> what<00:01:59.830> I<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.160> see<00:02:00.340> Mike<00:02:00.580> when<00:02:00.760> he

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
no I come what I can see Mike when he

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.300 
no I come what I can see Mike when he
received<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.300> car<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:02.140> came<00:02:02.530> with<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:02.950> there

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
received the car it came with that there

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.850 
received the car it came with that there
was<00:02:03.430> an<00:02:03.580> AM<00:02:03.880> radio<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.780> back<00:02:04.990> gotcha

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
was an AM radio in the back gotcha

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.500 
was an AM radio in the back gotcha
so<00:02:06.040> I'm<00:02:06.160> assuming<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.910> previous<00:02:07.300> owner

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
so I'm assuming that the previous owner

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.389 
so I'm assuming that the previous owner
swapped<00:02:07.869> them<00:02:08.080> out<00:02:08.200> that's<00:02:09.040> what<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.250> would

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
swapped them out that's what I would

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.470 
swapped them out that's what I would
think<00:02:09.520> too<00:02:10.260> -<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.470> real<00:02:11.709> nice<00:02:12.480> definitely

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
think too - is real nice definitely

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:36.110 
think too - is real nice definitely
looks<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.930> 37<00:02:14.590> mile<00:02:15.370> car

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.530
