water but for salt while you're gonna

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.620 
water but for salt while you're gonna
need<00:02:24.530> two<00:02:24.710> teaspoons<00:02:25.430> make<00:02:26.360> sure<00:02:26.540> you

is I usually make 16 ounces and I've put
I<00:02:36.400> put<00:02:37.400> 4<00:02:38.180> ounces<00:02:38.570> every<00:02:39.230> time<00:02:39.530> make<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.740> and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
I put 4 ounces every time make it and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.340 
I put 4 ounces every time make it and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
you go to the cage which they need this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.990 
you go to the cage which they need this
this<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.990> important<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:46.190> spray<00:02:46.790> down<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
this is important you spray down the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.790 
this is important you spray down the
cage<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.500> would<00:02:54.770> be

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
cage just like this this this would be

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.740 
cage just like this this this would be
fresh<00:02:55.310> water<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.970> going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.270> be<00:02:56.330> fresh

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
fresh water this is going to be fresh

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.520 
fresh water this is going to be fresh
water<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.760> say<00:02:58.760> straight<00:02:59.120> down<00:02:59.330> just

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.840 

like<00:03:03.530> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
like that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.140 
like that
it'd<00:03:05.950> probably<00:03:06.950> get<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.370> six<00:03:07.970> or<00:03:08.120> seven

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
it'd probably get like six or seven

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.900 
it'd probably get like six or seven
squirts<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.810> there<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.370> put<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> piece<00:03:10.880> of

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
squirts in there and put a piece of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.060 
squirts in there and put a piece of
plexiglass<00:03:11.230> over<00:03:12.230> top<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.680> would<00:03:12.800> show<00:03:13.040> you

plexiglass over top and I would show you

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.560 
plexiglass over top and I would show you
how<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.340> make<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:14.080> cage<00:03:15.080> form<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:16.160> don't<00:03:16.570> so

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570
