00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.220
 hello to all guys with currency 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.880
 apply the partner as usual not 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.180
 can never miss and after that I go to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.800
 draw a triangular subspecies 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
 at the end of the eye trying to be 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.260
 quite accurate with the black pencil in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.730
 way to make a base for 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.100
 then they will argue 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.980
 and as you see I try to be enough 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.290
 I do not go further than 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.360
 those with a pencil because soon 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.130
 I'm going to smoke it with a small brush e 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.130
 so I will already bring my love 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 command of the sea ​​with a small brush 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.350
 flat but you can also do it with the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.399
 fingers if you want and raise a little veins up 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.399
 nature of black 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.409
 now I take off which has a very black 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.120
 very beautiful glitter 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.800
 which gives a wonderful almost wet effect 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.980
 and I'm going to stake him over black 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.480
 I'm not going to drag but appreciate in 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.270
 so that twitter 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.370
 they all remain and not in a 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.500
 they fall in short so as to have the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.930
 maximum effect of the accounts 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.030
 then I sell their bill high e 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.470
 I'm going to apply it over the fold 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 of the eye so as to create my own 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.720
 gradient towards the eyebrow 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 a clean panel then I go to digest 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.400
 my colored shade and then apply 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.349
 also a bit of hong shimmer under the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.810
 fold so as to still lighten the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.000
 nuance then I take the yellow that is 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.950
 really a lot more become and I apply it 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.379
 we choose the inside of the eye 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.379
 going to blend it well with black 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.780
 now I pick up the yellow I apply it as 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.230
 see below the line I made 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 first to create a subspecies 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.570
 of blocked even though that was not the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.700
 the intent in short, I just wanted to 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.700
 resume yellow in the inner corner 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.320
 then with a cat's tongue brush 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.010
 I'm always going to get the black again 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.660
 always off from the palette of murat and I go 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.640
 to apply them in this way as you see 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.890
 so perfectly entrust to create one 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.670
 double line at the end of the eye in 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.830
 worst way than steam 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.840
 then I apply the pencil of nam the bomb i 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.690
 black cats stupendous my city 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.270
 favorite and or shaded and black under the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.130
 so rhyme because I don't think I 'll see 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.200
 if I can do it with 8 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.250
 however, as you can see, he wants to offer 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.990
 anyway 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.490
 part of dark circles so that 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.490
 it's not too heavy 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.580
 now I take from the woolmen stand up there is 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.540
 inside the pool 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.300
 one of the palette that is really 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.320
 I usually hate these liners 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.820
 commits but this I must say that it is 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.730
 fantastic Florentine that ever has me 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.540
 seen never tried at a fantastic black 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.410
 with a wonderful shy 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.270
 I draw eyeliner sinkholes so much 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.970
 simple in short, there was no skin 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.530
 too long I make a line enough 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.920
 however slim the attachment of the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.050
 eyelashes and I do my usual tongue 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.060
 at the inner corner then I apply 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.130
 plenty of mascara before applying 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.400
 fake eyelashes this is always here 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.400
 in the west 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.890
 and then here applied a fake monkey 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.890
 these are for relaxation 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.460
 is 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.170
 and then I go to apply on the tricolor ha 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.170
 launched as 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.590
 the blush e.on shimmer like 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.500
 then for the lips decided to stay on a 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.510
 color news as the eyes are 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.640
 good 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.190
 is this here is a lip pencil of 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.800
 sciacca that really has a flesh-colored color 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.800
 very nice but now I do n't know 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.600
 as my usual I go to redefine the 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.450
 outer part of the lips so that 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.580
 they also look a little bit more than that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.060
 defined a little bulky type and 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.060
 kills 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.020
 nothing this is the look is over 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.699
 I hope that 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.949
 square could know with a comment 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.940
 but all that remains is to greet you and maybe a 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.940
 big step hi all guys
