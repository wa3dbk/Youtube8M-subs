00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 healthy everyone today finally decided 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.319
 write shkolota clean they continue 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.530
 passing the campaign for why so me 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 a hundred times asked to show 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.660
 any standard formulations 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 standard tactics standard situation 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.260
 when you advance here are the first stars 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.689
 to 10 that's exactly what i want to show today 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.699
 This is a game with a globalka with auto search playing 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.670
 against Italian from clan arditi under 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.000
 no fat my standard composition 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 which I use 9 out of 10 battles 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 when we are his general there is no 7 stars then 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.250
 there is when the battle goes to those who do not know 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.110
 up to 4 to 4 stars you play at 5000 to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.660
 seven stars you play at 10,000 after 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.309
 seven stars play them 14,000 and here's the game 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.110
 on 10,000 and almost always spend 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 so general 5 red bears 4th river 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 and infantry 2nd riccati plus to surrender 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.750
 one militia with spears on this card 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 on a wide spacious map I immediately 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.500
 respected one squad right quick 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.640
 grab a peasant house which will give 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.439
 me speed and endurance 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.619
 this getting modest is moving on 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.060
 center will project your workshop 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 I prefer to divide the infantry into two 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.540
 small groups that is naturally in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 1 3 in the other two squads I have 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 It turned out that in this situation I still 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 all the infantry villas left flank and how are you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.369
 see we concentrate big enough 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.229
 all forces on the left flank 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.610
 here on 3 cavalry here my whole 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.380
 strong infantry i riccati 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.020
 And now I'll start to drag 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609
 linear infantry 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.380
 but against me playing the composition more or less 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.210
 a cavalry like him on the left 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.859
 flank he has a whole army more 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.110
 pumped plus but are there any squad 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.490
 which I meanwhile began to rock me 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.460
 this general in which part of whom I 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.990
 literally this week and these are the numbers 16 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 May 15 and all the veterans, I also dare 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.149
 because they were crooked me 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 swayed at all they changed and 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.560
 In general, I am against the river 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.329
 fourth level and 6 polar bears 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.890
 stock french marines 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.450
 level five plus his personal 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.340
 distances are the biggest problems 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.140
 for me and for me it was necessary to find 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.329
 the way portraits sow the marines with 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.429
 counter and not let her shoot 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.130
 on interesting frags on infantry with him 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.140
 time two three 4 5 ward he has but 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.360
 she's gone to level 4 here 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.840
 plus 1 stock + market ie money 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.010
 he spent much more on infantry and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.440
 roughly my whole infantry plus two 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 my good spears for about 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.829
 equals all of his infantry when filled 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 scott 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.420
 cavalry he has 3 against my four 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.129
 but due to the fact that they have 90 on their own 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.040
 cheaper so i have fewer stars not about 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.230
 a dozen was silver then this difference in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.459
 money I could withdraw as early as 1 4 from 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.750
 cavalry and additionally squad 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.730
 spear militia 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.560
 here we are quietly standing opposite each other 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.290
 friend and in the meantime I may have taken the right 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.540
 plug-in workshop and peasant house and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.959
 looking for a couple of squads on the right flank 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.870
 have my 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.280
 1 1 and rivers runoff after receipt 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 how many on the left as I have 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 said concentrate shock infantry 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 force here it is worth my main problem 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.260
 here's the french marines 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.530
 volley which basically this whole fight 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.940
 the situation will begin standard as in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.410
 any battle you need to catch the enemy 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.599
 maneuvers use your strengths 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.000
 sides and here I see that he is two 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.769
 their cavalry a good 4 level pavel 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.150
 right flank and this moment in order 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.829
 so that I can attack with nonetheless 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.660
 I admit but not a mistake here in another way 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.900
 you canâ€™t play it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.799
 advantages have a distance of 150 and 125 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.900
 so I had to go back under 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.250
 the first volley and then you could even 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.890
 do it a little faster i rushed 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.050
 Kovalevich 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 here I also admit a few 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.040
 mistakes all the same for a long time did not play here 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.690
 see for to go out to anyone not here 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.280
 I want and the third squad is worth it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.350
 also beat them to this Marine heating 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.819
 faster cut plus me drive up 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.040
 a general who naturally gives a buff on 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.500
 morality and stick in the pistol 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.959
 and I have through the backs of my answers right 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.700
 in a straight stupa run my I riccati alone 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.130
 of them also in the first level here a 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 I remembered the detachment, I brought the rivers into battle 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.070
 I'm doing everything right I finish them on 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.989
 french marines 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.020
 he naturally shabby him too 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.040
 general, everything starts skirmish 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.870
 I have two infantry here 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.620
 ranged you melee and 3 cavalry 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.840
 he has three cavalry marine here 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.220
 french maritime bear and 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.780
 spear Valeria lighthouse here for some reason too 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.040
 No, for some reason the trooper was pouring 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.840
 because she was either a water drain 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.250
 Generally child and he was sixth 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.739
 the level of even the fact that he stood still 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.680
 and attacked and got an onslaught bonus i 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.510
 this ayat almost broke zero on 2 May you 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.180
 how many mixed up the whole line in the near 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.500
 in the meantime, he drove up to 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.140
 malaria which is again older 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.850
 level finishes my colleagues plus mine 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.430
 cavalry fought with the score and the infantry too 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.450
 I suffered losses here I could 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.729
 neutralize so that at this moment 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.780
 hurried general immediately deployed 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.120
 bears to the rescue 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.560
 and I drag have boats come out here 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.360
 center on continues to press red 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.770
 bears and see the moment that he is his again 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.930
 displacements that retreats again 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.789
 I catch his reserve cavalry squad 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.500
 they immediately run course near 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.259
 spears and moves my other people 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.490
 the infantry became visible had its mouth 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.530
 did not have time to accommodate him 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 early or keep the ruler behind 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.910
 but in general, this squad and generation 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.729
 delayed long enough to or 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.289
 to drink here he had known plus 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.919
 general rearrange my I riccati 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.009
 second squad 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.810
 to the point that they ran into the battlefield but I 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.669
 take advantage of the fact that he renounced killed 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.310
 one detachment of red bears has 4 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.530
 level quietly here from everything 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.570
 Valery figured out hands did not work well 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.389
 the situation is that he has three linear squads 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.120
 infantry 4 4 and 4 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.740
 and I have all the dojo to give more precisely two 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.130
 the gold of this will come from the minimap of wine 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.810
 that red is not mine, I will not keep you 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.000
 now nobody i have neutralized and 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.680
 I should calmly put on such 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.250
 situation is important not to rush grab 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.009
 all dojo 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.509
 surround and do not play to the right nowhere 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.310
 take your time work for you 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.110
 here and I spend a few will pay 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.539
 magnitude forward dragged not lost on 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.330
 level ground remained with him 3 infantry 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:53.229
 plus general not once two three 4 5 move and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.930
 plus spear one almost whole and cavalry 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.120
 cavalry zanykal into the forest and kept it 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.940
 last to victory here is such 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.190
 the situation is that you see his glorious my 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.419
 Well position in general side substituted 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.780
 squad here so naturally 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.729
 actively thank heaven the edges here i 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.260
 leave with the forest is not really like 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.300
 recommended to do and if skirmish 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.650
 it is likely that he will 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.360
 red in the form here and would benefit from the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.570
 superiority due to the fact that 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.220
 me he's alive but I'm here in my dull 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.590
 a detachment came to attack run 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.360
 forward and not only my long- range 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.420
 will break the distance perfectly 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.610
 understand that 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.470
 as soon as valerie rolls killed him 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.360
 chance of battle fought there will be no 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.770
 still, I was holding on to the cavalier 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.570
 because remember how here on the street 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.800
 there is another squad who thinks useful 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.520
 forward she will get the hall when she dies 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.790
 the cumulative impact on morale in 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.260
 shootout I'm pushing me riccati 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.570
 made it so red in the form here 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.360
 this white flag this squad is slowly 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.650
 keep cleaning apparently said he 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.520
 could business win but apparently he 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.990
 too pushed forward and angry because 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.400
 that here you are nice to deliver here 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.830
 just now you are cool not to delay 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.740
 I'm hiding too cavalry back I 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.630
 don't wanna lose i play yes right and in 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.160
 principle fight drag that is 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.690
 it turned out that his strong flank 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.870
 he had three good colleagues plus 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.510
 Marines I could successfully well quite exemplary 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.520
 prato forge but nevertheless could 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.770
 lure out of him the first second hall afterwards 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.750
 quietly break into his cavalry in 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.530
 him while the infusion at the site of the prius then 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.570
 my ran 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.610
 I riccati while he stood still at the expense of 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.170
 of this i in the left of the fund kneaded he was 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.730
 forced to retreat there was natural 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.740
 will coordinate steel actions 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.270
 armies retreat on this maneuver this a 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.310
 on the right cut one squad under zero 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.440
 without losing anyone and quietly fork 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.770
 there were advantages; the main mistakes were 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.210
 then he began to play the second number he 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.120
 allowed me to grab give more and 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.470
 allowed to impose his style of play in 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.150
 further plans I have to write 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.400
 naturally continuation of companies for from 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.320

 more school issues so clean and mine 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.080
