even<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> worry<00:01:30.180> about<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:31.700> because

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
even going to worry about it because

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.770 
even going to worry about it because
it's<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:34.400> truck<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.420> good<00:01:36.570> enough

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

for me

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.820 
for me

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
you can kind of see some of the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.550 
you can kind of see some of the
batteries<00:01:41.580> as<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.720> before<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.350> even

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
batteries as it was before I even

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
batteries as it was before I even
painted<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.060> truck<00:01:45.420> bed<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.930> could

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
painted it here in the truck bed I could

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
painted it here in the truck bed I could
probably<00:01:46.680> paint<00:01:46.980> this<00:01:47.160> truck<00:01:47.430> bed<00:01:47.670> too<00:01:47.940> but<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
probably paint this truck bed too but I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.000 
probably paint this truck bed too but I
just<00:01:48.510> haven't<00:01:48.870> gotten<00:01:49.110> around<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> yet

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010

you've got a good hold on it you just

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.759 
you've got a good hold on it you just
let<00:03:41.430> go<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.909> there<00:03:42.689> you<00:03:42.870> go<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.230> bondo

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
let go and there you go you can bondo

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.470 
let go and there you go you can bondo
around<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> kind<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.760> smooth<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.269> the

around it to kind of smooth out the
edges<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.349> obviously<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.190> didn't<00:03:47.579> but<00:03:50.060> then

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
edges but obviously I didn't but then

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.420 
edges but obviously I didn't but then
you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.329> paint<00:03:51.720> right<00:03:51.930> over<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.500> showed<00:03:53.310> you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
you can paint right over it I showed you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.530 
you can paint right over it I showed you
all<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.639> parts<00:03:53.819> you're<00:03:53.970> going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> need<00:03:54.329> it's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
all the parts you're going to need it's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.960 
all the parts you're going to need it's
pretty<00:03:54.840> cheap<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.919> can<00:03:56.069> get<00:03:56.250> cheaper<00:03:56.609> cutters

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
pretty cheap you can get cheaper cutters

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.420 
pretty cheap you can get cheaper cutters
and<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:58.199> all<00:03:58.379> depends<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.859> how<00:03:58.980> many<00:03:59.040> patch

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
and it all depends on how many patch

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.360 
and it all depends on how many patch
holes<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.030> need<00:04:00.560> for<00:04:01.560> how<00:04:01.709> many<00:04:01.769> for<00:04:02.159> how<00:04:02.220> big

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
holes you need for how many for how big

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.280 
holes you need for how many for how big
of<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.549> sheet<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:02.849> galvanized<00:04:03.840> steel<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.230> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
of a sheet of galvanized steel that you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.069 
of a sheet of galvanized steel that you
need<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.829> how<00:04:05.400> big<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.760> tube<00:04:06.359> of<00:04:06.599> bondo

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
need and how big of a tube of bondo

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.439 
need and how big of a tube of bondo
you'll<00:04:07.379> need<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.859> adhesive<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.970> there's<00:04:09.359> a
