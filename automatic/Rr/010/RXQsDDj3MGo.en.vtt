master how does an act to make that
impact<00:00:58.289> well<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> series<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> things<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
impact well a series of things really I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
impact well a series of things really I
think<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.500> first<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.879> actor<00:01:03.239> has

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
think one the first is that an actor has

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
think one the first is that an actor has
a<00:01:03.449> vision<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.989> themselves<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.589> visual<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a vision for themselves a visual to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
a vision for themselves a visual to
their<00:01:05.189> career<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:06.030> fall<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.479> love<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
their career they fall in love with the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
their career they fall in love with the
idea<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> career<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:09.270> think

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
idea of that kind of career and I think

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
idea of that kind of career and I think
that's<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.020> essential<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.130> hold

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's really essential for them to hold

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
that's really essential for them to hold
on<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.820> their<00:01:12.180> uniqueness<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.860> they

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on to that their uniqueness of what they

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.950 
on to that their uniqueness of what they
they<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.240> themselves<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.930> they

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
they see for themselves and what they

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.510 
they see for themselves and what they
identify<00:01:16.680> with

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.980 

to<00:01:22.520> not<00:01:22.700> prepare<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.329> screen<00:01:23.570> test<00:01:23.810> in

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
to not prepare the screen test in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.440 
to not prepare the screen test in
concrete<00:01:24.500> which<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.119> way<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.270> do

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
concrete which is this is the way I do

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.530 
concrete which is this is the way I do
it<00:01:26.689> oh<00:01:26.930> my<00:01:27.170> god<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.409> hope<00:01:27.619> I<00:01:27.770> get<00:01:27.950> through<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.310> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
it oh my god I hope I get through it and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.660 
it oh my god I hope I get through it and
then<00:01:29.540> it's<00:01:29.720> done<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.159> prepare<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.610> in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
then it's done so not to prepare it in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.969 
then it's done so not to prepare it in
concrete<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.630> if<00:01:32.780> we've<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.439> director

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
concrete so that if we've a director

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.859 
concrete so that if we've a director
gives<00:01:34.130> them<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.369> direction<00:01:34.729> they're<00:01:35.450> actually

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
gives them a direction they're actually

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.609 
gives them a direction they're actually
able<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:36.380> hear<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:36.950> act<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:39.020> think

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
able to hear it and act on it I think

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.120 
able to hear it and act on it I think
that's<00:01:39.860> very<00:01:40.299> important<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:42.140> be<00:01:42.530> aware<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that's very important to be aware of the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.070 
that's very important to be aware of the
camera<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.580> think<00:01:43.850> people<00:01:44.030> can<00:01:44.299> do<00:01:44.450> three<00:01:44.840> years

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
camera I think people can do three years

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.160 
camera I think people can do three years
of<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.289> drama<00:01:45.530> course<00:01:45.920> or<00:01:46.189> studying<00:01:47.149> drama<00:01:47.360> but

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
of a drama course or studying drama but

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.109 
of a drama course or studying drama but
unless<00:01:48.439> they<00:01:48.710> become<00:01:49.130> familiar<00:01:49.909> with<00:01:50.000> a

unless they become familiar with a

unless they become familiar with a
camera<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.810> how<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:51.770> work<00:01:52.069> with<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> camera

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
camera and how to work with a camera

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.940 
camera and how to work with a camera
that<00:01:52.940> can<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> bit<00:01:54.110> challenging<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:54.830> them

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that can be a bit challenging for them

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.260 
that can be a bit challenging for them
they<00:01:55.069> can<00:01:55.250> take<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.459> little<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.819> adjustment

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
they can take a little bit of adjustment

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.859 
they can take a little bit of adjustment
time<00:01:57.009> now<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.640> physical<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.179> very<00:01:59.360> important

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
time now the physical is very important

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.220 

I<00:03:12.460> believe<00:03:13.460> acting<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.120> choosing<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.020> be<00:03:15.140> an

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
I believe acting and choosing to be an

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.340 
I believe acting and choosing to be an
actor<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> noble<00:03:16.100> profession<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.930> as<00:03:17.930> we

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
actor is a noble profession and as we

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.780 
actor is a noble profession and as we
can<00:03:18.560> see<00:03:18.770> from<00:03:18.800> people<00:03:19.220> like<00:03:19.310> Marilyn<00:03:19.760> Monroe

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
can see from people like Marilyn Monroe

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.020 
can see from people like Marilyn Monroe
and<00:03:20.330> Humphrey<00:03:20.690> Bogart<00:03:21.370> many<00:03:22.370> actors<00:03:22.670> Charlie

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
and Humphrey Bogart many actors Charlie

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.450 
and Humphrey Bogart many actors Charlie
Chaplin<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.140> goes<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.560> these<00:03:25.250> are

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
Chaplin and so it goes on these are

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.670 
Chaplin and so it goes on these are
people<00:03:25.730> who<00:03:25.760> had<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> dream<00:03:26.510> they<00:03:27.020> had<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> vision

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
people who had a dream they had a vision

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.890 
people who had a dream they had a vision
and<00:03:27.830> they<00:03:28.010> had<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> dream<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.390> vision<00:03:29.600> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and they had a dream and that vision and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.960 
and they had a dream and that vision and
dream<00:03:30.020> is<00:03:30.320> transcended<00:03:31.010> time<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.400> space<00:03:31.610> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
dream is transcended time and space and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.510 
dream is transcended time and space and
so<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> think<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.230> more<00:03:33.380> powerful<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.160> dream

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
so I think the more powerful you dream

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.670 
so I think the more powerful you dream
the<00:03:35.030> more<00:03:35.240> powerful<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.900> magnitude<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.560> you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
the more powerful the magnitude of you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.130 
the more powerful the magnitude of you
reach<00:03:36.920> across<00:03:37.280> time<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.670> space<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.360> and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
reach across time and space and and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.290 
reach across time and space and and
we're<00:03:39.830> seeing<00:03:40.100> young<00:03:40.250> people<00:03:40.310> inspired<00:03:41.060> by

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
we're seeing young people inspired by

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.140 
we're seeing young people inspired by
those<00:03:41.450> actors<00:03:41.870> now<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:42.890> can<00:03:43.520> we<00:03:43.640> see<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.060> we

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
those actors now so can we see that we

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.790 
those actors now so can we see that we
can<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.480> an<00:03:44.570> immortal<00:03:45.050> life<00:03:45.230> as<00:03:45.380> an<00:03:45.500> after

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
can have an immortal life as an after

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.620 
can have an immortal life as an after
and<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.430> believe<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.730> all<00:03:46.970> actors<00:03:47.360> are

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
and I believe that all actors are

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.540 
and I believe that all actors are
teachers<00:03:48.110> reflecting<00:03:48.770> back<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.040> an<00:03:49.280> audience

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
teachers reflecting back to an audience

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.220 
teachers reflecting back to an audience
aspects<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.300> themselves

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.290
