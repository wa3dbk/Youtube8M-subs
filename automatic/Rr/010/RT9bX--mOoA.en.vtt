00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
or six thousand calories it's pretty

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.670 
or six thousand calories it's pretty
hard<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> protocol<00:01:10.650> for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
hard because the protocol for

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
hard because the protocol for
intermittent<00:01:11.159> fasting<00:01:11.400> asks<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> eat

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
intermittent fasting asks for you to eat

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
intermittent fasting asks for you to eat
for<00:01:13.080> eight<00:01:13.260> hours<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.340> fast<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.939> 16

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
for eight hours and then fast for 16

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
for eight hours and then fast for 16
hours<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.439> those

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
hours so you have to get all those

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
hours so you have to get all those
calories<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.000> 5<00:01:18.240> or

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
calories in for me that would be 5 or

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
calories in for me that would be 5 or
6,000<00:01:18.869> calories<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.320> eight<00:01:19.590> hours<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.310> have

6,000 calories in eight hours I have

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.740 
6,000 calories in eight hours I have
done<00:01:20.729> intermittent<00:01:21.119> fasting<00:01:21.240> though<00:01:21.600> before

done intermittent fasting though before

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
done intermittent fasting though before
it<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.560> works<00:01:22.799> pretty<00:01:23.009> well<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.580> far<00:01:23.820> as

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it and it works pretty well as far as

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
it and it works pretty well as far as
keeping<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.020> fat<00:01:25.259> gain<00:01:25.610> minimal<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.759> you're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
keeping the fat gain minimal when you're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
keeping the fat gain minimal when you're
bulking<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.990> helps<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.950> you're

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
bulking or it really helps when you're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
bulking or it really helps when you're
cutting<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.880> retain<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.420> muscle<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:30.930> lose
