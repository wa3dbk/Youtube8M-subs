00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
let's go over the actual figure so as

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.849 
let's go over the actual figure so as
you<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.609> see<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:53.049> middle<00:01:53.409> leg<00:01:53.590> right<00:01:53.829> here

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859

other astronauts that they've made so

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.559 
other astronauts that they've made so
far<00:01:58.749> for<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.049> clone<00:01:59.229> resign<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.509> can

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
far for the clone resign but as you can

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.139 
far for the clone resign but as you can
see<00:02:01.749> the<00:02:01.959> middle<00:02:02.439> leg<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.770> writable<00:02:03.149> removable

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
see the middle leg is writable removable

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.849 
see the middle leg is writable removable
I<00:02:04.299> can<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:04.959> plug<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.289> right<00:02:05.319> back<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.740> there

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
I can just plug it right back in there

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.499 
I can just plug it right back in there
if<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.069> want<00:02:06.279> to<00:02:06.429> but<00:02:06.639> I<00:02:06.700> prefer<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.240> keep<00:02:07.389> it

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
if you want to but I prefer to keep it

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.320 
if you want to but I prefer to keep it
out<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.520> pops<00:02:09.700> right<00:02:09.850> in<00:02:10.090> there<00:02:10.209> and

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
out so it just pops right in there and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.970 
out so it just pops right in there and
you<00:02:10.390> know<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.569> can<00:02:10.629> put<00:02:10.810> them<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
you know it can put them in the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.920 
you know it can put them in the
walking<00:02:12.980> position<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.460> guess<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.880> say<00:02:14.090> so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
walking position I guess you can say so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.840 
walking position I guess you can say so
that<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.290> snaps<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.820> course

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that just snaps right out and of course

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.200 
that just snaps right out and of course
on<00:02:17.300> all<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.630> all<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.960> legs<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.620> has<00:02:18.770> wheels

hinge joint and they just go right back
in<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.930> yeah<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.800> closes<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.520> then

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
in there so yeah that closes up and then

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.550 
in there so yeah that closes up and then
there's<00:02:50.150> also<00:02:50.270> one<00:02:50.600> more<00:02:50.660> hatch<00:02:50.990> that<00:02:51.260> opens

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
there's also one more hatch that opens

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
up on the back of the joy which shows a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.010 
up on the back of the joy which shows a
hidden<00:02:55.060> grappling<00:02:56.060> hook<00:02:56.240> type<00:02:56.480> thing<00:02:56.750> so

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
hidden grappling hook type thing so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.450 
hidden grappling hook type thing so
basically<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:57.980> stuck<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.310> there<00:02:58.400> pretty

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
basically it's stuck in there pretty

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.850 
basically it's stuck in there pretty
well<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.030> kind<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.210> hard<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.450> get<00:02:59.630> out<00:02:59.860> but

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
well it's kind of hard to get out but

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.440 
well it's kind of hard to get out but
the<00:03:01.040> whole<00:03:01.190> entire<00:03:01.370> mechanism<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:02.060> controlled

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the whole entire mechanism is controlled

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.330 
the whole entire mechanism is controlled
by<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.630> head<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.560> when<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.770> swivel<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.310> head

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
by the head so when you swivel the head

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.990 
by the head so when you swivel the head
around<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:06.200> cable<00:03:07.100> should<00:03:07.370> come<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.790> but

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
around the cable should come out but

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.080 
around the cable should come out but
it's<00:03:08.210> usually<00:03:08.390> get<00:03:08.720> stuck<00:03:08.960> in<00:03:09.140> there<00:03:09.970> let<00:03:10.970> me

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
it's usually get stuck in there let me

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.810 
it's usually get stuck in there let me
try<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.540> get<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.840> out<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.080> for<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.410> guys

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
try to get it out there for you guys

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.400 
try to get it out there for you guys
it's<00:03:13.820> kind<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.030> hard<00:03:14.270> as<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.570> can<00:03:14.690> notice<00:03:15.080> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's kind of hard as you can notice it

it's kind of hard as you can notice it
just<00:03:15.440> gets<00:03:15.740> stuck<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:17.000> hard

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
just gets stuck in there and it's hard

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.630 
just gets stuck in there and it's hard
to<00:03:17.690> pull<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.930> out<00:03:17.990> so<00:03:18.260> there<00:03:18.410> we<00:03:18.530> go<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.490> as<00:03:19.610> you

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
to pull it out so there we go so as you

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.410 
can see the head swivels when you pull
it<00:03:21.320> out<00:03:21.460> these<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.700> see<00:03:22.910> here<00:03:23.120> it's<00:03:23.240> just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
it out these you can see here it's just

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.390 
it out these you can see here it's just
a<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.750> hook<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.080> string<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.560> if<00:03:25.160> when

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
a little hook on a string and if when
