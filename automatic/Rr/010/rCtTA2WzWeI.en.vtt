00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.069
 hello all yourself hunter and in this video 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.240
 tell you how to grow crystals in 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.609
 apple is hold on co2 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.719
 There are three types of crystals in total. 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.480
 you can grow 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.730
 this quartz is changeable crystal ice crystal 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.709
 written quartz here these three crystals 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.170
 need to crush it can be done 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.270
 in quartz motors either in any 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.620
 friend from another mod for example as a gift 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.530
 the cloister and it was breaking the truth 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.020
 experiment after you get 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.020
 dust of the corresponding crystal and its 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.200
 must be combined with sand and like this 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.490
 and you get two seed units 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.110
 for example to get this here 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.590
 all quartz and lower world need 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.960
 be quartz and lower world sand throw 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.739
 this is all a crafting grid and you end up 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.860
 get the seeds right here i showed up 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.430
 example mutable dust further these seeds 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.980
 you just need to throw all the water 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.829
 the process started they will slowly be 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.760
 grow up but this process is very very 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.120
 long 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.699
 but there is a way to speed up for this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.909
 need to use a growth accelerator 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.149
 crystals crafting it as follows 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.200
 iron is required for this . 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.799
 glass cable 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.569
 quartz glass and changeable block this 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.950
 block can be crafted in two ways 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.469
 first way 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 changeable crystal of four here 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.869
 this way and the second way of 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.909
 pure changeable crystals after 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.159
 how did you download and install it he 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.020
 looks like this for his 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.049
 work must be submitted to him 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.670
 maximum energy he consumes only 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.829
 only almost 8 energy units per tick at 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.840
 this from that race put here 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.279
 seeds regardless how much it will be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.400
 consume energy that is he always 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:53.780
 consumes one value 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.040
 so let us take the seeds now 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 let's say these are the seeds of the true 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.710
 quartz and throw them 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 water should be installed correctly 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.720
 so that it comes into contact with 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.080
 block of water if we wait a little 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.640
 literally seconds 5 10 and take our 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.890
 the seeds 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.220
 then we will see that they have already grown by 1 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 percentage if we go back to those seeds 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.010
 who threw him here and pick them up 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.640
 there we will see zero percent that is growth 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.740
 very slow here I threw 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.440
 seeds already quite a long time ago and if we 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.080
 let's see who we see they just grew 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.320
 at 7 percent though they are already here somewhere 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 10-15 minutes just can not say but 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.510
 a long time ago also regardless of 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 how many seeds you threw there 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.460
 they all will have a growth rate 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.740
 the same way and as I said energy he 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.960
 will consume one quantity when 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.570
 it works we see the texture starts 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.900
 overflow 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:02.400
 there are three stages of growth that's when you 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.950
 threw all then 33 percent 66 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.120
 percent and already all clean changeable 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.069
 cross 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.569
 that is, this is the final stage of growth you 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.269
 you just take it away 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.459
 and you can use it in the boxes 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.409
 for example you can 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.690
 changeable crystal replaced with pure 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.879
 mutable crystal of true crystal 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.909
 quartz on pure crystal true 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.890
 quartz quartz on pure quartz crystal 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.840
 the lower world that is, these here 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.329
 crystals they are needed to replace here 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.549
 these and it is beneficial because of one 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.579
 such a crystal you get two here 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.579
 such 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.420
 so let us make it lighter and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.299
 take these seeds here that I 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:51.459
 threw here and see 14 percent 13 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:54.099
 before 9 and 14 we see how fast they are 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.849
 began to grow and passed literally well 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.680
 twenty seconds thirty no more in 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.840
 Generally put all the likes on it 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.049
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.049
 meeting
