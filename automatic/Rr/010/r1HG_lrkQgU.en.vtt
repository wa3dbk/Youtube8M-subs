00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 civil protest yesterday in favara of six 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.600
 households that for various 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 vicissitudes occupy for a few months 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.820
 illegally as many lodgings 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.469
 popular in the flat district of the peri la 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 condition of economic hardship in which 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 they poured them into mbor cesar yes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 of the apartments already assigned but not 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.730
 inhabited of the building b of piazza don 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 trees are different stories than those 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 they mark each of the occupants 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 situations, however, that all gravitate to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 around the need to have a roof 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.309
 under which live some of them 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 many young people had a house 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.079
 but the precarious conditions of the buildings 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.969
 they forced them to abandon them 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 the houses where I lived before were not 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.489
 drinkable and I went to the mayor 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 to give me help but he had 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.110
 the stubborn head gave me none 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.250
 help and I'm talking about why this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.859
 home was rightly rejected and me 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.410
 I live there now and it doesn't seem right 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.960
 that throws me out with kids like 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.510
 I already have children with her and my sister has children 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.400
 one he has 12 she he has two she 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 it has 2 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 in short, we get screwed because we have 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
 need you thinking that if we had 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.259
 a salary where we could rent 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.450
 a house we stayed here I think no 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 families to which he was ordered to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.590
 leave the apartments within 30 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 days do not accept the fact that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 ranking apart from needy people 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 they have no right to a home in the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 almost all of the families 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.570
 there are some small children some of the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.070
 what sick split thing is alone 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.899
 nice but a destination that my vote 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.890
 son and my wife I was mayor log 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.729
 always sick in my caere casoni 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.290
 children would seem to slam him wait 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.780
 he was expecting it and I just hope to do this 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.600
 life I did I came later 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.810
 two months ago for a while we were a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.729
 since the houses were empty, I am 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.340
 took advantage that the mayor still 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.159
 he had given the others that they were from the tower 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.060
 I was not the author but I had not 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.250
 home having no money having no money 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.989
 take advantage of this when your children a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.810
 she this second when reported c in 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.420
 square of trees currently of 56 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.540
 six other accommodations would not turn out 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.870
 inhabited you talked about people who have 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.549
 renounced the apartment yes there are 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 There have been many people who have refused 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.840
 then the apartments that will come 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 said the mouths you know the keys are 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.599
 were withdrawn and delivered new 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.840
 theme song 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.790
 after that we saw that later 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.579
 four months did not deliver 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.609
 keys to those on the list 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.709
 we are almost without entering el 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.950
 today it means that nobody was there 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.340
 after us and after that others don't 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.970
 you are the first thing but we don't have it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.250
 chance we have nothing first or last 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.709
 which of it was abusive six months e 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.040
 that of creative silk to everyone 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.540
 abusive all the mayor of Agrigento 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.540
 what arrives children did them 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.130
 petrangeli can do something about this 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.319
 which ones do you want to do nothing then you 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.639
 you would be willing to leave the lodgings 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.950
 in exchange for a rent contribution no no 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.160
 not even my doubt of attribute 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.019
 I don't even explain why I explain it 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.880
 because I don't 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.069
 you say why you don't know it gives you a 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.139
 contribution because even if I pay myself a 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.750
 year of rental one year's rent expires 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:59.280
 and the other money who deserves to pay 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:01.379
 the apartment that long but the times that 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.840
 we now hangs from a white not us 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.879
 it will easily be the presence of the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.280
 abusive tenants do not worry the 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.290
 other assignees who even line up 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.049
 in favor of the same to a few people 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.400
 like me, the house has given us 15 is 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.650
 been assigned 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.200
 I speak for and these people 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.420
 because outside I can people 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.000
 we can think that they are 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.430
 bad people and that this is a 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 container where all of the whole scum 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.140
 of favara so come I feel good 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.730
 with these people because they did it 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.510
 what they did I did not do for 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.640
 malanje the age to feel experts have 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.290
 done because they have a need there are 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.180
 fathers and mothers of families who have two 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.970
 three children and they don't even make it to 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.540
 eat so I think and believe the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.940
 mayor must understand what favara needs 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.060
 other like hulls belgium countries so can 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.490
 walk like water that sends and everything 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.910
 the rest that is not to worry about these 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.390
 people but try to help them 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.340
 favara from 23 January 2010, the condition 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.980
 housing of many families in the center 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.240
 historical has changed into a real one 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.310
 emergency 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.410
 to this we must add the crisis 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.630
 occupational desperation of those 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.120
 people still hoping for a future 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.730
 better at least for their children than for 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.870
 today they play freely in the spaces they 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.740
 in a civil society 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.740
 they all deserve
