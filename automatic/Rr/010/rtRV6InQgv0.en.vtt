00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.300 
ribbon cable there in the back of the
screen<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.829> thing<00:01:49.920> holding

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
screen so then the only thing holding

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.149 
screen so then the only thing holding
the<00:01:50.399> screen<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.680> four<00:01:52.680> bolts<00:01:53.070> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the screen in it is the four bolts on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.240 
the screen in it is the four bolts on
the<00:01:53.280> side<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:55.680> always<00:01:55.890> nice<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the side one there it's always nice to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.999 
the side one there it's always nice to
do<00:01:56.810> opposite<00:01:57.810> corners<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.380> way<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> screen

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
do opposite corners that way the screen

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
do opposite corners that way the screen
isn't<00:01:59.310> hanging<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.790> there<00:01:59.939> by<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.270> bolt<00:02:00.540> makes

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
isn't hanging on there by one bolt makes

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.630 
isn't hanging on there by one bolt makes
a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.799> easier<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> deal<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:04.430> then<00:02:05.430> once

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
a little easier to deal with then once

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.529 
a little easier to deal with then once
those<00:02:05.820> screws<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.689> screen<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.259> free

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
those screws are out the screen is free

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
those screws are out the screen is free
so<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.920> grab

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so now all you have to do is just grab

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.840 
so now all you have to do is just grab
your<00:02:11.520> new<00:02:11.640> screen

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
your new screen

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.070 
your new screen
take<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.500> plastic<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.930> came

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
take it out of the plastic that it came

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.700 
take it out of the plastic that it came
in<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.520> then<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.450> usually<00:02:19.630> find<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.320> easier<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
in and then I usually find it easier to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.520 
in and then I usually find it easier to
remove<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.970> tape<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:22.990> holding<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
remove the tape that's holding the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.790 
remove the tape that's holding the
plastic<00:02:24.220> cover<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> screen<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.800> mean

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
plastic cover on the screen off I mean

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.590 
plastic cover on the screen off I mean
you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.160> do<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.310> after<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.210> all<00:02:28.390> fully

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
you can do it after you get it all fully

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.200 
you can do it after you get it all fully
put<00:02:28.810> together<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.650> lot<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.700> times<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.000> just

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
put together but a lot of times is just

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.790 
put together but a lot of times is just
easier<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:31.990> I'll<00:02:32.230> have<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> deal<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
easier so I'll have to deal with the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.740 
easier so I'll have to deal with the
tape<00:02:32.950> later<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> pull<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.440> off<00:02:36.600> take<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
tape later so pull that off take the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
tape later so pull that off take the
screen<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.390> then<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.810> start<00:02:41.080> lining<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.680> up

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
screen and then you start lining it up

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.540 
screen and then you start lining it up
so<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.280> way<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:43.000> put<00:02:43.660> screws<00:02:43.990> in<00:02:44.550> be

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
so that way you can put screws in be

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.100 
so that way you can put screws in be
kind<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.790> difficult<00:02:46.030> at<00:02:46.420> times<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
kind of difficult at times because the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.730 
kind of difficult at times because the
screw<00:02:47.470> likes<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.890> fall<00:02:48.100> off<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.690> once<00:02:53.620> you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
screw likes to fall off then once you

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.250 
screw likes to fall off then once you
get<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.130> side<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.050> matter

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
get the one side in it's just a matter

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.560 
get the one side in it's just a matter
of<00:02:56.380> getting<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.580> other<00:02:57.730> side<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.480> then

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
of getting the other side in and then

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.370 
of getting the other side in and then
the<00:02:58.690> screen<00:02:58.900> will<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.140> held<00:02:59.560> up<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.170> can<00:03:02.230> get

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
the screen will be held up if I can get

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.660 
the screen will be held up if I can get
screwed<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.830> stay<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.920> twist<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.490> in

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
other corner but then doing that will

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.190 
other corner but then doing that will
make<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.490> back<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.570> case<00:04:07.780> can<00:04:07.810> stay

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
make it so the back of the case can stay

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.780 
make it so the back of the case can stay
on<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> screen<00:04:08.590> nice<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.220> wall

tape<00:04:39.610> went<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.910> little<00:04:40.000> too<00:04:40.120> far<00:04:40.389> so<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.720> just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
tape went a little too far so I just

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.050 
tape went a little too far so I just
kind<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.500> cut<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.919> little<00:04:42.130> bit<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.550> off<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
kind of cut a little bit of that off the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.890 
kind of cut a little bit of that off the
screwdriver<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.620> plugged<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.100> in<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.900> then

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
screwdriver and I plugged it in and then

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.310 
screwdriver and I plugged it in and then
I'll<00:04:47.169> put<00:04:48.010> screw<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.970> one<00:04:49.150> side<00:04:49.450> make<00:04:50.169> sure

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
I'll put screw in the one side make sure

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.710 
I'll put screw in the one side make sure
it's<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.560> right<00:04:50.710> side<00:04:51.150> because<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.389> left

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
it's the right side because the left

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.629 
it's the right side because the left
side<00:04:52.930> one's<00:04:53.139> held<00:04:53.350> on<00:04:53.500> by<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.710> outside

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
side one's held on by the outside

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.680 
side one's held on by the outside
plastic<00:04:55.120> bumper<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:57.010> then<00:04:57.210> start<00:04:58.210> lining<00:04:58.600> that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
plastic bumper so then start lining that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.180 
plastic bumper so then start lining that
all<00:04:58.900> up<00:05:00.540> up<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.720> push<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.830> little<00:05:03.040> bit

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
all up up that push on it a little bit

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.719 
all up up that push on it a little bit
and<00:05:03.370> they<00:05:03.610> all<00:05:03.729> should<00:05:04.330> pop<00:05:04.570> right<00:05:04.810> in

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
and they all should pop right in

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.700 
and they all should pop right in
relatively<00:05:06.729> easily<00:05:10.350> down<00:05:11.350> here<00:05:11.530> on<00:05:11.620> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
relatively easily down here on the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.440 
relatively easily down here on the
corner<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.130> was<00:05:12.190> giving<00:05:12.490> me<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.850> little<00:05:13.120> bit<00:05:13.300> of

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
corner it was giving me a little bit of

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.530 
corner it was giving me a little bit of
trouble<00:05:13.750> but<00:05:14.020> just<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:15.700> little<00:05:15.790> more<00:05:16.060> sometimes

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
trouble but just a little more sometimes

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.700 
trouble but just a little more sometimes
you<00:05:16.780> get<00:05:16.870> pressed<00:05:17.110> from<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.320> back<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
you get pressed from the back of the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.190 
you get pressed from the back of the
screen<00:05:17.979> too<00:05:18.160> so<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.550> can<00:05:18.729> size<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.539> flexes<00:05:20.169> a

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
screen too so it can size it flexes a

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.830 
screen too so it can size it flexes a
little<00:05:20.500> bit<00:05:20.970> then<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.180> put<00:05:22.390> in<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.630> four

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
little bit then you just put in the four

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.140 
little bit then you just put in the four
screws<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.500> went<00:05:23.860> down<00:05:24.010> there<00:05:24.280> well<00:05:24.880> five

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
screws I went down there well five

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.370 
screws I went down there well five
screws<00:05:25.450> one<00:05:25.750> there<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.680> middle<00:05:28.260> one<00:05:29.260> right

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
screws one there in the middle one right

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.950 
screws one there in the middle one right
there<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:32.550> then<00:05:33.550> one<00:05:34.030> on<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.270> top<00:05:34.419> right<00:05:34.690> and

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.110 

then<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.320> one<00:05:38.470> on<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.740> top<00:05:38.890> left

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.129 

and<00:05:44.720> then<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:46.400> screw<00:05:46.810> wasn't<00:05:47.810> wanting<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.050> go

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
and then this screw wasn't wanting to go

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.960 
and then this screw wasn't wanting to go
in<00:05:48.260> all<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.440> way<00:05:48.530> but<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.710> just<00:05:48.889> had<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.160> push<00:05:49.940> it

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
in all the way but I just had to push it

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.390 
in all the way but I just had to push it
a<00:05:50.180> little<00:05:50.360> bit<00:05:50.480> more<00:05:50.600> so<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:51.020> was<00:05:51.110> in<00:05:51.400> then

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
a little bit more so that was in then

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.010 
a little bit more so that was in then
he's<00:05:52.669> got<00:05:52.820> to<00:05:52.850> put<00:05:53.090> in<00:05:53.210> all<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.479> little<00:05:53.720> bumper
