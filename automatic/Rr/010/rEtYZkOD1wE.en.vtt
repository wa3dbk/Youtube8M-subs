00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
exactly easy but so far is the most

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.229 
exactly easy but so far is the most
effective<00:02:21.350> way<00:02:21.500> i<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.739> think<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.370> don't

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
effective way i can think of I don't

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.479 
effective way i can think of I don't
know<00:02:23.299> any<00:02:23.510> other<00:02:23.570> ways<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:23.959> no<00:02:24.590> had<00:02:24.890> dealing

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
know any other ways that no had dealing

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:35.039 
know any other ways that no had dealing
with<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.760> guy<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.690> quickest

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.459 

and<00:02:36.049> there<00:02:36.230> goes<00:02:36.409> aunt<00:02:36.739> line<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.670> nutshell

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
and there goes aunt line in a nutshell

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.759 
and there goes aunt line in a nutshell
like<00:02:39.469> again<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.739> said<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.639> again<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:42.590> guy

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
like again I said like a again this guy

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.530 
like again I said like a again this guy
can<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.040> taken<00:02:43.280> out<00:02:43.370> easily<00:02:43.549> just<00:02:43.969> stay<00:02:44.450> in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
can be taken out easily just stay in

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
can be taken out easily just stay in
your<00:02:44.569> room<00:02:44.719> because<00:02:45.319> his<00:02:45.439> jaw<00:02:46.010> attack<00:02:46.310> kind<00:02:46.670> of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
your room because his jaw attack kind of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.440 
your room because his jaw attack kind of
goes<00:02:47.480> over<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:49.519> that's<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.239> best

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
goes over you so that that's the best

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.300 
goes over you so that that's the best
method<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.959> think<00:02:51.139> of<00:02:51.290> otherwise<00:02:52.069> if<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
method I can think of otherwise if you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.190 
method I can think of otherwise if you
try<00:02:52.459> run<00:02:52.639> away<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:52.849> him<00:02:53.120> most<00:02:53.629> likely<00:02:53.780> as<00:02:53.989> ja

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
try run away from him most likely as ja

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.860 
try run away from him most likely as ja
tak<00:02:54.439> will<00:02:54.620> hit<00:02:54.799> you'll<00:02:54.950> make<00:02:55.219> contact<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.969> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
tak will hit you'll make contact and the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.629 
tak will hit you'll make contact and the
stunning<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:57.590> give<00:02:57.799> you<00:02:57.829> lots<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.489> damage

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
stunning you and give you lots of damage

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.039 
stunning you and give you lots of damage
so<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.840> not<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> recommended<00:03:00.379> tactic<00:03:01.930> most<00:03:02.930> of

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
so it's not a recommended tactic most of

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.509 
so it's not a recommended tactic most of
the<00:03:03.109> times<00:03:03.290> when<00:03:03.439> people<00:03:03.469> plays<00:03:04.219> a

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
the times when people plays a

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.580 
the times when people plays a
multiplayer<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.930> got<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.169> just<00:03:06.260> keep<00:03:06.469> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
multiplayer you got to just keep the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.990 
multiplayer you got to just keep the
child's<00:03:06.889> close<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.219> you<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.340> people<00:03:07.579> will

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
child's close to you and people will

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.670 
child's close to you and people will
actually<00:03:08.180> take<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.599> damage<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.199> just<00:03:09.500> run

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
actually take the damage and just run

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.959 
actually take the damage and just run
around<00:03:09.769> behind<00:03:10.129> them<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:10.579> attack<00:03:10.849> them

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
around behind them and just attack them

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.599 
around behind them and just attack them
from<00:03:11.000> there<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:12.099> while<00:03:13.099> there's<00:03:13.310> some<00:03:13.459> guy

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
from there and while there's some guy

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.729 
from there and while there's some guy
distracting<00:03:14.120> them<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.269> front<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.870> it's<00:03:15.709> a

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
distracting them in front so it's a

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.319 
distracting them in front so it's a
pretty<00:03:15.919> neat<00:03:16.099> tactic<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:16.639> like<00:03:16.849> that<00:03:17.030> but

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
pretty neat tactic I like that but

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.599 
pretty neat tactic I like that but
otherwise<00:03:18.079> way<00:03:18.409> sher<00:03:18.620> khan<00:03:18.680> fight<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.400> guy

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
out of here I'm assuming that they found

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.610 
out of here I'm assuming that they found
an<00:05:35.620> escalator<00:05:36.099> somewhere<00:05:36.550> or<00:05:37.090> uh<00:05:37.120> or<00:05:37.620> some

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
an escalator somewhere or uh or some

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.830 
an escalator somewhere or uh or some
stairs<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.190> honestly<00:05:39.789> don't<00:05:40.120> know<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:40.570> don't

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
stairs I honestly don't know but don't

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.240 
stairs I honestly don't know but don't
pick<00:05:41.050> anything<00:05:41.260> up<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.710> that's<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.010> complete

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
pick anything up and that's the complete

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.790 
pick anything up and that's the complete
opposite<00:05:42.699> of<00:05:42.760> what<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.000> did<00:05:43.380> all<00:05:44.380> right<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:44.770> I

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
opposite of what I did all right so I

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.230 
opposite of what I did all right so I
guess<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.840> forebode<00:05:46.840> something<00:05:47.260> good<00:05:47.470> and

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
guess that forebode something good and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.320 
guess that forebode something good and
actually<00:05:49.240> yeah<00:05:49.510> did<00:05:49.750> give<00:05:49.960> me<00:05:50.020> something<00:05:50.260> good

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
actually yeah did give me something good

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.149 
actually yeah did give me something good
masquerade<00:05:52.330> a<00:05:52.800> pretty<00:05:53.800> good<00:05:53.949> item

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
masquerades are not exactly too hard to

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.490 
masquerades are not exactly too hard to
find<00:05:57.310> but<00:05:57.639> they're<00:05:58.419> pretty<00:05:58.570> good<00:05:58.720> I'll<00:05:59.289> take

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
find but they're pretty good I'll take

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.360 
find but they're pretty good I'll take
