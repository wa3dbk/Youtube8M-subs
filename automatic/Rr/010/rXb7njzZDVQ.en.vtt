episode of sharing is caring I've got
two<00:00:05.009> very<00:00:05.040> good<00:00:05.759> designs<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> today<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
two very good designs for you today the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.470 
two very good designs for you today the
first<00:00:07.200> one<00:00:07.560> got<00:00:07.830> sent<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.250> me<00:00:08.370> by<00:00:08.400> titi<00:00:09.090> lemon

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
first one got sent to me by titi lemon

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.770 
first one got sent to me by titi lemon
he<00:00:10.200> calls<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.730> extended<00:00:11.730> sealing<00:00:12.450> block

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
he calls it the extended sealing block

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.410 
he calls it the extended sealing block
update<00:00:13.200> detector<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.340> way<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> works<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
update detector the way it works is the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.640 
update detector the way it works is the
moment<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.440> minecart<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.699> blocks<00:00:17.970> above

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
moment a minecart is two blocks above

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.500 
moment a minecart is two blocks above
piston<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.890> update<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.369> piston<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
piston and you update the piston it is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.230 
piston and you update the piston it is
going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> extend<00:00:22.289> once<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> extends<00:00:23.970> it's

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
going to extend once it extends it's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.439 
going to extend once it extends it's
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.750> send<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> signal<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.240> going

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
going to send a signal that it's going

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.589 
going to send a signal that it's going
to<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.900> inverted<00:00:28.380> twice<00:00:29.300> which<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.480> then

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to get inverted twice which will then

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.530 
to get inverted twice which will then
cause<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:33.260> piston<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:37.890> extend<00:00:38.460> downwards<00:00:38.940> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
cause a piston to extend downwards so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
cause a piston to extend downwards so
basically<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.590> you've<00:00:41.430> got

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
basically what you can do now you've got

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
basically what you can do now you've got
a<00:00:41.610> block<00:00:41.850> update<00:00:42.239> push<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.110> push<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.379> back

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
a block update push it up push it back

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.389 
a block update push it up push it back
down<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.739> outputs<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:47.070> any

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
down and you can take outputs from any

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.750 
down and you can take outputs from any
of<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.760> torches<00:00:48.360> anywhere<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.760> what

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of these torches anywhere you want what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
of these torches anywhere you want what
you<00:00:50.850> could<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.890> first<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> all

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you could use this for is first of all

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
you could use this for is first of all
it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.760> block<00:00:54.149> update<00:00:54.360> detector<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it is a block update detector that is in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.590 
it is a block update detector that is in
the<00:00:55.410> ceiling<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.390> people

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the ceiling but what I could see people

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
the ceiling but what I could see people
use<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.399> mainly<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.640> probably<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
use this for mainly is probably going to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.399 
use this for mainly is probably going to
be<00:01:01.370> switches<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.699> minecart<00:01:03.300> tracks<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.229> guys

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
be switches for minecart tracks you guys

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
be switches for minecart tracks you guys
have<00:01:04.530> probably<00:01:04.710> seen<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:06.049> fence<00:01:07.049> gates<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
have probably seen a fence gates on the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.200 
have probably seen a fence gates on the
ceilings<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> lets<00:01:08.909> players

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
ceilings and some of lets players

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.160 
ceilings and some of lets players
episode<00:01:09.869> let's<00:01:10.020> look<00:01:10.080> basically<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
episode let's look basically when you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.370 
episode let's look basically when you
open<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.290> close<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> fence<00:01:14.040> gate<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.390> send

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
open or close a fence gate you will send

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
open or close a fence gate you will send
a<00:01:16.439> pulse<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.979> therefore<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.909> could<00:01:18.090> change

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a pulse and therefore you could change

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.350 
a pulse and therefore you could change
the<00:01:18.630> direction<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.670> off<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.880> minecart<00:01:21.299> track

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the direction of off your minecart track

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560 
the direction of off your minecart track
which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.229> useful<00:01:23.180> another<00:01:24.180> thing<00:01:24.420> what

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
which is very useful another thing what

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
which is very useful another thing what
you<00:01:24.659> could<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.470> i<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you could use this for which i think is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940 
you could use this for which i think is
maybe<00:01:26.460> even<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:27.030> useful<00:01:27.619> which<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.829> I'm

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
maybe even more useful which what I'm

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.670 
maybe even more useful which what I'm
currently<00:01:29.729> using<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.329> project<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
currently using in my project is if you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
currently using in my project is if you
extend<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.520> five<00:01:32.970> six<00:01:33.360> seven<00:01:33.930> eight<00:01:34.170> nine

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
extend this so five six seven eight nine

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
extend this so five six seven eight nine
ten<00:01:35.130> eleven<00:01:35.729> twelve<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:38.400> put<00:01:38.700> another

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
ten eleven twelve and you put another

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
ten eleven twelve and you put another
minecart<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:42.049> with<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> torch<00:01:43.530> o<00:01:44.329> torch<00:01:45.740> block

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
minecart here with a torch o torch block

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.330 
minecart here with a torch o torch block
torch<00:01:47.610> block<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.950> torch<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
torch block and a torch and you have

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.959 
torch block and a torch and you have
another<00:01:55.130> piston<00:01:56.130> facing<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
another piston facing down what you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
another piston facing down what you
could<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.600> send<00:01:57.899> signals<00:01:58.350> very

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
could do is you can send signals very

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.330 
could do is you can send signals very
high<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.990> very<00:02:00.990> fast<00:02:01.259> without<00:02:01.710> any<00:02:01.979> sort<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
high up very fast without any sort of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.149 
high up very fast without any sort of
interference<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.680> cool<00:02:04.860> part<00:02:05.100> about

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
interference and the cool part about

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.580 
interference and the cool part about
this<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.820> long<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.899> tile<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this is as long as you you can tile this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
this is as long as you you can tile this
next<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> each<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:09.450> long<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.810> make

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
next to each other as long as you make

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.720 
next to each other as long as you make
sure<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> minecarts<00:02:11.099> cannot<00:02:11.489> get

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
sure that the minecarts cannot get

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
sure that the minecarts cannot get
pushed<00:02:12.060> out<00:02:12.209> or<00:02:12.390> anything<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
pushed out or anything like that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.569 
pushed out or anything like that
so<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.640> nice<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.420> useful<00:02:15.689> stuff<00:02:16.579> original

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
so very nice and useful stuff original

please thank you
there<00:02:58.500> we<00:02:58.560> go<00:02:58.939> another<00:02:59.939> to<00:03:00.299> take<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.599> leg

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
there we go another to take the leg

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.449 
there we go another to take the leg
repeater<00:03:01.459> then<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.760> redstone<00:03:03.359> dust<00:03:04.230> then<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
repeater then a redstone dust then a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.979 
repeater then a redstone dust then a
torch<00:03:06.139> then<00:03:07.139> we<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.739> down<00:03:08.639> here<00:03:08.780> around<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
torch then we go down here around the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.490 
torch then we go down here around the
corner<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:14.489> we<00:03:14.670> go<00:03:14.879> up<00:03:15.659> we<00:03:16.349> get<00:03:16.470> a

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
corner like this then we go up we get a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.069 
corner like this then we go up we get a
torch<00:03:18.919> glowstone<00:03:20.900> block<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.169> block<00:03:22.650> there

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
torch glowstone block there block there

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.170 
torch glowstone block there block there
extend<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.199> like<00:03:25.379> this<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.889> then<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.760> block

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
extend that like this and then a block

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.170 
extend that like this and then a block
over<00:03:27.569> there<00:03:28.410> now<00:03:29.129> what<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> see<00:03:30.510> here<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:32.180> once

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
over there now what you see here is once

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.789 
over there now what you see here is once
I<00:03:33.329> place<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.629> block<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.199> which<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.560> sort<00:03:34.769> of

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
I place a block here which is sort of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.689 
I place a block here which is sort of
very<00:03:34.980> important<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:35.879> not<00:03:36.209> if<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.569> now<00:03:36.690> get<00:03:36.900> a

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
very important if not if I now get a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:44.300 
very important if not if I now get a
lever<00:03:39.769> see<00:03:40.769> here<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.669> very<00:03:42.659> compact<00:03:43.310> flush

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
lever see here is a very compact flush

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.539 
lever see here is a very compact flush
with<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.609> floor<00:03:44.900> double<00:03:46.069> piston<00:03:47.069> extender

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
with the floor double piston extender

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.140 
with the floor double piston extender
which<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.510> by<00:03:48.720> itself<00:03:49.109> already<00:03:49.769> pretty<00:03:50.729> pretty

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
which is by itself already pretty pretty

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.920 
which is by itself already pretty pretty
darn<00:03:51.419> awesome

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
darn awesome

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.309 
darn awesome
I<00:03:52.019> think<00:03:52.319> but<00:03:53.190> differ<00:03:54.060> we<00:03:54.299> know<00:03:54.629> not<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.199> him

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
I think but differ we know not for him

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.059 
I think but differ we know not for him
and<00:03:55.530> he<00:03:55.769> he<00:03:56.579> goes<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:57.090> step<00:03:57.120> further<00:03:58.069> what

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
and he he goes one step further what

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.449 
and he he goes one step further what
he's<00:03:59.250> done<00:03:59.569> he<00:04:00.569> placed<00:04:01.049> another<00:04:01.470> tube<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:02.280> take

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
he's done he placed another tube to take

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.399 
he's done he placed another tube to take
Clara<00:04:02.729> Peter<00:04:02.970> here<00:04:03.349> with<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.530> torch<00:04:05.569> with<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.599> non

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
Clara Peter here with a torch with a non

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.020 
Clara Peter here with a torch with a non
sticky<00:04:07.799> piston<00:04:08.159> and<00:04:08.400> then<00:04:08.579> on<00:04:08.729> the<00:04:08.819> other<00:04:08.849> side

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
sticky piston and then on the other side

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.920 
sticky piston and then on the other side
yeah<00:04:09.959> any<00:04:10.169> sort<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:11.540> any<00:04:12.540> sort<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.810> block

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
yeah any sort of any sort of block

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.710 
yeah any sort of any sort of block
let's<00:04:15.470> see<00:04:17.650> from<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.799> torch<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.489> get

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
let's see from this torch you get

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.600 
let's see from this torch you get
redstone<00:04:20.720> dust<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.859> take<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.190> letter<00:04:22.310> Peter

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
redstone dust to take the letter Peter

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.480 
redstone dust to take the letter Peter
another<00:04:23.360> redstone<00:04:23.570> dust<00:04:24.020> we<00:04:24.949> go<00:04:25.070> up<00:04:26.080> like<00:04:27.080> this

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
another redstone dust we go up like this

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.379 
another redstone dust we go up like this
then<00:04:28.490> we<00:04:28.789> place<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:33.220> piston<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.460> come<00:04:35.270> on

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
then we place a piston here come on

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.499 
then we place a piston here come on
there<00:04:35.600> we<00:04:35.660> go<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.220> any<00:04:37.220> sort<00:04:37.370> of<00:04:37.699> block<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
there we go and any sort of block and

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.270 
there we go and any sort of block and
then<00:04:38.979> we<00:04:39.979> place<00:04:40.250> torch<00:04:40.610> here<00:04:41.530> now<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:43.100> rid

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
then we place torch here now we get rid

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.969 
then we place torch here now we get rid
of<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.490> lever<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:44.449> we<00:04:44.690> exchange<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.770> lever

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
of the lever and we exchange that lever

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.040 
of the lever and we exchange that lever
for<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.340> button<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.120> what<00:04:47.449> you<00:04:47.570> see<00:04:47.810> here<00:04:48.020> now

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
for a button and what you see here now

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.939 
for a button and what you see here now
is<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:49.660> flush<00:04:50.660> with<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.990> floor<00:04:51.169> double<00:04:51.770> piston

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
is a flush with the floor double piston

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.159 
is a flush with the floor double piston
