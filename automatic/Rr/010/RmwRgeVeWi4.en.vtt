supermarket or something these are fine

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.290 
supermarket or something these are fine
however<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.810> found<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.650> treading<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
however I found that the treading on the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.380 
however I found that the treading on the
bottom<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.870> doesn't<00:03:30.620> work<00:03:30.740> very<00:03:30.800> well<00:03:31.010> on

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
bottom it doesn't work very well on

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.830 
bottom it doesn't work very well on
slick<00:03:33.010> sheer<00:03:34.010> surfaces<00:03:34.490> like<00:03:34.790> what<00:03:35.060> tile<00:03:35.330> or

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
slick sheer surfaces like what tile or

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.930 
slick sheer surfaces like what tile or
the<00:03:36.530> metal<00:03:36.709> grates<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.340> find<00:03:37.580> sometimes

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
the metal grates that you find sometimes

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.340 
the metal grates that you find sometimes
on<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.150> sidewalk<00:03:38.510> when<00:03:38.660> those<00:03:38.780> get<00:03:38.930> wet<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.170> a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
on the sidewalk when those get wet on a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.890 
on the sidewalk when those get wet on a
rainy<00:03:39.590> day<00:03:39.650> these<00:03:40.160> slip<00:03:40.520> really<00:03:40.970> easily<00:03:41.270> so<00:03:41.540> if

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
rainy day these slip really easily so if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.090 
rainy day these slip really easily so if
you're<00:03:41.989> going<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.170> be<00:03:42.260> using<00:03:42.380> these<00:03:42.620> as<00:03:42.830> shower

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
you're going to be using these as shower

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.760 
you're going to be using these as shower
shoes<00:03:43.570> when<00:03:44.570> you're<00:03:44.720> traveling<00:03:45.080> I'd<00:03:45.260> highly

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
shoes when you're traveling I'd highly

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.380 
shoes when you're traveling I'd highly
recommend<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.370> be<00:03:46.550> extra<00:03:47.060> careful

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
recommend that you be extra careful

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.180 
recommend that you be extra careful
because<00:03:47.720> these<00:03:47.959> are<00:03:48.200> very<00:03:48.230> slippery<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:48.980> mean

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
because these are very slippery I mean

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.970 
because these are very slippery I mean
you<00:03:49.280> don't<00:03:49.370> really<00:03:49.520> get<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.790> good<00:03:49.940> grip<00:03:50.180> on<00:03:50.980> like

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
you don't really get a good grip on like

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.890 
you don't really get a good grip on like
wet<00:03:52.160> tile<00:03:52.370> or<00:03:52.550> any<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.790> those<00:03:52.850> surfaces<00:03:53.360> so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
wet tile or any of those surfaces so

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.380 
wet tile or any of those surfaces so
that's<00:03:54.050> something<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:55.130> might<00:03:56.000> want<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that's something that you might want to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.180 
that's something that you might want to
pay<00:03:56.510> attention<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.200> wish<00:03:57.680> they<00:03:57.860> would<00:03:58.010> put<00:03:58.160> a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
pay attention to I wish they would put a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.860 
pay attention to I wish they would put a
little<00:03:58.459> bit<00:03:58.580> more<00:03:58.790> aggressive<00:03:59.209> checkering<00:03:59.360> or

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
little bit more aggressive checkering or

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.199 
little bit more aggressive checkering or
a<00:03:59.959> kind<00:04:00.860> of<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.010> better<00:04:01.400> grip<00:04:01.670> pattern<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
a kind of a better grip pattern on the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.550 
a kind of a better grip pattern on the
bottom<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:02.720> can<00:04:02.840> get<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.959> better<00:04:03.110> hole<00:04:03.380> when

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
bottom so you can get a better hole when

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.100 
bottom so you can get a better hole when
you're<00:04:03.680> walking<00:04:04.390> actually<00:04:05.390> these<00:04:05.780> shoes

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you're walking actually these shoes

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.130 
you're walking actually these shoes
these<00:04:07.100> are<00:04:07.160> about<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.910> year<00:04:08.060> old<00:04:08.480> although

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
these are about a year old although

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.350 
these are about a year old although
they've<00:04:09.500> had<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.770> lifetime's<00:04:10.280> worth<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.790> travel

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
they've had a lifetime's worth of travel

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.540 
they've had a lifetime's worth of travel
put<00:04:11.750> into<00:04:12.020> them<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.320> think<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.770> wear<00:04:12.950> here<00:04:13.370> has

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
put into them I think the wear here has

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.479 
put into them I think the wear here has
one<00:04:13.760> these<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.150> over<00:04:14.360> Europe<00:04:15.340> Southeast<00:04:16.340> Asia

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
one these all over Europe Southeast Asia

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.490 
one these all over Europe Southeast Asia
like<00:04:16.850> Thailand<00:04:17.180> come

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
like Thailand come

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.740 
like Thailand come
Odia<00:04:17.680> Laos<00:04:17.950> Vietnam<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:21.540> Australia<00:04:22.540> I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
Odia Laos Vietnam and in Australia I

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.050 
Odia Laos Vietnam and in Australia I
think<00:04:22.960> these<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.320> been<00:04:23.410> worn<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:24.490> months<00:04:24.850> at

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
think these have been worn for months at

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.110 
think these have been worn for months at
a<00:04:25.150> time<00:04:25.270> every<00:04:25.720> day<00:04:26.290> all<00:04:26.560> day<00:04:26.730> so<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:27.970> see

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
a time every day all day so you can see

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.960 
a time every day all day so you can see
like<00:04:28.390> there's<00:04:29.170> not<00:04:29.380> even<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.650> pattern<00:04:29.980> how<00:04:30.850> does

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
like there's not even a pattern how does

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.340 
like there's not even a pattern how does
it<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.300> can<00:04:31.510> see<00:04:31.660> like<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.990> edge<00:04:32.140> right

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
it like you can see like the edge right

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.660 
it like you can see like the edge right
here<00:04:32.410> there's<00:04:32.740> still<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.980> faint<00:04:33.280> hint<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
here there's still a faint hint of it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.340 
here there's still a faint hint of it
but<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> mean<00:04:34.480> they've<00:04:34.630> worn<00:04:34.870> completely

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
but I mean they've worn completely

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.140 
but I mean they've worn completely
through<00:04:35.590> but<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:36.610> somebody<00:04:37.000> who's

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
through but this is like somebody who's

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.700 
through but this is like somebody who's
been<00:04:37.300> wearing<00:04:37.510> these<00:04:37.600> all<00:04:37.780> day<00:04:38.110> every<00:04:38.380> day<00:04:38.410> for

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
been wearing these all day every day for

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.320 
been wearing these all day every day for
like<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.830> year<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:39.700> can<00:04:39.820> see<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.150> it's

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
like a year and you can see that it's

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.920 
like a year and you can see that it's
been<00:04:40.480> pressed<00:04:41.290> down<00:04:41.580> pretty<00:04:42.580> much<00:04:42.850> until<00:04:43.750> it's

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
been pressed down pretty much until it's

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.220 
been pressed down pretty much until it's
flat<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.830> mean<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.220> tried<00:04:45.700> these<00:04:45.850> on<00:04:46.230> we're

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
flat but I mean I tried these on we're

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.960 
flat but I mean I tried these on we're
actually<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.590> same<00:04:47.740> shoe<00:04:47.920> size<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.400> these

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
actually the same shoe size and these

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.690 
actually the same shoe size and these
are<00:04:49.270> still<00:04:50.020> soft<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.470> they're<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:50.830> comfy<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:51.370> I

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
are still soft and they're so comfy so I

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.040 
are still soft and they're so comfy so I
mean<00:04:51.880> even<00:04:52.090> though<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.390> treads<00:04:52.630> weren't<00:04:52.870> away

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
mean even though the treads weren't away

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.900 
mean even though the treads weren't away
I<00:04:53.080> mean<00:04:53.350> they're<00:04:53.500> still<00:04:53.650> usable<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.730> as

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
I mean they're still usable and like as

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.880 
I mean they're still usable and like as
you<00:04:55.030> can<00:04:55.150> see<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.810> top<00:04:56.020> upper<00:04:56.380> hasn't<00:04:56.710> broken

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
you can see the top upper hasn't broken

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.480 
you can see the top upper hasn't broken
off<00:04:57.070> yet

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
off yet

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
guys oh another thing besides the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.880 
guys oh another thing besides the
shredding<00:05:07.240> another<00:05:08.020> issue<00:05:08.169> I<00:05:08.320> would<00:05:08.440> have

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
shredding another issue I would have

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.940 
shredding another issue I would have
take<00:05:09.190> two<00:05:09.490> take<00:05:09.669> for<00:05:09.850> this's<00:05:10.710> even<00:05:11.710> though<00:05:11.800> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
take two take for this's even though the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.060 
take two take for this's even though the
soft<00:05:12.460> mush<00:05:12.760> up<00:05:13.000> top<00:05:13.900> sole<00:05:14.140> is<00:05:14.410> really<00:05:14.919> really

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
soft mush up top sole is really really

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.680 
soft mush up top sole is really really
soft<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.700> also<00:05:15.850> drives<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.240> little<00:05:16.419> bit<00:05:16.510> slower

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
soft it also drives a little bit slower

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.530 
soft it also drives a little bit slower
so<00:05:16.810> unlike<00:05:17.710> conventional<00:05:17.860> rubber<00:05:18.760> flip-flops

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
so unlike conventional rubber flip-flops

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.730 
so unlike conventional rubber flip-flops
that<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:20.020> would<00:05:20.140> wear<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.500> shower<00:05:20.650> and

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
that you would wear to the shower and

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.260 
that you would wear to the shower and
they'd<00:05:20.860> be<00:05:21.010> dry<00:05:21.190> in<00:05:21.250> five<00:05:21.460> minutes<00:05:21.760> these<00:05:21.880> will

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
they'd be dry in five minutes these will

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.820 
they'd be dry in five minutes these will
take<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.510> little<00:05:22.660> bit<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.990> time<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.440> dry<00:05:23.590> off

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
take a little bit of time to dry off

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.500 
take a little bit of time to dry off
because<00:05:24.250> they<00:05:24.460> are<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.729> soft<00:05:24.970> and<00:05:25.150> porous

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
because they are so soft and porous

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.930 
because they are so soft and porous
another<00:05:26.410> thing<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.130> top<00:05:27.310> straps<00:05:27.610> here<00:05:27.790> are

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
another thing is the top straps here are

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.330 
another thing is the top straps here are
always<00:05:28.510> cloth<00:05:28.780> on<00:05:29.440> all<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.740> models<00:05:29.860> I've<00:05:30.130> seen

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
always cloth on all the models I've seen

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.890 
always cloth on all the models I've seen
anyways<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:30.850> because<00:05:31.450> of<00:05:31.479> that<00:05:31.600> when<00:05:31.810> you

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
anyways and because of that when you

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.420 
anyways and because of that when you
wear<00:05:32.020> these<00:05:32.140> in<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.380> shower<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:33.070> will<00:05:33.250> take

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
wear these in the shower this will take

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.860 
wear these in the shower this will take
a<00:05:33.460> little<00:05:33.610> bit<00:05:33.820> longer<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.270> dry<00:05:34.390> I<00:05:34.479> have<00:05:34.630> much

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
a little bit longer to dry I have much

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.620 
a little bit longer to dry I have much
wish<00:05:35.380> Ruud<00:05:35.919> rather<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.400> they<00:05:36.550> used<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:37.030> nylon

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
wish Ruud rather that they used a nylon

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.560 
wish Ruud rather that they used a nylon
webbing<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:38.680> some<00:05:39.040> sort<00:05:39.280> so<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.850> top<00:05:40.060> upper<00:05:40.390> it

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
webbing of some sort so the top upper it

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.969 
webbing of some sort so the top upper it
would<00:05:40.720> still<00:05:40.930> be<00:05:41.050> just<00:05:41.080> as<00:05:41.410> durable<00:05:41.770> and

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
would still be just as durable and

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.530 
would still be just as durable and
because<00:05:42.490> it's<00:05:42.700> synthetic<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.240> would<00:05:43.330> drive

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
because it's synthetic it would drive

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.510 
because it's synthetic it would drive
faster<00:05:44.200> than<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.560> cotton<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.190> they<00:05:45.340> have

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
faster than this cotton that they have

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.760 
faster than this cotton that they have
on<00:05:45.729> top<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.510> those<00:05:47.080> are<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.260> only<00:05:47.320> issues<00:05:47.650> I

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
on top so those are the only issues I

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.400 
on top so those are the only issues I
have<00:05:47.950> with<00:05:47.979> them<00:05:48.720> still<00:05:49.720> love<00:05:49.870> these<00:05:50.050> though<00:05:50.260> I
