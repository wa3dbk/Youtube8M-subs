00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this is a tool that is what made my

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.970 
this is a tool that is what made my
previous<00:00:15.480> tutorial<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.109> manually<00:00:16.619> finding

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
previous tutorial on manually finding

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
previous tutorial on manually finding
these<00:00:17.070> offsets<00:00:17.580> obsolete<00:00:18.330> makes<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.170> much

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
these offsets obsolete makes it so much

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.349 
these offsets obsolete makes it so much
easier<00:00:19.430> left--oh<00:00:20.430> since<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> man<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
easier left--oh since the man for this

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.230 
easier left--oh since the man for this
stuff<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> open<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.850> the

to<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> original<00:02:05.399> offsets<00:02:05.909> from<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to get the original offsets from the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020 
to get the original offsets from the
original<00:02:06.899> retail<00:02:07.409> roster<00:02:08.220> which<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.819> have

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
original retail roster which I have

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.809 
original retail roster which I have
right<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.440> comes<00:02:10.709> with

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
right here and this is what comes with

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.229 
right here and this is what comes with
the<00:02:12.950> roster<00:02:13.950> editor<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.939> need<00:02:15.090> these

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
the roster editor and if you need these

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.089 
the roster editor and if you need these
values<00:02:15.659> feel<00:02:16.349> free<00:02:16.469> to<00:02:16.620> shoot<00:02:16.799> me<00:02:16.859> a<00:02:16.980> message

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
values feel free to shoot me a message

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.489 
values feel free to shoot me a message
or<00:02:17.730> an<00:02:17.909> email<00:02:17.969> or<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.689> know<00:02:18.780> whatever<00:02:18.989> i'll

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
or an email or you know whatever i'll

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.550 
or an email or you know whatever i'll
get<00:02:19.680> them<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.889> you<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.269> need<00:02:21.560> something

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
get them to you so we need something

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.649 
get them to you so we need something
around<00:02:23.780> 148<00:02:25.219> 699<00:02:26.219> seven<00:02:26.939> this<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.120> where<00:02:27.480> in

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
around 148 699 seven this is where in

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.289 
around 148 699 seven this is where in
the<00:02:27.749> rust<00:02:28.019> or<00:02:28.260> file<00:02:28.439> itself<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.670> jersey<00:02:30.090> tab

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the rust or file itself the jersey tab

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.990 
the rust or file itself the jersey tab
begins<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.829> need<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> find<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.670> we're

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
begins and we need to find so we're

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.280 
begins and we need to find so we're
going<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> start<00:02:33.329> somewhere<00:02:33.569> near<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.079> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
going to start somewhere near there so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.420 
going to start somewhere near there so
let's<00:02:34.500> start<00:02:34.739> at<00:02:35.069> one<00:02:35.909> for<00:02:36.299> 80<00:02:37.040> 000<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.400> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
let's start at one for 80 000 so a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.000 
let's start at one for 80 000 so a
little<00:02:38.639> bit<00:02:38.790> before<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.239> area<00:02:39.810> go<00:02:40.739> ahead<00:02:40.889> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
little bit before that area go ahead and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.240 
little bit before that area go ahead and
hit<00:02:41.099> enter<00:02:41.310> oh<00:02:42.379> and<00:02:43.379> we<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> winner<00:02:44.069> we

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
hit enter oh and we have a winner we

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.099 
hit enter oh and we have a winner we
already<00:02:44.639> found<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:45.180> that's<00:02:45.480> how<00:02:45.659> nice<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
already found it that's how nice this

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.199 
already found it that's how nice this
tool<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:47.219> don't<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.519> go<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.969> hex

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
tool is you don't have to go to the hex

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.240 
tool is you don't have to go to the hex
trying<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.750> find<00:02:49.079> all<00:02:49.439> of<00:02:49.519> these<00:02:50.659> stupid

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
trying to find all of these stupid

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.420 
trying to find all of these stupid
patterns<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.709> find<00:02:55.919> it<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.250> way

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
patterns and you know find it that way

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.009 
patterns and you know find it that way
so<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.969> got<00:02:57.919> 1492<00:03:00.049> 609<00:03:01.049> 1492<00:03:01.769> 609<00:03:02.639> plus<00:03:03.329> 5<00:03:03.659> is

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so we got 1492 609 1492 609 plus 5 is

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.909 
so we got 1492 609 1492 609 plus 5 is
the<00:03:04.349> offset<00:03:04.769> bit<00:03:05.129> that's<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.849> right<00:03:06.000> there<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
the offset bit that's it right there and

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.949 
the offset bit that's it right there and
just<00:03:07.919> like<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.189> if<00:03:08.639> we<00:03:08.849> go<00:03:09.000> ahead<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.329> open

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
just like that if we go ahead and open

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.030 
just like that if we go ahead and open
up<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:12.169> current<00:03:13.169> roster<00:03:13.639> there<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.849> all<00:03:14.969> is<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
up the current roster there it all is it

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.229 
up the current roster there it all is it
is<00:03:17.900> beautiful<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.530> thank<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.579> left<00:03:21.060> those
