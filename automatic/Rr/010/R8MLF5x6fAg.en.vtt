00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi to all the boys one in the afternoon 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.220
 it is not water and on fire and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.800
 finally I can't back down 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.469
 from making an unboxing of the saf estro two 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
 that arrived to me this morning for the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.240
 which I thank and microsoft for having it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 sent to trial and the catto 86 86 per 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.369
 having made this possible ie for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.980
 making me have the right contacts 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.570
 then told this unboxing as al 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.130
 usually you can't get more of the albums 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.860
 singh I know but this more than a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.579
 unboxing is an unboxing but let's say it is 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 more like saying an anticipation of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.969
 what will come because not all of me 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 follow on twitter or on facebook and not 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 everyone knows that this has arrived 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.950
 surface pro because it should interest 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 because to whom interest on facebook two 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.760
 performance and all these things 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 now with this unboxing he will know that in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.410
 coming days maybe not that of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 christmas but something will come 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.010
 in conclusion 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 we open this box inside we have it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 this beautiful tablet so much that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 I wanted to try it guys then here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.460
 normally there is a tab but 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 obviously being the surface is not 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 so there is no new tab then 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.369
 let's put aside for a moment and we have it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.009
 the nib that engages 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.259
 magnetically to the side of the handbooks e 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.200
 the power supply with the attack always 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 magnetic then away 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.909
 here is the tongue I was talking about before 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 that will be to pull it out easily 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.970
 so what about the surface io 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.189
 obviously I can't do you now 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.560
 no darwin on companies because luxury 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.540
 opening at this time lasted 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.799
 so much the morning this morning 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 working because he was looking forward to 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.630
 go back home 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.549
 as we can see we have in the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 focus company of the iphone ok 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.260
 below we say the connector 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.700
 of the doc let's call it what you need it for 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.070
 in this side we have the attack for 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.360
 power is what I do not know what 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.330
 both 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.310
 then we have power button 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.679
 thrust failure ignition e 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.080
 switch off rocker headphones for the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.730
 volume and usb port fantastic thing 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.730
 on the back we have the kickstand 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.580
 which is new compared to the old surface 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.690
 because in two positions one for 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.270
 use it as a laptop then on 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.040
 desk is another for darkness 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.140
 use it you see the reflection all over 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 mess that there is on the other table 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.760
 the other position to use it 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.769
 let's say on the legs and say on the sofa 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.709
 and on the legs to understand a little 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.720
 size of this surface 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.690
 let's see if we can do that with this 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.440
 macbook pro 13 therefore much smaller 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 and we can do even a moment of 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.040
 comparison even if there is custody 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.590
 set up with an ipad the year 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.840
 and here we come that there is already a beauty 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.260
 difference because or one but neither 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 so much because to calculate the coffee it a 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.880
 sixteen noni ratio is therefore 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.579
 normal that it is longer though not 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.239
 it is narrower because it is no longer 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.100
 wide 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.040
 that is, from the height we say so I am 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.910
 stumbling that we actually are 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.640
 there 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.560
 this however is seen from the side however vi 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.790
 I repeat, don't let me take off from 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.220
 live custody of 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.480
 because you know that is thinner than 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.820
 which is perhaps more interesting to see 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 the surface rt this is the first on face 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.880
 networks as it changes and does not change one 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.760
 comma if not in thickness and weight because 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.609
 the exact same size 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.450
 but obviously the surface 2 pro 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.210
 remember that the pro is much more double 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.760
 and above all it weighs 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.760
 significantly more than this here then 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.510
 they sent me have me to me 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.510
 have sent I also show one 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.900
 cover surface cover due the one with i 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.180
 keys though is a patch weighing here is one 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.610
 touch cover that I don't like then 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.550
 I wo n't use it and I'll try this instead 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.320
 is my beautiful type cover that 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.970
 the one with the physical keys and asks for one 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.880
 of the most comfortable keyboards I ever have 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.050
 used is already so obviously compatible 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.100
 this is the first version there is also one 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.750
 second version with keys 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.760
 backlit, etc. etc. 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.990
 I say and I do n't give a damn but how 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 you can see it's perfectly 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:30.340
 compatible with the old model 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.860
 let's say d type cover so great e 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.420
 no kids obviously in the next 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.970
 days will come tests either 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.230
 concerning of course if you follow me up 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.050
 twitter facebook you will surely have 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.570
 some anticipation at the text level 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.520
 written but then the videos will arrive for 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.930
 regarding performance e 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.610
 especially with regards to the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.790
 gaming that is the thing that interests me about 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.620
 the 64 version has helped me the most 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.580
 gb that should be written by some 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.140
 back part 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.120
 if I can do it here 64gb and that's it 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.980
 a bit small though obviously for a 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.900
 text is more than enough 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:12.820
 the available cuts are 64 and 128 with 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:16.390
 4gb of ram instead from 22 56 upwards then 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:20.100
 256 516 to 8 GB of ram installed 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.140
 obviously it's a product we don't say 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.940
 upgradable therefore not modifiable 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.620
 rambo etcetera etc. ssd so if 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.240
 you have to choose it you have to choose well 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.550
 what we're going to see e 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.770
 especially if it overheats if it has 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.080
 good performance calculated than to 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.450
 chipset password in then it should 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.310
 I have more or less more or less stress 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.710
 more or less the performance of the match of 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.650
 my macbook air 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.090
 16 so I shouldn't be bad on the contrary 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.460
 I should find myself very well also because 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.740
 I love this product I love it 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.720
 always said and for me it is a great one 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.100
 solution to take me around for 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.980
 to play with it etc. etc. also because 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.860
 this attached with the mouse attacking us 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.120
 the USB mouse you have practically a PC 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.530
 because this is the truth 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.120
 I assure you that the keyboard is 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.700
 one of the best things that is very comfortable 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.170
 i ever found anything i missed 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.740
 too much in chatter 15 we see i 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.740
 next videos
