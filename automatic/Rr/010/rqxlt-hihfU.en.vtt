 jonathan álvaro crowned alan josué 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.990
 Andres Alejandro Rivero erwin ramirez 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 caldera and sebastián castella a strong 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.780
 hug for them and many greetings let's go 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.510
 to watch the video 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.240
 well now I have here the suckers with 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.060
 those that stick to the glass and you can 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.100
 grab here the little manguerita from the air of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.620
 the aquariums then let's put 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.850
 these suckers to accommodate those 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.220
 mangueritas that we see there in the aquarium 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.680
 they are there this 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.960
 without order we will try to accommodate the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.890
 to see how we can accommodate them 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.899
 well there we can see the stone diffuser 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 that is blowing bubbles here goes the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.990
 manguerita here place a suction cup in 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.400
 the bottom of the aquarium 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.260
 there is more or less you can see 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.760
 is a little bit still the water because it 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.790
 rummaged right now that I started to move it 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 pebble here is another sucker on the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 glass here we have another 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.780
 and here already on the surface outside already 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.120
 we have another sucker with what a two 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 three four suckers 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.900
 to accommodate that little hose and you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 you will be able to accommodate the hoses as best 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 stay in your aquarium remember that for 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.390
 do these procedures you should always 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.780
 to disconnect all accessories 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.300
 electric mail like the filter 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 more if it's an internal filter, you have to 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.870
 disconnect it from the electric current 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 and the heater because as we will 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.670
 introduce your hands to the water because you do not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.710
 I'm going to give an electric shock that is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 something that should not happen but it's better 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.540
 for security, well I will replace 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.640
 also a diffusing stone that had been 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.420
 broken in the aquarium I already have here the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.980
 new as they had been shown in the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.110
 video where I went shopping for the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.850
 aquarium and I also tell them how much it cost 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.860
 This stone is very easy to place 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.710
 just in this tube that has 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.570
 here we are going to place the little hose 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.160
 that comes from the air pump there are many 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.760
 that here they place a valve of no 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.800
 return so that the water does not return to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
 the pump when the power goes 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910
 electric, let's see if on another occasion 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 I can buy a valve of those 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.420
 to see how the good work we 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 to place this diffusing stone 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 there we can see how the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.900
 stone diffuser in the hose very 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.130
 simple nothing else you introduce it without using 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.160
 a lot of strength 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.959
 nothing else something that comes easily and 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.310
 let's submerge now and we're also going to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.430
 accommodate this little hose with its 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.220
 suckers there we can already see the stone 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.890
 new diffuser already working nothing more 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.450
 that on this side the air outlet as 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.150
 that lacks a little bit of power 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.650
 I have to check the bomb 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.920
 that's why I also bought the spare parts 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.040
 for the pump and we can see there back it's going 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.720
 he had with his suckers has been placed 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.120
 in a very easy way here as we see 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.220
 the hoses around the aquarium to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.239
 that no longer walk there are loose and 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.160
 they see ugly I'm just going to cover the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.470
 stone with the stone diffuser with the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.230
 more gravel of the aquarium and we finished the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.150
 today's work 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.099
 good as we can see also in the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.940
 aquarium of the blows and I put there the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.849
 suction cups and we can see a suction cup is not 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.620
 that you go through the fish a lot 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.590
 I put also in the suckers to 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.240
 hold it 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.280
 the manguerita 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.130
 these suction cups are very good there 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.990
 stuck in the glass of the aquarium 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.100
 and we see how it goes and there is the stone 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.440
 diffuser 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.750
 so good to have this a little bit 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.000
 more ordered our aquariums well with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.770
 those little suckers that well 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.510
 it occurs to me to put some suckers to 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.890
 the cables of the heaters so that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.890
 everything looks nicer 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.130
 well already with the aquarium a little more 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.860
 clean everything that had been done 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.890
 removed from the fund because we can see 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.240
 again in the hoses with their 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.690
 suckers as they are accommodated 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.610
 behind 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.410
 good here the desire to know very well 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.870
 but there is about the manguerita 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.280
 there it is as daddy is with his with his 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.980
 suction cups 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 it's a very practical way of accommodating 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.350
 the hoses so they are not there 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.180
 floating and that look more 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.550
 I recommend you if you do not have these 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.800
 small suckers 8 points 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.380
 or you can get them to accommodate your 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.270
 command to be edited in the aquarium 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.180
 Air hoses are very good these 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.100
 very economical suction cups 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.120
 I already showed them to me in the video where 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.320
 I went shopping 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.090
 for the aquarium 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.470
