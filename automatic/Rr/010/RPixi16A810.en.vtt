00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
a push but we're going to assume it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.450 
a push but we're going to assume it
travels<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> number<00:01:28.590> let's<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.040> say<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
travels to a number let's just say it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
travels to a number let's just say it
goes<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.659> 6<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> comes<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
goes to a 6 so it comes up here to the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.950 
goes to a 6 so it comes up here to the
dumps<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> lay<00:01:36.210> odds<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.780> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
dumps and now you want to lay odds in it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
dumps and now you want to lay odds in it
again<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.880> office

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
again it would be just like the office

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.050 
again it would be just like the office
in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> past<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.500> lay<00:01:40.770> six<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.909> get

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
in the past you're gonna lay six to get

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.929 
in the past you're gonna lay six to get
paid<00:01:42.329> five<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.320> max<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.220> let<00:01:44.909> me

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
paid five this is max here so let me

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.770 
paid five this is max here so let me
just<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> up

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just back this up

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.460 
just back this up
let's<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.140> six<00:01:46.409> dollars<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.350> this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
let's put six dollars there so in this

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you're standing as opposed to the dump

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.250 
you're standing as opposed to the dump
comes<00:02:46.670> they<00:02:47.150> come<00:02:47.690> back<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.110> because

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
comes they come back here because

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.710 
comes they come back here because
because<00:02:48.650> there's<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.860> lot<00:02:49.010> more<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:50.120> players<00:02:50.420> on

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
because there's a lot more do players on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.270 
because there's a lot more do players on
the<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:50.960> side<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.320> game<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:52.040> on<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
the right side of the game then on the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.950 
the right side of the game then on the
wrong<00:02:52.460> side<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> game<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.420> area<00:02:53.780> back

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
wrong side of the game so the area back

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.590 
wrong side of the game so the area back
here<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> lot<00:02:54.560> smaller<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.880> if<00:02:56.000> everybody

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
here is a lot smaller so if everybody

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.940 
here is a lot smaller so if everybody
was<00:02:56.750> playing<00:02:56.960> dump<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.470> would<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.770> very

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
was playing dump this would be very

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.730 
was playing dump this would be very
congested<00:02:58.430> back<00:02:58.790> here<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.320> dump<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
congested back here so the dump the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.770 
congested back here so the dump the
dumps<00:03:01.010> are<00:03:01.100> back<00:03:01.220> here<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.180> dues<00:03:02.390> are<00:03:02.660> up

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
dumps are back here and the dues are up

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.090 
dumps are back here and the dues are up
