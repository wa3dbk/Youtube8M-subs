over<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.670> strings<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.330> just<00:01:22.479> creates

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780

whammy and then that leads into the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
whammy and then that leads into the
three<00:02:18.720> palm<00:02:18.960> unities<00:02:20.660> by<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.720> way<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:21.930> using

power<00:03:44.730> cords<00:03:45.060> quick<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.870> going<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.050> be<00:03:46.170> a

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
power cords quick this is going to be a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.140 
power cords quick this is going to be a
good<00:03:46.470> thing<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> work<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.520> for<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.910> because

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
good thing to work on for that because

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.580 
good thing to work on for that because
people<00:03:48.510> do<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.660> trouble<00:03:49.080> with<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.440> an

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
people do have trouble with it like an

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.350 
people do have trouble with it like an

cords back and forth it's basically the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.230 
cords back and forth it's basically the
last<00:03:55.410> three<00:03:55.650> chords<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.980> played<00:03:56.240> descending

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
last three chords you played descending
