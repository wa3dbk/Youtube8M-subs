unreliable<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.420> opinion<00:01:07.490> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
unreliable in my in my opinion it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.680 
unreliable in my in my opinion it
depends<00:01:08.940> where<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.149> hid<00:01:09.270> them<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> body

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
depends where you hid them in the body

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.120 
depends where you hid them in the body
because<00:01:09.810> sometimes<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> could<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.950> hit

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because sometimes it could be one hit

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.180 
because sometimes it could be one hit
one<00:01:11.729> hit<00:01:11.940> kill<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.509> other<00:01:13.410> times<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
one hit kill and other times it can be

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.740 
one hit kill and other times it can be
which<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.300> have<00:01:15.539> experienced<00:01:16.320> unfortunately

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
which I have experienced unfortunately

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.109 
which I have experienced unfortunately
and<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.410> life<00:01:19.649> or<00:01:19.800> death

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
and that can actually be life or death

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.740 
and that can actually be life or death
so<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.300> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> CFTC<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:23.670> radar<00:01:24.090> guns<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> f5

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
so here at the CFTC we radar guns and f5

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
so here at the CFTC we radar guns and f5
so<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.050> scoring<00:01:25.320> system<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.800> five<00:01:26.130> different

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so our scoring system in five different

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.510 
so our scoring system in five different
categories<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:28.709> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.039> do<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
categories and I'm also going to do the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
categories and I'm also going to do the
my<00:01:30.090> grade<00:01:30.360> too<00:01:30.800> ok<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.069> category<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> our

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
my grade too ok so the category is our

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.320 
my grade too ok so the category is our
power<00:01:33.500> maneuverability<00:01:34.610> accuracy<00:01:35.610> rate<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
power maneuverability accuracy rate of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.870 
power maneuverability accuracy rate of
fire<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.899> ammo<00:01:37.709> /<00:01:38.100> reload<00:01:38.490> rate<00:01:40.130> alright<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fire and ammo / reload rate alright so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.010 
fire and ammo / reload rate alright so
the<00:01:42.810> power<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.200> gun<00:01:43.380> sniper<00:01:43.860> rifle<00:01:45.020> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the power on this gun sniper rifle you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.839 
the power on this gun sniper rifle you
know<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.880> expect<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.569> too<00:01:48.750> weak<00:01:49.849> it

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
know can can expect it to be too weak it

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.660 
know can can expect it to be too weak it
it<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.840> definitely<00:01:52.289> be<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.770> one-hit<00:01:53.009> body<00:01:53.369> shot

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it can definitely be a one-hit body shot

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.580 
it can definitely be a one-hit body shot
which<00:01:55.340> which<00:01:56.340> makes<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:56.670> gun<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.119> great

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
which which makes this gun really great

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.900 
which which makes this gun really great
but<00:01:59.990> most<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> time<00:02:01.349> it's<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
but most of the time it's it can be to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.570 
but most of the time it's it can be to
like<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> i've<00:02:03.959> hit<00:02:04.229> some<00:02:04.410> people<00:02:04.530> low<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
like it i've hit some people low in the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.609 
like it i've hit some people low in the
chest<00:02:05.789> like<00:02:06.119> low<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> body<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
chest like low in the body and it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.400 
chest like low in the body and it
counted<00:02:08.099> as<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.849> 96<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:10.170> around

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
counted as a like 96 or some around

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.190 
counted as a like 96 or some around
there<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.790> i'm<00:02:12.390> still<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> give<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> 5

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
there so i'm still going to give it a 5

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.130 
there so i'm still going to give it a 5
because<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:14.540> pretty<00:02:15.540> dependable<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.050> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
because it's pretty dependable if you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.640 
because it's pretty dependable if you
hit<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:16.530> spot<00:02:18.650> maneuverability

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
hit it in the right spot maneuverability

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.800 
hit it in the right spot maneuverability
this<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> sniper<00:02:20.910> rifle<00:02:21.270> obviously

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
this thing is a sniper rifle obviously

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.300 
this thing is a sniper rifle obviously
can't<00:02:22.050> expect<00:02:22.410> too<00:02:22.530> much<00:02:22.680> from<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:23.040> so

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
can't expect too much from it so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.990 
can't expect too much from it so
obviously<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
obviously going to get to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.569 
obviously going to get to
um<00:02:28.000> rate<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.930> fire<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:30.040> gun<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.879> no<00:02:31.090> means

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579

anyone's<00:02:58.690> ever<00:02:58.870> used<00:02:59.170> this<00:02:59.379> and<00:02:59.709> realize<00:03:00.190> that

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
anyone's ever used this and realize that

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.520 
anyone's ever used this and realize that
but<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.329> really<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.659> in<00:03:01.780> his<00:03:01.900> accurately<00:03:02.290> if

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
but it really is in his accurately if

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.050 
but it really is in his accurately if
you've<00:03:02.889> used<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.250> aam<00:03:03.400> first<00:03:03.700> then<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you've used the aam first then the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.890 
you've used the aam first then the
dragunov<00:03:05.129> um<00:03:07.379> mo<00:03:08.379> how<00:03:09.159> this<00:03:09.489> gun<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:10.030> average

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
dragunov um mo how this gun is average

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.140 
dragunov um mo how this gun is average
he<00:03:11.139> comes<00:03:11.379> with<00:03:11.680> 5<00:03:11.950> out<00:03:12.129> of<00:03:12.159> 30<00:03:12.430> that's<00:03:12.849> what

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
he comes with 5 out of 30 that's what

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.080 
he comes with 5 out of 30 that's what
the<00:03:13.540> harm<00:03:13.720> comes<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.579> which<00:03:15.579> makes<00:03:15.909> it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
the harm comes with which makes it

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.460 
the harm comes with which makes it
obviously<00:03:16.659> average<00:03:17.019> um<00:03:18.480> thus<00:03:19.480> giving<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.260> 3

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
obviously average um thus giving it a 3

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.210 
obviously average um thus giving it a 3
out<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> 5<00:03:21.269> mm<00:03:23.370> alright<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.349> grade<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.069> it

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
out of 5 mm alright so the grade that it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:37.890 
out of 5 mm alright so the grade that it
gets<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.389> 15<00:03:29.349> out<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.239> 25<00:03:32.069> which<00:03:36.720> that's<00:03:37.720> a

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
gets is a 15 out of 25 which that's a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.960 
gets is a 15 out of 25 which that's a
sixty<00:03:38.230> percent<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:41.079> it's<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.699> of<00:03:42.760> bad<00:03:42.909> for

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
sixty percent it's it's kind of bad for

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.960 
sixty percent it's it's kind of bad for
a<00:03:43.359> sniper<00:03:43.629> rifle<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.519> fun<00:03:45.760> when

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
a sniper rifle but it's really fun when

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.330 
a sniper rifle but it's really fun when
he<00:03:46.150> hit<00:03:46.419> no<00:03:46.599> scopes<00:03:46.659> on<00:03:47.109> people<00:03:47.470> with<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.739> I

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
he hit no scopes on people with this I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.640 
he hit no scopes on people with this I
was<00:03:49.209> trying<00:03:49.389> my<00:03:49.690> hardest<00:03:49.870> he<00:03:50.260> had<00:03:50.379> a<00:03:50.409> bunch<00:03:50.560> of

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
was trying my hardest he had a bunch of

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.710 
was trying my hardest he had a bunch of
no<00:03:50.769> scopes<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.400> video<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.819> think<00:03:52.569> it's

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
no scopes of this video I think it's

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.180 
no scopes of this video I think it's
really<00:03:52.989> fun<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.849> um<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.680> said<00:03:56.859> I'm<00:03:56.949> gonna<00:03:57.099> do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
really fun but um as I said I'm gonna do

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.819 
really fun but um as I said I'm gonna do
my<00:03:57.370> own<00:03:57.400> grade<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:59.010> my<00:04:00.010> grade<00:04:00.280> for<00:04:00.579> this<00:04:00.669> gun

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
my own grade and my grade for this gun

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.149 
my own grade and my grade for this gun
WC<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.750> really<00:04:05.049> doesn't<00:04:05.470> deserve<00:04:05.769> anything

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
WC it really doesn't deserve anything

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.789 
WC it really doesn't deserve anything
higher<00:04:06.459> or<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.989> casing<00:04:08.409> anything<00:04:08.979> lower

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
higher or in that casing anything lower

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.500 
higher or in that casing anything lower
so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.110 

exactly<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.769> think<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.549> think<00:04:16.579> that's<00:04:16.970> what

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
exactly I think it I think that's what

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.370 
exactly I think it I think that's what
it<00:04:17.239> deserves<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.720> don't<00:04:17.870> know<00:04:17.930> tell<00:04:18.199> me<00:04:18.290> I'm
