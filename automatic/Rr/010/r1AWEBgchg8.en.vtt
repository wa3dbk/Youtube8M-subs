00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.220
 the filing of threads is really 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:14.340
 no witchcraft so needed for one 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:23.570
 tip want needle so something so pointy 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:23.570
 tip big you miss the thread 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 therefore you should be at the beginning and at the end 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 knit it about 20 cm 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.480
 Leave 20 to 30 cm long thread 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 and I would be here from the corner 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.250
 reason so in the diagonal by 56 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.050
 pierce stitches on the back 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 It is important that you are always in the middle 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 through the threads it stands out 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.210
 really well hooked into one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 Direction just the needle 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.399
 piercing through the thread 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 wear a little but be careful that should 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.229
 do not contract the strictly piece 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 so again in the opposite direction 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 a bit on the front 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.520
 Of course, you should not see and then 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 at the same places again 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.580
 put back and go right through 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 through the threads through the stitches 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.130
 pierce then hooks itself completely 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.570
 very firm and secure with each other and me 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.180
 then always do it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.299
 third time and always make sure that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 you do not pull this sect together 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.810
 always a little later 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.689
 third time through the same stitches 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 back sting again across the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.460
 thread should compensate for a bit 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.790
 now you are allowed the thread very close 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.189
 cut off and that will bomb 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.969
 hold tight 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.710
 Of course she is on the front page 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.340
 none of it 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.890
 you would have it instead of diagonal, too 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 along the edge you would also have the edge 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.650
 can use for sewing so 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.040
 diagonal or the edge benefit that is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.040
 a matter of taste
