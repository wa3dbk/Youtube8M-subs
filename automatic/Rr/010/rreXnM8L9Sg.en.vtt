Porsche 996 c4 so the the old wheel
drive<00:00:13.910> model<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:15.230> first<00:00:15.860> water-cooled<00:00:17.410> 911

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
drive model the first water-cooled 911

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.160 
drive model the first water-cooled 911
so<00:00:18.680> you<00:00:18.740> know<00:00:19.039> all<00:00:19.280> 911<00:00:19.820> is<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:19.940> rear<00:00:20.150> engine<00:00:20.420> you

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
so you know all 911 is a rear engine you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.140 
so you know all 911 is a rear engine you
can<00:00:21.320> see<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.590> engine<00:00:22.010> right<00:00:22.790> here<00:00:23.000> at<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
can see the engine right here at the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.210 
can see the engine right here at the
back<00:00:23.270> of<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.570> car<00:00:23.810> with<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.110> headers<00:00:24.380> coming

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
back of the car with the headers coming

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.370 
back of the car with the headers coming
off<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.730> then<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.270> headers<00:00:26.570> kind<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.900> loop

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
off and then the headers kind of loop

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.870 
off and then the headers kind of loop
around<00:00:27.530> to<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.830> cats<00:00:28.100> right<00:00:28.430> behind<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.730> rear

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
around to the cats right behind the rear

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.850 
around to the cats right behind the rear
bumper<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.870> then<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.080> goes<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.500> criss

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
bumper and then it goes to the criss

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.950 
bumper and then it goes to the criss
cross<00:00:31.100> it<00:00:31.370> goes<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> mufflers<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.480> then

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
cross it goes to the mufflers and then

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.799 
cross it goes to the mufflers and then
it<00:00:33.050> comes<00:00:33.290> out<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.920> tailpipes<00:00:34.570> but<00:00:35.570> one<00:00:35.780> of

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
it comes out the tailpipes but one of

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.349 
it comes out the tailpipes but one of
the<00:00:36.019> things<00:00:36.260> 911<00:00:36.829> is<00:00:36.920> known<00:00:37.129> for<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.940> addition

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
the things 911 is known for in addition

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.880 
the things 911 is known for in addition
to<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:38.570> rear<00:00:38.749> engine<00:00:39.199> as<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.350> engines<00:00:39.679> very

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
to that rear engine as the engines very

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.790 
to that rear engine as the engines very
low<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:40.789> know<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.269> cylinder<00:00:41.719> heads<00:00:42.530> are

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
low so you know the cylinder heads are

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.610 
low so you know the cylinder heads are
just<00:00:42.980> right<00:00:43.249> here<00:00:43.699> right<00:00:44.239> next<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.839> to<00:00:45.469> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
just right here right next to the to the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.459 
just right here right next to the to the
rear<00:00:46.100> wheels<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.719> engine<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.050> completely

engine is mounted to a transmission
which<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.359> right<00:00:53.690> here<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.409> can<00:00:54.530> see<00:00:54.829> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
which is right here and you can see the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.270 
which is right here and you can see the
the<00:00:55.489> drive<00:00:55.760> shafts<00:00:56.089> coming<00:00:57.079> off<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:58.100> each

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
the drive shafts coming off to to each

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.729 
the drive shafts coming off to to each
rear<00:00:58.550> wheel<00:00:58.819> right<00:00:59.510> behind<00:00:59.719> that<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.350> brace

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
rear wheel right behind that that brace

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.129 
rear wheel right behind that that brace
there<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.249> can<00:01:01.370> see<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.639> boots<00:01:01.879> there<00:01:02.179> and<00:01:03.019> it

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
there you can see the boots there and it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.500 
there you can see the boots there and it
goes<00:01:03.319> out<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.040> rear<00:01:04.190> wheel<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.360> rear

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
goes out to the rear wheel and the rear

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.660 
goes out to the rear wheel and the rear
suspension<00:01:05.690> it's<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.770> pretty<00:01:07.310> good<00:01:07.520> design

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
suspension it's a pretty good design

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.389 
suspension it's a pretty good design
I'll<00:01:08.390> take<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.659> another<00:01:09.320> look<00:01:09.860> around<00:01:09.890> here

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
I'll take a another look around here

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.670 
I'll take a another look around here
this<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:11.060> probably<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.450> best<00:01:11.659> view<00:01:12.020> it's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
this is probably the best view it's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.910 
this is probably the best view it's
really<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:14.899> double<00:01:15.320> double

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
really a you know a double double

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.270 
really a you know a double double
control<00:01:16.189> arm<00:01:16.340> double<00:01:16.579> wishbone<00:01:16.969> type<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:18.280> it's

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
control arm double wishbone type of it's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.620 
control arm double wishbone type of it's
especially<00:01:19.670> not<00:01:19.729> quite<00:01:20.000> double<00:01:20.240> wishbone

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
especially not quite double wishbone

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.999 
especially not quite double wishbone
because<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.020> upper<00:01:21.259> links<00:01:21.590> are<00:01:21.680> separate

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
because the upper links are separate

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.069 
because the upper links are separate
links<00:01:22.340> there's<00:01:23.030> two<00:01:23.180> upper<00:01:23.570> links<00:01:23.869> there<00:01:24.049> that

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
links there's two upper links there that

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.990 
links there's two upper links there that
connect<00:01:24.469> to<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.130> chassis<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.850> have

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
connect to the to the chassis and have

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.209 
connect to the to the chassis and have
full<00:01:26.210> joints<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:27.289> go<00:01:27.469> to<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.740> wheel<00:01:27.890> carrier

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
full joints that go to the wheel carrier

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.569 
full joints that go to the wheel carrier
and<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:29.659> bottom<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.740> control<00:01:31.310> arm

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
and then the bottom is a control arm

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.819 
and then the bottom is a control arm
within<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.240> diagonal<00:01:32.810> brace<00:01:33.109> that<00:01:33.469> that

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
within this diagonal brace that that

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.550 
within this diagonal brace that that
goes<00:01:34.039> forward<00:01:34.460> but<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:35.539> idea<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.930> is<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.469> know

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
goes forward but the idea is is you know

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.090 
goes forward but the idea is is you know
it<00:01:36.710> really<00:01:36.950> keeps<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.359> wheel<00:01:38.590> street<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
it really keeps the the wheel street to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.330 
it really keeps the the wheel street to
the<00:01:40.250> road<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.450> suspension<00:01:42.200> goes<00:01:42.979> up<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the road as the suspension goes up and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.419 
the road as the suspension goes up and
down<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:43.729> then<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:44.930> um<00:01:45.200> an<00:01:45.740> aluminum<00:01:46.189> bar

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
down and then there's um an aluminum bar

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.240 
down and then there's um an aluminum bar
right<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.299> at<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.780> back<00:01:47.990> right<00:01:48.890> behind<00:01:49.130> that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
right here at the back right behind that

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.310 
right here at the back right behind that
hooked<00:01:49.579> sway<00:01:49.939> bar<00:01:50.179> this<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.570> called<00:01:50.899> your<00:01:51.020> tow

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
hooked sway bar this is called your tow

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.429 
hooked sway bar this is called your tow
link<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.979> what<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.369> is<00:01:52.549> is<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.969> is<00:01:53.719> how<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
link and what it is is it is how you

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.919 
link and what it is is it is how you
know<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:55.250> keeps<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.149> carrier<00:01:56.689> from

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
know it it keeps the carrier from

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.099 
know it it keeps the carrier from
turning<00:01:57.710> like<00:01:57.859> steering<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:59.270> just<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.539> fixed

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.279 
turning like steering it's just a fixed
link<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.369> look<00:02:01.640> right<00:02:01.999> here<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.749> can

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
link and if you look right here you can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.739 
link and if you look right here you can
actually<00:02:03.619> see<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.859> little<00:02:04.039> calibrated<00:02:04.969> bolt

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
actually see a little calibrated bolt

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.899 
actually see a little calibrated bolt
with<00:02:06.109> kind<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.619> an<00:02:06.740> offset<00:02:06.920> washer<00:02:07.609> attached

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
with kind of an offset washer attached

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.820 
with kind of an offset washer attached
to<00:02:08.149> its<00:02:08.270> really<00:02:08.539> kind<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.869> cam<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.679> you

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
to its really kind of a cam and you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.230 
to its really kind of a cam and you
loosen<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> nut<00:02:10.429> up<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.820> other<00:02:10.910> side<00:02:11.210> of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
loosen the nut up on the other side of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.570 
loosen the nut up on the other side of
when<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> turn<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.680> an<00:02:12.830> eccentric<00:02:13.280> so

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
when you turn that it's an eccentric so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.949 
when you turn that it's an eccentric so
it<00:02:13.670> means<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> center<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> bolt<00:02:14.780> is

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
it means that the center of the bolt is

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.809 
it means that the center of the bolt is
off-center<00:02:15.290> from<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
off-center from the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.759 
off-center from the
and<00:02:15.939> so<00:02:16.599> when<00:02:16.749> you<00:02:16.810> turn<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.170> bolt<00:02:17.439> it's

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and so when you turn that bolt it's

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.280 
and so when you turn that bolt it's
going<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.189> push<00:02:18.519> or<00:02:18.760> pull<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.390> tow<00:02:19.719> link<00:02:20.049> in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
going to push or pull that tow link in

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to push or pull that tow link in
or<00:02:20.439> out<00:02:20.620> which<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.519> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.969> give<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.659> tow<00:02:22.930> at

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
or out which is going to give you tow at

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.069 
or out which is going to give you tow at
the<00:02:23.889> rear<00:02:24.189> wheel<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.730> then<00:02:25.689> you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.900> see

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
the rear wheel and then you can see

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.959 
the rear wheel and then you can see
right<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.590> we've<00:02:27.280> got<00:02:27.340> another<00:02:27.639> one<00:02:27.730> of

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
right here we've got another one of

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.479 
right here we've got another one of
those<00:02:28.060> adjustments<00:02:28.749> and<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:30.219> the

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
those adjustments and this is for the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.699 
those adjustments and this is for the
lower<00:02:31.180> control<00:02:31.629> arm<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.290> when<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.530> lower

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
lower control arm so when the lower

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
lower control arm so when the lower
control<00:02:33.069> arm<00:02:33.340> pushes<00:02:33.790> outward<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.900> gives<00:02:35.139> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
control arm pushes outward it gives the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.349 
control arm pushes outward it gives the
car<00:02:35.469> more<00:02:35.709> negative<00:02:36.159> camber<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> rear<00:02:36.939> and

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
car more negative camber in the rear and

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.179 
car more negative camber in the rear and
when<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.569> pulls<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.959> word<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.739> gives<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.040> less

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
when it pulls in word it gives you less

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.830 
when it pulls in word it gives you less
negative<00:02:39.459> camber<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.359> those<00:02:40.569> are<00:02:40.689> your<00:02:40.780> two

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
negative camber so those are your two

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.979 
negative camber so those are your two
alignment<00:02:41.680> settings<00:02:41.919> in<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.250> rear<00:02:42.430> your<00:02:43.329> toe

in<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.620> camber<00:02:45.159> adjustment<00:02:45.719> you<00:02:46.719> know

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
in your camber adjustment you know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.869 
in your camber adjustment you know
there's<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.200> sway<00:02:47.650> bar<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:48.069> black<00:02:48.280> bar<00:02:48.579> there

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
there's the sway bar the black bar there

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.390 
there's the sway bar the black bar there
that's<00:02:49.569> connecting<00:02:50.049> from<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> drop<00:02:50.859> link<00:02:51.069> to

c4 model I'm not quite sure how visible
it<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:20.799> there's<00:03:20.949> actually<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.280> driveshaft

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it is but there's actually a driveshaft

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.749 
it is but there's actually a driveshaft
there's<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.870> rubber<00:03:23.169> kind<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:24.069> doughnut

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:24.759 
there's a rubber kind of doughnut

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.780 
there's a rubber kind of doughnut
bushing<00:03:25.659> between<00:03:26.229> a<00:03:26.470> part<00:03:27.189> that's<00:03:27.280> coming<00:03:27.639> out

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
bushing between a part that's coming out

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.490 
bushing between a part that's coming out
on<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.329> front<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.689> transmission<00:03:29.169> and

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
on the front of the transmission and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.369 
on the front of the transmission and
this<00:03:30.159> black<00:03:30.489> driveshaft<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.689> maybe<00:03:32.139> here's

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
this black driveshaft here maybe here's

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.469 
this black driveshaft here maybe here's
another<00:03:32.590> view<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:35.709> drive<00:03:36.069> shaft

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
another view so this drive shaft

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.289 
another view so this drive shaft
transmits<00:03:37.479> the<00:03:37.629> power<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.439> a<00:03:38.470> front<00:03:39.159> a<00:03:39.400> little

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
transmits the power to a front a little

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.249 
transmits the power to a front a little
front<00:03:40.509> differential

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:41.259 
front differential

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.699 
front differential
that's<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:42.479> shiny<00:03:43.479> aluminum<00:03:43.989> looking<00:03:44.470> thing

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
that's this shiny aluminum looking thing

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.280 
that's this shiny aluminum looking thing
actually<00:03:45.040> there's<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.400> viscous<00:03:45.879> coupling

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
actually there's a viscous coupling

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.319 
actually there's a viscous coupling
right<00:03:47.290> here<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:47.979> housing<00:03:48.729> part<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.180> it

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
right here in that housing part of it

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.330 
right here in that housing part of it
and<00:03:49.449> that<00:03:49.509> viscous<00:03:50.349> coupling<00:03:50.620> allows<00:03:51.009> for<00:03:51.310> a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and that viscous coupling allows for a

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.580 
and that viscous coupling allows for a
little<00:03:51.400> bit<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.669> slip<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.150> think<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.870> Porsche

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
little bit of slip I think the Porsche

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.670 
little bit of slip I think the Porsche
factory<00:03:53.829> said<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.959> 85%<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.109> power<00:03:56.319> goes

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
factory said that 85% of the power goes

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.069 
factory said that 85% of the power goes
to<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.859> rear<00:03:56.949> wheels<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:57.970> 15<00:03:58.629> goes<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> the

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
to the rear wheels and 15 goes to the

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.619 
to the rear wheels and 15 goes to the
front<00:03:59.290> or<00:03:59.590> 70<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.069> five<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.669> 25<00:04:01.120> something

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
front or 70 and five and 25 something

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.899 
front or 70 and five and 25 something
like<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.199> so<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.889> not<00:04:03.040> quite<00:04:03.250> four-wheel

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
like that so it's not quite four-wheel

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.659 
like that so it's not quite four-wheel
drive<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.599> like<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> Jeep<00:04:05.919> is<00:04:06.099> or<00:04:06.250> something

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
drive like a like a Jeep is or something

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.729 
drive like a like a Jeep is or something
but<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:07.359> certainly<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:08.169> certainly<00:04:08.530> does

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
but it can certainly it certainly does

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.999 
but it can certainly it certainly does
send<00:04:09.040> some<00:04:09.669> power<00:04:09.969> to<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.269> front<00:04:10.419> wheels<00:04:11.009> and

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:12.009 
send some power to the front wheels and

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.860 
send some power to the front wheels and
then<00:04:12.129> this<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> front<00:04:12.729> differential<00:04:13.120> up

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
then this is the front differential up

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.240 
then this is the front differential up
in<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.109> front<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.439> you<00:04:14.530> can<00:04:14.650> see<00:04:14.769> your<00:04:14.919> CV

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
in the front and you can see your CV

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.819 
in the front and you can see your CV
joints<00:04:15.639> and<00:04:15.819> axles<00:04:16.719> you<00:04:17.199> know<00:04:17.320> connecting

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
joints and axles you know connecting

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.890 
joints and axles you know connecting
there<00:04:18.099> and<00:04:18.729> they<00:04:18.880> connect<00:04:19.180> right<00:04:19.359> out<00:04:19.509> to<00:04:19.719> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
there and they connect right out to the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.540 
there and they connect right out to the
front<00:04:20.019> wheels<00:04:20.469> and<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:24.039> know<00:04:24.130> kind<00:04:24.340> of

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
front wheels and then you know kind of

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.269 
front wheels and then you know kind of
right<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:25.000> front<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.659> that<00:04:25.719> diff<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.889> can<00:04:27.039> see

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:27.279 
right in front of that diff you can see

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.159 
right in front of that diff you can see
that<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:28.210> unit<00:04:28.389> with<00:04:28.630> that

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
that that unit with that

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.499 
that that unit with that
accordian<00:04:29.620> boot<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.129> that<00:04:30.789> is<00:04:30.969> the<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
accordian boot on it that is the the

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.330 
accordian boot on it that is the the
power<00:04:31.689> steering<00:04:32.050> rack<00:04:32.409> so<00:04:32.919> then<00:04:33.069> the<00:04:33.189> power

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
power steering rack so then the power

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.029 
power steering rack so then the power
steering<00:04:33.789> rack<00:04:33.939> has<00:04:34.689> a<00:04:34.719> tie<00:04:35.050> rod<00:04:35.289> that<00:04:35.650> that

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
steering rack has a tie rod that that

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.550 
steering rack has a tie rod that that
goes<00:04:36.249> to<00:04:36.279> the<00:04:36.930> carrier<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.139> wheel<00:04:38.289> there

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
goes to the carrier of the wheel there

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.550 
goes to the carrier of the wheel there
and<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.629> front<00:04:40.840> suspension<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.499> a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
and then the the front suspension it's a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.550 
and then the the front suspension it's a
McPherson<00:04:42.099> strut<00:04:43.029> front<00:04:43.330> suspension<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
McPherson strut front suspension the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.760 
McPherson strut front suspension the
lower<00:04:44.800> link<00:04:45.189> is<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.610> little<00:04:45.999> similar<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.319> to

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
lower link is a little similar to the to

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.409 
lower link is a little similar to the to
the<00:04:47.860> rear<00:04:48.099> but<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.639> does<00:04:48.819> not<00:04:48.999> have<00:04:49.389> that

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
the rear but it does not have that

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.200 
the rear but it does not have that
camber<00:04:50.349> adjustment<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:51.520> actually<00:04:51.939> adjust

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
camber adjustment you actually adjust

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.450 
camber adjustment you actually adjust
the<00:04:52.300> camber<00:04:52.569> from<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.050> top<00:04:53.469> of<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.830> shock

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
the camber from the top of the shock

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.059 
the camber from the top of the shock
tower<00:04:54.759> on<00:04:54.969> this<00:04:55.150> car<00:04:55.419> which<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.409> shock<00:04:56.830> tower

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.830 
tower on this car which the shock tower
is<00:04:57.279> you<00:04:57.370> know<00:04:57.430> where<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.819> that's<00:04:58.210> strut<00:04:58.659> that

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
is you know where the that's strut that

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.070 
is you know where the that's strut that
shock<00:04:59.139> absorber<00:04:59.650> goes<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.699> up<00:05:00.879> and<00:05:01.150> under<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
shock absorber goes to up and under the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.890 
shock absorber goes to up and under the
trunk<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:03.849> know<00:05:03.969> when<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.270> tilt<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.689> top

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
trunk and you know when you tilt the top

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.510 
trunk and you know when you tilt the top
of<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.169> inward<00:05:05.349> you<00:05:05.889> get<00:05:06.099> more<00:05:06.310> negative

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
of that inward you get more negative

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.269 
of that inward you get more negative
camber<00:05:07.029> and<00:05:07.389> then<00:05:08.169> your<00:05:09.150> your<00:05:10.150> tow<00:05:10.449> is<00:05:11.129> you<00:05:12.129> can

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
camber and then your your tow is you can

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.390 
camber and then your your tow is you can
see<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.610> aluminum<00:05:13.120> kind<00:05:14.020> of<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.379> bar<00:05:15.219> going

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
see that aluminum kind of a bar going

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.149 
see that aluminum kind of a bar going
there<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:15.879> the<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.599> steering<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.499> that<00:05:17.830> I

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
there to the to the steering in that I

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.820 
there to the to the steering in that I
don't<00:05:18.819> know<00:05:19.029> if<00:05:19.150> we<00:05:19.240> can<00:05:19.360> see<00:05:19.569> it<00:05:19.659> with<00:05:19.749> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
don't know if we can see it with the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.610 
don't know if we can see it with the
cooling<00:05:20.830> duct<00:05:21.099> here<00:05:21.629> but<00:05:22.629> maybe<00:05:22.930> right<00:05:23.080> up

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
cooling duct here but maybe right up

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.869 
cooling duct here but maybe right up
through<00:05:23.860> there<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.219> can<00:05:24.370> see<00:05:24.550> it's<00:05:24.699> got<00:05:24.849> a

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
through there you can see it's got a

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.839 
through there you can see it's got a
threaded<00:05:25.330> shaft<00:05:25.569> and<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.050> jam<00:05:26.949> nut<00:05:27.039> on<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:27.400> and

threaded shaft and a jam nut on it and

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.550 
threaded shaft and a jam nut on it and
so<00:05:28.180> that's<00:05:28.300> your<00:05:28.569> adjustment<00:05:28.990> for<00:05:29.139> your<00:05:29.259> tow

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
so that's your adjustment for your tow

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.999 
so that's your adjustment for your tow
your<00:05:29.979> tow<00:05:30.219> setting<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:32.110> that's<00:05:32.349> how<00:05:32.680> you<00:05:32.740> do

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
your tow setting so that's how you do

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.559 
your tow setting so that's how you do

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:50.300 
down right here right in front of that a
kind<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.849> a<00:05:46.029> frame<00:05:46.719> member<00:05:47.939> um<00:05:48.939> and<00:05:49.330> actually

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
kind of a frame member um and actually

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.200 
kind of a frame member um and actually
while<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.490> camera<00:05:51.699> is<00:05:51.759> pointing<00:05:51.879> at<00:05:52.120> it

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
while the camera is pointing at it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.300 
while the camera is pointing at it
there's<00:05:52.360> this<00:05:52.479> black<00:05:53.050> kind<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.620> plastic<00:05:54.039> tank

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
there's this black kind of plastic tank

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.279 
there's this black kind of plastic tank
that<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.610> saddling<00:05:55.270> over<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.050> front

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
that is saddling over that front

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.920 
that is saddling over that front
differential<00:05:56.710> that's<00:05:57.189> the<00:05:57.370> gas<00:05:57.550> tank<00:05:57.939> so<00:05:58.569> the

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
differential that's the gas tank so the

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.409 
differential that's the gas tank so the
gas<00:05:59.229> tank<00:05:59.499> of<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.620> car<00:05:59.740> there's<00:06:00.610> some<00:06:01.089> covers

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
gas tank of the car there's some covers

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.420 
gas tank of the car there's some covers
and<00:06:01.629> braces<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.080> cover<00:06:02.319> all<00:06:02.649> of<00:06:03.009> this<00:06:03.129> under

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
and braces that cover all of this under

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.510 
and braces that cover all of this under
the<00:06:03.550> car<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:03.909> nothing<00:06:04.210> is<00:06:04.330> exposed<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.830> some

of the other things that we have in the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.269 
of the other things that we have in the
front<00:06:08.169> hairs<00:06:08.409> is<00:06:08.680> they're<00:06:08.919> these<00:06:09.219> little

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
front hairs is they're these little

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.600 
front hairs is they're these little
brake<00:06:09.879> cooling<00:06:10.689> ducts<00:06:11.199> air<00:06:11.589> scoops<00:06:11.949> that

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
brake cooling ducts air scoops that

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.639 
brake cooling ducts air scoops that
divert<00:06:12.999> air<00:06:13.210> coming<00:06:13.749> right<00:06:14.050> under<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.439> car

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:14.649 
divert air coming right under the car

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:16.920 
divert air coming right under the car
here<00:06:14.860> right<00:06:15.069> under<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.370> front<00:06:15.520> bumper<00:06:15.930> right

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
here right under the front bumper right

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.749 
here right under the front bumper right
to<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.229> inside<00:06:17.379> of<00:06:17.589> the<00:06:17.830> rotor<00:06:18.069> so<00:06:18.520> then<00:06:18.669> the

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
to the inside of the rotor so then the

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.010 
to the inside of the rotor so then the
air<00:06:18.849> goes<00:06:18.879> at<00:06:19.149> the<00:06:19.240> inside<00:06:19.509> of<00:06:19.599> the<00:06:19.659> roller<00:06:19.870> and

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
air goes at the inside of the roller and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.619 
air goes at the inside of the roller and
as<00:06:20.139> wheels<00:06:20.439> turns<00:06:20.919> there<00:06:21.279> goes<00:06:21.580> out<00:06:21.999> the<00:06:22.360> vents

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
as wheels turns there goes out the vents

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.769 
as wheels turns there goes out the vents
in<00:06:22.719> the<00:06:22.749> rotor<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.289> cools<00:06:23.560> off<00:06:23.889> and<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:25.449> also

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
in the rotor and cools off and you also

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.950 
in the rotor and cools off and you also
you<00:06:26.020> have<00:06:26.379> two<00:06:27.159> radiators<00:06:27.699> so<00:06:28.120> if<00:06:28.599> I<00:06:28.689> get<00:06:28.839> the

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
you have two radiators so if I get the

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.050 
you have two radiators so if I get the
camera<00:06:29.319> to<00:06:29.349> turn<00:06:29.830> around<00:06:30.069> here<00:06:30.279> need<00:06:30.819> to<00:06:30.849> see

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
camera to turn around here need to see

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.639 
camera to turn around here need to see
the<00:06:31.180> radiator<00:06:31.539> fan<00:06:31.930> here<00:06:32.319> so<00:06:32.469> there's

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:32.649 
the radiator fan here so there's

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.559 
the radiator fan here so there's
actually<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.949> radiator<00:06:33.339> and<00:06:33.639> an<00:06:33.879> AC<00:06:34.089> condenser

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:34.569 
actually a radiator and an AC condenser

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.159 
actually a radiator and an AC condenser
in<00:06:35.529> the<00:06:35.740> nose<00:06:35.949> of<00:06:36.399> the<00:06:36.550> car<00:06:36.690> right<00:06:37.690> through<00:06:37.959> the

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
in the nose of the car right through the

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.980 
in the nose of the car right through the
the<00:06:38.740> front<00:06:39.009> gun<00:06:39.219> see<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.789> AC<00:06:39.969> condenser

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
the front gun see the AC condenser

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.610 
the front gun see the AC condenser
and<00:06:41.430> these<00:06:42.430> two<00:06:42.819> great<00:06:43.300> big<00:06:43.600> pipes<00:06:44.080> that<00:06:44.560> are

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
and these two great big pipes that are

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.860 
and these two great big pipes that are
running<00:06:44.979> down<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:45.250> center<00:06:45.430> tunnel<00:06:45.970> those<00:06:46.630> are

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
running down the center tunnel those are

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.840 
running down the center tunnel those are
your<00:06:47.020> water<00:06:47.259> pipes<00:06:47.590> and<00:06:47.830> so<00:06:48.009> one<00:06:48.190> is<00:06:48.340> water<00:06:48.550> to

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
your water pipes and so one is water to

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.180 
your water pipes and so one is water to
the<00:06:48.970> radiators<00:06:49.449> and<00:06:49.690> one<00:06:50.259> is<00:06:50.349> water<00:06:50.500> back<00:06:50.889> and

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
the radiators and one is water back and

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.650 
the radiators and one is water back and
if<00:06:51.400> you<00:06:51.520> look<00:06:51.699> kind<00:06:51.940> of<00:06:52.030> right<00:06:52.180> here<00:06:52.330> next<00:06:52.509> to

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
if you look kind of right here next to

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.320 
if you look kind of right here next to
the<00:06:52.750> gas<00:06:52.960> tank<00:06:53.349> right<00:06:53.880> here<00:06:54.880> you<00:06:55.180> can<00:06:55.300> see

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
the gas tank right here you can see

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.930 
the gas tank right here you can see
actually<00:06:55.599> the<00:06:55.840> pipe<00:06:56.050> splits<00:06:56.530> into<00:06:56.710> a<00:06:56.830> Y<00:06:57.130> so

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
actually the pipe splits into a Y so

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.640 
actually the pipe splits into a Y so
that<00:06:58.120> it<00:06:58.270> goes<00:06:58.389> into<00:06:58.569> a<00:06:58.660> Y<00:06:58.870> so<00:06:59.110> it<00:06:59.199> goes<00:06:59.349> to<00:06:59.380> each

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
that it goes into a Y so it goes to each

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.370 
that it goes into a Y so it goes to each
radiator<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:01.180> then<00:07:01.330> it<00:07:01.419> comes<00:07:01.599> back<00:07:01.690> from<00:07:02.199> the

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
radiator and then it comes back from the

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.610 
radiator and then it comes back from the
radiator<00:07:02.940> and<00:07:03.940> into<00:07:04.300> another<00:07:04.479> Y<00:07:04.960> and<00:07:05.500> the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
radiator and into another Y and the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.950 
radiator and into another Y and the
other<00:07:05.740> pipe<00:07:06.039> and<00:07:06.340> then<00:07:06.849> goes<00:07:07.060> back<00:07:07.090> to<00:07:07.389> the<00:07:07.630> the

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
other pipe and then goes back to the the

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.379 
other pipe and then goes back to the the
rear<00:07:08.289> of<00:07:08.319> the<00:07:08.680> car<00:07:08.889> and<00:07:09.250> then<00:07:09.789> the<00:07:09.910> other<00:07:10.090> lines

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
rear of the car and then the other lines

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.420 
rear of the car and then the other lines
that<00:07:10.630> you<00:07:10.750> see<00:07:10.780> here<00:07:11.349> you've<00:07:11.889> got<00:07:12.190> your<00:07:12.220> power

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
that you see here you've got your power

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.879 
that you see here you've got your power
steering<00:07:13.150> lines<00:07:13.180> your<00:07:13.990> air-conditioning

lines your fuel lines and your brake

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.939 
lines your fuel lines and your brake
lines<00:07:18.550> are<00:07:19.150> all<00:07:19.539> going<00:07:20.229> you<00:07:20.560> know<00:07:20.680> from<00:07:20.830> the

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:20.949 
lines are all going you know from the

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.300 
lines are all going you know from the
front<00:07:21.190> to<00:07:21.310> the<00:07:21.340> back<00:07:22.139> so<00:07:23.139> there's<00:07:23.410> the<00:07:23.740> the

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
front to the back so there's the the

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:30.850 
front to the back so there's the the
underside<00:07:24.729> of<00:07:24.759> a<00:07:24.940> 911

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.199 

and<00:07:31.860> here's<00:07:32.069> just<00:07:32.129> a<00:07:32.369> quick<00:07:32.579> look<00:07:32.789> of<00:07:32.969> what<00:07:33.119> it

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:33.209 
and here's just a quick look of what it

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:35.809 
and here's just a quick look of what it
looks<00:07:33.360> like<00:07:33.889> with<00:07:34.889> all<00:07:34.919> of<00:07:35.219> the<00:07:35.339> covers<00:07:35.669> in

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 
looks like with all of the covers in

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:44.809 
looks like with all of the covers in
place<00:07:42.679> you<00:07:43.679> can<00:07:43.829> see<00:07:43.949> they<00:07:44.069> really<00:07:44.099> try<00:07:44.789> to

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819
