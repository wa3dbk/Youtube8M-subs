00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.560 

so<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.010> ion<00:00:14.219> Micro<00:00:14.550> Titanium<00:00:14.730> still<00:00:15.330> weighs

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
so the ion Micro Titanium still weighs

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.700 
so the ion Micro Titanium still weighs
in<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:16.020> 45<00:00:16.950> grams<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.640> 1.5<00:00:18.330> ounces<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.320> very

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

one<00:02:36.700> thing<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.210> this<00:02:38.020> space<00:02:38.260> saver<00:02:38.560> mug

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
one thing that this space saver mug

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.010 
one thing that this space saver mug
doesn't<00:02:39.220> come<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> top<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.240> obviously

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
doesn't come with is a top and obviously

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.660 
doesn't come with is a top and obviously
water<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.410> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.590> boil<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:42.040> whole<00:02:42.490> lot

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
water is going to boil a whole lot

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.180 
water is going to boil a whole lot
faster<00:02:43.180> with<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> top<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:44.800> going<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> boil

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
faster with a top but I'm going to boil

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.190 
faster with a top but I'm going to boil
without<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.880> top<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> see<00:02:46.810> how<00:02:46.930> long<00:02:46.960> it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
without the top just to see how long it

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.780 
without the top just to see how long it
takes<00:02:47.370> turn<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.700> nozzle<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:50.550> very<00:02:51.550> easy

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
takes turn on the nozzle here very easy

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.720 
takes turn on the nozzle here very easy
to<00:02:52.000> light

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.100 

and<00:02:57.030> we'll<00:02:57.209> crank<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.569> all<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> way<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.870> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and we'll crank it all the way up and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:26.680 
and we'll crank it all the way up and
see<00:02:58.260> how<00:02:58.349> long<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.590> takes

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.180 

so<00:03:27.690> we're<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.260> at<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> rolling<00:03:28.890> boil

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
so we're just about at a rolling boil

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.460 
so we're just about at a rolling boil
here<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.000> took<00:03:30.240> about<00:03:30.450> six<00:03:30.930> minutes<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
here and it took about six minutes a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.730 
here and it took about six minutes a
little<00:03:31.800> over<00:03:32.010> six<00:03:32.190> minutes<00:03:33.410> now<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
little over six minutes now I know I

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.430 
little over six minutes now I know I
could<00:03:35.010> cut<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.280> time<00:03:35.520> in<00:03:35.580> half<00:03:36.020> if<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.260> had<00:03:37.410> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
could cut that time in half if it had a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.490 
could cut that time in half if it had a
lid<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.790> still<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.240> bad<00:03:39.480> for<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.020> tiny<00:03:40.290> little

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
lid but still not bad for a tiny little

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.640 
lid but still not bad for a tiny little
stove<00:03:41.630> all<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:42.900> let's<00:03:43.080> do<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.380> again

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
stove all right so let's do this again

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.440 
stove all right so let's do this again
and<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.250> time<00:03:44.310> I'm<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.850> do<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.090> inside

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
and this time I'm going to do it inside

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.630 
and this time I'm going to do it inside
where<00:03:45.690> there's<00:03:45.780> no<00:03:46.080> wind<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:47.400> going<00:03:47.580> to

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
where there's no wind and I'm going to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.280 
where there's no wind and I'm going to
use<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> lid<00:03:48.090> now<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.300> don't<00:03:48.360> recommend<00:03:48.780> anyone

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
use a lid now I don't recommend anyone

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.230 
use a lid now I don't recommend anyone
try<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.530> inside<00:03:50.130> but<00:03:50.760> we're<00:03:50.940> going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> go

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
try this inside but we're going to go

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.870 
try this inside but we're going to go
ahead<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.540> do<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.710> I<00:03:52.740> can<00:03:53.040> see<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
ahead and do so just so I can see the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.420 
ahead and do so just so I can see the
quickest<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.050> could<00:03:55.200> boil<00:03:55.410> two<00:03:56.010> cups<00:03:56.040> of

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
quickest that it could boil two cups of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:48.830 
quickest that it could boil two cups of
water

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.560 

three<00:04:49.320> minute<00:04:49.650> mark<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.190> we're<00:04:51.030> at<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.180> rolling

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
three minute mark and we're at a rolling

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.560 
three minute mark and we're at a rolling
boil

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
boil

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:05.060 
boil
so

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.010 

so<00:05:06.070> three<00:05:06.370> minutes<00:05:06.520> about<00:05:07.120> half<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.570> time<00:05:07.750> and

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
so three minutes about half the time and

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.100 
so three minutes about half the time and
ideal<00:05:08.860> conditions<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.780> hope<00:05:10.900> you<00:05:10.990> guys

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110
