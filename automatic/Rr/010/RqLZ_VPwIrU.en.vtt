then let's have a look at the four that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
then let's have a look at the four that
will<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.950> available<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
will be available the first one the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.160 
will be available the first one the
thrust<00:01:19.080> master<00:01:19.500> T

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
thrust master T

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.149 
thrust master T
this<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.350> doesn't<00:01:22.590> even<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.890> source

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this one doesn't even have source

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
this one doesn't even have source
feedback<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.180> completely<00:01:25.020> ignore<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
feedback so we can completely ignore the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
feedback so we can completely ignore the
fact<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.790> useless<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> no<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.560> will

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
fact that it's useless and no one will

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.310 
fact that it's useless and no one will
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.430> buy<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.850> yes<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> share

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
want to buy it yes it has the share

authentication
now<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.930> contradicts<00:03:54.469> what<00:03:54.590> they<00:03:54.739> initially

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
now that contradicts what they initially

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.470 
now that contradicts what they initially
said<00:03:55.370> when<00:03:55.549> people<00:03:55.819> were<00:03:55.939> testing<00:03:56.359> these

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
said when people were testing these

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.300 
said when people were testing these
logitech<00:03:56.959> wheels<00:03:57.290> with<00:03:57.439> the<00:03:57.469> ps4<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
logitech wheels with the ps4 and the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.209 
logitech wheels with the ps4 and the
reason<00:03:59.239> for<00:03:59.359> this<00:03:59.510> confusion<00:04:00.109> is<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.980> it

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:01.219 
reason for this confusion is that it

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.129 
reason for this confusion is that it
basically<00:04:01.519> works<00:04:02.180> for<00:04:02.389> around<00:04:02.629> about<00:04:02.930> eight

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
basically works for around about eight

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.740 
basically works for around about eight
minutes<00:04:03.469> before<00:04:03.889> it<00:04:04.250> then<00:04:04.519> fires<00:04:05.209> off<00:04:05.449> another

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
minutes before it then fires off another

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.059 
minutes before it then fires off another
sort<00:04:06.109> of<00:04:06.909> authentication<00:04:07.909> request<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.069> at

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
sort of authentication request and at

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.589 
sort of authentication request and at
which<00:04:10.219> point<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.549> becomes<00:04:10.879> useless<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.510> have

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
which point it becomes useless you have

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.939 
which point it becomes useless you have
to<00:04:11.659> unplug<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.199> and<00:04:12.230> plug<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.560> back<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.859> again

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
to unplug it and plug it back in again

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.409 
to unplug it and plug it back in again
so<00:04:13.250> obviously<00:04:13.609> when<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:13.849> were<00:04:13.939> testing<00:04:14.359> it

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
so obviously when they were testing it

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.970 
so obviously when they were testing it
initially<00:04:14.840> they<00:04:14.989> didn't<00:04:15.260> test<00:04:15.439> it<00:04:15.590> for<00:04:15.769> longer

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
initially they didn't test it for longer

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.699 
initially they didn't test it for longer
than<00:04:16.250> eight<00:04:16.459> minutes<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.199> real<00:04:18.410> issue

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
than eight minutes so the real issue

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.779 
than eight minutes so the real issue
here<00:04:18.889> is<00:04:19.489> one<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.970> licensing<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:22.310> looks<00:04:22.639> to

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
here is one of licensing and it looks to

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.400 
here is one of licensing and it looks to
me<00:04:22.910> as<00:04:22.970> if<00:04:23.060> Sony<00:04:23.389> you've<00:04:23.599> got<00:04:23.810> some<00:04:24.020> deal<00:04:24.229> with

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
me as if Sony you've got some deal with

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.990 
me as if Sony you've got some deal with
with<00:04:24.770> Thrustmaster<00:04:25.099> whatever<00:04:25.729> it<00:04:25.880> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
with Thrustmaster whatever it is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.420 
with Thrustmaster whatever it is
whatever<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.990> situation<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.190> needs

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
whatever the the situation is that needs

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.790 
whatever the the situation is that needs
to<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.729> changed<00:04:29.210> because<00:04:29.389> there<00:04:30.080> are<00:04:30.259> hundreds

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
to be changed because there are hundreds

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.279 
to be changed because there are hundreds
of<00:04:30.889> thousands<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.820> Logitech<00:04:32.419> magnetic<00:04:32.960> wheels

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
of thousands of Logitech magnetic wheels

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.570 
of thousands of Logitech magnetic wheels
out<00:04:33.440> there<00:04:33.680> which<00:04:33.830> are<00:04:33.919> now<00:04:34.039> rendered<00:04:34.400> useless

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
out there which are now rendered useless

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.510 
out there which are now rendered useless
so<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> urge<00:04:35.570> you<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.930> go<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.110> change.org<00:04:36.949> and
