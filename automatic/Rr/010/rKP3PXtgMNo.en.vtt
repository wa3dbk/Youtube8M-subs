00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
because apparently looks like a plane it

tastes like banana thoughts on the roof

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.340 
tastes like banana thoughts on the roof
a<00:01:33.409> method<00:01:33.829> I<00:01:34.100> think<00:01:34.429> it's<00:01:34.729> cool<00:01:34.999> I<00:01:35.210> mean<00:01:35.450> it's

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
a method I think it's cool I mean it's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.749 
a method I think it's cool I mean it's
just<00:01:36.469> another<00:01:36.799> way<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.009> solving<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.490> think<00:01:37.700> you

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
just another way of solving I think you

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.719 
just another way of solving I think you
can<00:01:37.909> just<00:01:38.119> be<00:01:38.450> just<00:01:38.780> as<00:01:38.959> fast<00:01:39.139> as<00:01:39.319> sea<00:01:39.439> fog<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.310> I

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
can just be just as fast as sea fog so I

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.609 
can just be just as fast as sea fog so I
mean<00:01:41.240> there's<00:01:41.450> not<00:01:41.539> as<00:01:41.689> many<00:01:41.899> rear<00:01:42.229> solvers

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
mean there's not as many rear solvers

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.289 
mean there's not as many rear solvers
because<00:01:42.889> it's<00:01:43.039> not<00:01:43.159> as<00:01:43.280> popular<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.880> do

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
because it's not as popular but I do

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.449 
because it's not as popular but I do
think<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.719> could<00:01:44.899> be<00:01:45.020> just<00:01:45.049> as<00:01:45.439> fast<00:01:45.649> how<00:01:46.310> many

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
think it could be just as fast how many

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:56.080 
think it could be just as fast how many
stickers<00:01:46.759> tour<00:01:47.649> on<00:01:48.649> all<00:01:49.069> of<00:01:49.399> your<00:01:49.579> fuse<00:01:54.579> um<00:01:55.579> I

quite<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> lot<00:02:01.549> right<00:02:02.209> didn't<00:02:02.990> count<00:02:03.200> backwards

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
quite a lot right didn't count backwards

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.719 
quite a lot right didn't count backwards
so<00:02:04.310> dg2<00:02:04.909> uses<00:02:05.450> original<00:02:05.869> question<00:02:06.229> from<00:02:06.729> Q&amp;A

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
so dg2 uses original question from Q&amp;A

so dg2 uses original question from Q&amp;A
to<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.840> answered<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.560> Q&amp;A<00:02:09.830> 3<00:02:10.190> was<00:02:10.759> spin

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
to that I answered in Q&amp;A 3 was spin

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.150 
to that I answered in Q&amp;A 3 was spin
around<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.990> your<00:02:12.080> chair<00:02:12.140> walk<00:02:12.590> count

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
around in your chair walk count

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.230 
around in your chair walk count
backwards<00:02:14.170> come<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.890> 13<00:02:16.280> backward<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.120> while

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
backwards come to 13 backward so while

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520 
backwards come to 13 backward so while
spinning<00:02:17.450> around<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.870> your<00:02:17.960> chair

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
spinning around in your chair

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.090 
spinning around in your chair
I<00:02:18.560> asked<00:02:19.190> what<00:02:19.310> intervals<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.060> he<00:02:20.750> says

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
I asked what intervals and he says

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.970 
I asked what intervals and he says
rules<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.490> 0.5<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.390> solve<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.050> 2x2<00:02:23.500> while<00:02:23.740> doing

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
rules of 0.5 and solve a 2x2 while doing

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.970 
rules of 0.5 and solve a 2x2 while doing
that<00:02:24.010> okay<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.540> I'm<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.990> got<00:02:26.200> my<00:02:26.380> office<00:02:26.710> chair

I'm alive okay let's put the office
chair<00:03:30.550> back<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.210> minutes<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.960> know<00:03:32.080> forget<00:03:32.590> it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
chair back in minutes you know forget it

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.080 
chair back in minutes you know forget it
let's<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.040> answer<00:03:33.430> questions<00:03:33.460> in<00:03:34.000> this

let's just answer questions in this

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.690 
let's just answer questions in this
chair<00:03:34.360> now<00:03:35.040> programming<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.160> our<00:03:36.400> then<00:03:36.580> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
chair now programming it's our then I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.970 
chair now programming it's our then I
guess<00:03:36.880> you're<00:03:37.180> taking<00:03:37.870> algebra<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.740> is<00:03:38.860> why

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
guess you're taking algebra that is why

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.190 
guess you're taking algebra that is why
it's<00:03:39.130> hard<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.430> program<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.960> to<00:03:41.050> program

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it's hard to program for you to program

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400 
it's hard to program for you to program
by<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.040> way<00:03:42.160> are<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.610> Asian<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.020> are<00:03:44.170> what

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
and I may or may not be taking algebra I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.310 
and I may or may not be taking algebra I
can<00:03:48.910> disclose<00:03:49.210> that<00:03:49.450> information<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.440> um<00:03:51.280> I

would<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> want<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.740> remove<00:04:09.100> clock<00:04:09.430> when

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
would you want to remove clock when

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.200 
would you want to remove clock when
there's<00:04:09.820> FM<00:04:10.180> C<00:04:10.390> because<00:04:10.810> FM<00:04:11.290> c<00:04:11.620> tip<00:04:12.460> the<00:04:13.000> thing

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
there's FM C because FM c tip the thing

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.360 
there's FM C because FM c tip the thing
about<00:04:13.390> FM<00:04:13.780> C<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.500> don't<00:04:14.650> think<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:15.040> should<00:04:15.220> be

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
about FM C is I don't think it should be

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.160 
about FM C is I don't think it should be
removed<00:04:16.030> because<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:16.900> shows<00:04:17.080> a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
removed because it really shows a

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.690 
removed because it really shows a
different<00:04:17.410> side<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.950> giving<00:04:18.100> because

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
different side of giving because

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.460 
different side of giving because
speaking<00:04:18.970> at<00:04:19.330> all<00:04:19.420> it's<00:04:19.960> cool<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.320> it's

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
speaking at all it's cool and it's

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.170 
speaking at all it's cool and it's
really<00:04:20.620> fun<00:04:20.799> fact<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.430> does<00:04:21.549> involve<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:21.880> lot<00:04:22.030> of

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
really fun fact it does involve a lot of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.270 
really fun fact it does involve a lot of
snow<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:23.440> can't<00:04:23.620> get<00:04:23.740> rid<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:24.100> lot<00:04:24.250> of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
snow but you can't get rid of a lot of

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
snow but you can't get rid of a lot of
the<00:04:24.400> thinking<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:24.820> don't<00:04:24.970> really<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.210> to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the thinking you don't really have to

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.610 
the thinking you don't really have to
think<00:04:25.450> all<00:04:25.660> too<00:04:25.780> much<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:26.200> do<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.350> little<00:04:26.470> bit

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
think all too much you do a little bit

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.780 
think all too much you do a little bit
for<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.070> Crossan<00:04:27.340> f12

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
for you know Crossan f12

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.830 
for you know Crossan f12
but<00:04:28.000> mostly<00:04:28.480> it's<00:04:28.900> very<00:04:29.560> just<00:04:30.370> speed<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.450> you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
but mostly it's very just speed so you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.719 
but mostly it's very just speed so you
don't<00:04:32.110> have<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.320> think<00:04:32.530> too<00:04:32.800> much<00:04:33.010> but<00:04:33.220> for<00:04:33.340> FFC

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
don't have to think too much but for FFC

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.110 
don't have to think too much but for FFC
you<00:04:33.790> really

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
you really

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.640 
you really
you<00:04:34.240> have<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.510> think<00:04:34.780> because<00:04:35.169> now<00:04:35.440> you're

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you have to think because now you're

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.170 
you have to think because now you're
figuring<00:04:36.010> out<00:04:36.040> what<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.280> optimal<00:04:36.790> solution

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
figuring out what the optimal solution

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.280 
figuring out what the optimal solution
for<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.600> so<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.960> really<00:04:37.990> shows<00:04:38.229> a

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
for this is so it really shows a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.620 
for this is so it really shows a
different<00:04:38.620> side<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:39.100> people<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.090> think<00:04:40.419> kind

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
different side of people so I think kind

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.150 
different side of people so I think kind
of<00:04:40.780> thing<00:04:40.870> after<00:04:40.960> city<00:04:41.229> should<00:04:41.380> be<00:04:41.410> removed<00:04:41.740> do

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
of thing after city should be removed do

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.990 
of thing after city should be removed do
you<00:04:42.250> think<00:04:42.460> mone<00:04:42.669> will<00:04:42.880> make<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.060> square<00:04:43.510> wannna

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
you think mone will make a square wannna

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.550 
you think mone will make a square wannna
probably<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.210> mean<00:04:46.810> Modi<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.229> gonna<00:04:47.440> make

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
probably I mean Modi is gonna make

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.490 
probably I mean Modi is gonna make
everything<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:48.570> there<00:04:49.570> really<00:04:50.020> caught<00:04:50.229> up<00:04:50.260> with

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
everything I there really caught up with

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.870 
everything I there really caught up with
three<00:04:50.680> by<00:04:50.800> threes<00:04:51.070> right<00:04:51.220> now<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.699> I<00:04:51.729> think

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
three by threes right now but I think

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.050 
three by threes right now but I think
they<00:04:52.330> will<00:04:52.660> end<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.440> sometime<00:04:54.430> making<00:04:54.940> this

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
they will end up sometime making this

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.150 
they will end up sometime making this
for<00:04:55.300> one<00:04:55.479> they<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.169> square<00:04:56.440> one<00:04:56.620> logo<00:04:56.979> it's

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
for one they have a square one logo it's

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.640 
for one they have a square one logo it's
only<00:04:57.310> cubical<00:04:57.820> what's<00:04:58.540> your<00:04:58.750> real<00:04:59.139> name

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
only cubical what's your real name

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.360 
only cubical what's your real name
um<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:00.610> don't<00:05:01.449> fish<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.380> don't<00:05:02.680> have<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.919> real

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
um I don't fish so I don't have a real
