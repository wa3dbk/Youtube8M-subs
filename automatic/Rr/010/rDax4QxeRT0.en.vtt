00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 alright so today I'm going to you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.870
 show how I make my gel for them 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 hair 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 I was using before the freeze echoes styler I 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.189
 found that he gave good results 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.170
 especially at the definition level but 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.769
 at the level of hydration was not 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 yet it therefore since I went 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 in Martinique on vacation and I had 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
 used aloe vera gel I found 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 he had done a good job on 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 hair but I'm going was sweet and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.579
 hydrated but at the definition level 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.410
 was not that yet so what I 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.710
 I'll do to make up for that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.610
 I'm going to use flax seeds that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.530
 will give me a good gel that will define 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.539
 my curls and I'm still 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.320
 used aloe gel to be able to well 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.460
 hydrated my hair i 'm also going 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 add one two two three assets for good 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.100
 what will help me trap in fact 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 hydration in my hair and then 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 a disables too is a protector of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.450
 heat because as you know 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.210
 I like to give a little more 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.460
 volume and long hours using 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.950
 in his hair 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.619
 so here's how 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.420
 tell me what you think and then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700
 and then again thanks we can look 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.189
 my videos 1 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.049
 ok so let's start by making the gel 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.530
 and for that I will use 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.030
 flaxseeds and I'm going m in quarter of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.000
 cup of flax seeds in a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.000
 saucepan or two cups of water 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.950
 before I put the water to boil I will 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.330
 make sure that the seeds of the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.820
 do not cling to the bottom of the pan 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:08.170
 we can have the gel form on the surface 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.610
 2 go so you do leave open 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.070
 manages that you will harvested will be effect 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.980
 and so after four minutes I check 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.060
 the consistency of this gel and I think that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.490
 it's a bit too liquid 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.000
 so I'll put it back to boil again 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.840
 for a minute and after five minutes 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.390
 boiling 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 I think the consistency she is 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.350
 as I wish I do not know too much 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.870
 the team but at the same time it's not 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.870
 too elvis that neither 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.660
 we will now filter the gel from 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.190
 flaxseeds and for that I just 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.080
 put a tights on top of a container 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.400
 and so I'm going to use tongs for 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 to be able to recover my embarrassment 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.040
 do not use your hands because law 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.040
 just been told so it's very hot 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.930
 after about half an hour 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.900
 ambient temperature 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.080
 he will be able to add our assets and we 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.850
 will start with aloe vera 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.490
 aloe vera is rich in sugars and 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.830
 nutrients what will attract 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.730
 water in the skin and in the hair 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.030
 so it's an excellent moisturizer I 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.800
 am going to add a tablespoon 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.710
 aloe vera more you will add 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.190
 davet will see the more you dilute your 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.860
 freeze and the less he will be strong I'll 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.440
 now add honey honey is 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.480
 rich in sugars and nutrients 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.650
 it will make my hair soft and fine 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.690
 to trap the hydration in the hair I 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.840
 will add a tablespoon of 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.840
 honey 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.930
 I will then add some 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.300
 provitamin b5 so this vitamin at a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.360
 fortifying action and embellishes feel 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.510
 and game the hair makes it stronger and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.760
 brighter with the help of my pipe is 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:19.299
 I will put 5 milliliters of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.950
 provitamin b5 in my preparation for 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.860
 to be able to keep my young longer 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.440
 and to prevent it from turning I'm going 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.710
 use a natural preservative so the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.280
 cidal and I'm going to add a thirty 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 drops 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.960
 I will then add ceramics 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.300
 I really like ceramics 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.400
 plant because they bet protect and 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.020
 strengthen the hair fiber but 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.840
 it is also an excellent protector 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.810
 thermal me using time in 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.490
 time his hair to add volume 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.510
 and the length so it's perfect 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.140
 to protect my hair and I'm going 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.880
 add about 2 mm 200 kg talent for 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.780
 finish with the assets i'm going to use 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.380
 lime and lime goes 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.860
 reduce the phd my solution so that's fine 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.330
 make mongel acid and like hair 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.430
 is itself acidic 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.289
 it 's not going to attack fly so I want 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.680
 am just going to add the juice of a slice 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.680
 of lemon 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.600
 now that we have added that our assets 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.789
 I'm going to stir up mongel and color 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.860
 brunette that you can see is brought 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:42.919
 by the honey and I will pour the gel 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.729
 in your containers this a preparation 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.419
 of about three hbo or 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:54.590
 starz and I will keep this gel at 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.569
 fridge I really like this gene because 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.030
 not only and defines well the 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.180
 curls but it does not make my hair 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.419
 super dry and there is no effect 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.300
 cardboard either and it will help well 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.539
 also the hair on the long run 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.160
 consistency it is because that 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.870
 it is not too liquid so I 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.580
 not lose tons but at the same time 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.220
 it's not too much seen what so it's not 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.900
 too hard to apply and then 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.900
 the smell is nice too 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.080

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.740
