00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.510 
doubt about what they were going to find
out<00:04:59.900> there<00:05:00.110> if<00:05:00.290> they<00:05:00.470> will<00:05:00.800> not<00:05:01.010> find<00:05:01.280> anything

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
out there if they will not find anything

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.560 
out there if they will not find anything
they<00:05:02.450> will<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.810> as<00:05:03.050> well<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:04.280> then<00:05:05.060> the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
they will go as well but then the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.930

thursday<00:05:08.330> i<00:05:08.630> am<00:05:09.290> now<00:05:09.530> paying<00:05:09.860> these

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
thursday i am now paying these

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.150 
thursday i am now paying these
scientists<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.900> make<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> whole<00:05:12.560> investigation

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
scientists to make a whole investigation

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.150 
scientists to make a whole investigation
on<00:05:13.700> these<00:05:13.880> it<00:05:14.750> has<00:05:14.930> taken<00:05:15.140> more<00:05:15.530> than<00:05:15.590> 20

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
on these it has taken more than 20

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.240 
on these it has taken more than 20
readings<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:16.850> far<00:05:17.350> we're<00:05:18.350> going<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.650> publish<00:05:19.040> a

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
readings so far we're going to publish a

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.670 
readings so far we're going to publish a
book<00:05:19.490> we're<00:05:20.330> going<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.570> press<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> present<00:05:21.560> a

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
book we're going to press a present a

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.750 
book we're going to press a present a
full<00:05:21.920> investigation<00:05:22.690> because<00:05:23.690> now<00:05:23.900> we<00:05:24.380> think

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
full investigation because now we think

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.510 
full investigation because now we think
not<00:05:25.760> anytime<00:05:26.480> that<00:05:26.870> there<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.590> report<00:05:28.130> or<00:05:28.340> an

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
not anytime that there is a report or an

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.380 
not anytime that there is a report or an
abduction<00:05:28.970> or<00:05:29.390> presence<00:05:30.380> of<00:05:30.560> these<00:05:30.770> creatures

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
abduction or presence of these creatures

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.380 
abduction or presence of these creatures
we<00:05:32.390> should<00:05:32.630> take<00:05:32.840> these<00:05:33.400> counters<00:05:34.400> this

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
we should take these counters this

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.350 
we should take these counters this
machine's<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:37.040> measure<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.610> energy<00:05:37.790> there

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
machine's to to measure the energy there

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.650 
machine's to to measure the energy there
because<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.470> think<00:05:39.830> we<00:05:39.980> found<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.400> way<00:05:40.660> many

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
because I think we found the way many

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.560 
because I think we found the way many
times<00:05:41.780> these<00:05:42.320> creatures<00:05:42.800> can<00:05:43.250> be<00:05:43.580> transport

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
times these creatures can be transport

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.850 
times these creatures can be transport
into<00:05:45.380> Earth<00:05:45.590> I<00:05:45.980> believe<00:05:46.790> there<00:05:47.030> is<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.240> relation

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
into Earth I believe there is a relation

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.940 
into Earth I believe there is a relation
between<00:05:48.860> these<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.430> what<00:05:50.210> we<00:05:50.419> got<00:05:50.600> in<00:05:51.560> drama

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
between these and what we got in drama

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.030 
between these and what we got in drama
series<00:05:52.160> play<00:05:52.580> this<00:05:53.240> hole<00:05:53.540> in<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.840> sky<00:05:54.110> I<00:05:54.440> think

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
series play this hole in the sky I think

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.580 
series play this hole in the sky I think
we<00:05:55.190> are<00:05:55.250> now<00:05:55.430> understanding<00:05:56.330> how<00:05:56.900> all<00:05:57.260> this<00:05:57.530> is

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
we are now understanding how all this is

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.570 
we are now understanding how all this is
happening<00:05:58.840> now<00:05:59.840> at<00:06:00.230> the<00:06:00.440> end<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.770> this<00:06:00.950> stay

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
happening now at the end of this stay

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.630 
happening now at the end of this stay
this<00:06:02.450> stage<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.080> investigation<00:06:03.640> the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
this stage of the investigation the

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.060
