00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.519
 very good two kids here again and 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.309
 good as you see in the title of the video 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.560
 Today I have to show you how to download and 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.590

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.050
 good is a game that has come out 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.050
 on August 31 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.080
 but hey it came out much earlier but what 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 have done now is to take out a version 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.600
 new that is the same as the previous one but 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.240
 that is optimized to do better and those 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.610
 things are worth 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.830
 and it 's very easy to have bars with having to 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.750
 download the torrent of the game you have 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.440
 that download a first author leave 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.180
 the link to download the description 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.410
 here download a torrent and joseba 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.110
 download this file 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.110
 Once downloaded, click 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.990
 good to me the download has gone super 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.000
 Slow good as she will 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.370
 to download 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.990
 it's worth once you download 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.360
 I will not explain how to download 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.960
 products I guess we downloaded from a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 time 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.969
 [Music] 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.950
 so download what downloaded a country 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.400
 where the thing stored in the directory 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.940
 of the game I have it here 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.230
 metro 2033 multi 6 park and you will stay 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.280
 a piece of 800 is worth everything but 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.730
 honestly, it's not going to stay that way 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.620
 exactly so then what I had 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.330
 what to do is go to the first ring 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.490
 that you see the first and gladys click 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 right and extract here is not transition 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.700
 I'm not going to give to cancel because I already 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.310
 has extracted that is going to be this folder 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.360
 and I've done the advice by deleting 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.600
 [Music] 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:07.619
 dvd 2 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:11.340
 Well, here you are going to stay and you give 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.830
 this is going to leave you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 to dvd one and do the same as 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.989
 students but extracting only this one 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.480
 only this east winrar 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.100
 this file of yours and a region that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990
 I have not extracted it, so you will be left 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.260

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.500
 [Music] 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.120

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.090
 and good one has been distracted 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.519
 right click and extract here and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.010
 same I'm going to cancel it because I already 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.240

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.089
 [Music] 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.929
 [Music] 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.850
 worth kids while you were 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.040
 installing is going to leave is 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.270
 with this geisha notification that the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.220
 installation program is digital 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.470
 second disc the second the next 5 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.940
 for what you have to do is you go 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.940
 you are going to examine and now you give 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.280
 level 2 for the doubles do not click big 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.930
 inagua and enter into anything as you know 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.180
 just high but where I had 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.490
 installed the subway the first time 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.250
 the sad and god are 22 points left 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.930
 to accept 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.580
 and follow the installation it will now 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.580
 to cancel is worth it because I already have it 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.900
 and good once you have 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.949
 installed good you have to follow the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.039
 steps that give the following in 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:49.060
 growth in all that once you 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:53.220
 have installed we will be good goes 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.220
 to be a country to team 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.490
 local disk equipment 286 test file 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.850
 of windows 24 bits in that sense 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.590
 32 but fails dry program files 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.360
 Now I'm going to program file 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.879
 for 86 and I look for the subway folder 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.349
 which is here you can give date of 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:20.639
 modification to get you out of more 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:25.469
 old to newest here two thousand 22 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.000
 thousand 33 days and this thing is going to be 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.500
 I would try to run the game 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.969
 to leave some rivals because it is something that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.180
 has to do is go again to 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.490
 where would you have the meter downloaded? 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.889
 installed downloaded voucher that is the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.030
 first time you have the meter that 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.610
 you have all these files 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.639
 and the paisas dvd 2 and crack 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.780
 and good and you keep this 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.980
 this what you have to do is copy 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.430
 copy these these five files do not 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.240
 do you copy 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.440
 and you pay it in the subway folder 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.440
 where I had it installed 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.520
 [Music] 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.210
 to arrive 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.449
 and replace all the files this 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.449
 I will not do it because you can see it 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.370
 here here and here here here and here 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.380
 studying taking for ass or taking guys 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.900
 and 18 seas because that's all I hope that 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.270
 They liked to leave it and subscribe 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.010

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.480
 heap 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.480
 you liked it and until next time 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.780
