00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.720
 I am jpr 80 18 and I bring you a new 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 tutorial to learn how to make a tree 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.720
 of files that would be approximately 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.720
 something like that in which 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.460
 inside a folder tells us the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.410
 folders there 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.279
 and the files that contain those 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 folders and so on making a 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.530
 loop 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.530
 well let's start 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.380
 as you can see 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.220
 here I created a folder 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 with three different folders and each one 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.890
 of those folders 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.650
 contains 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.110
 files or other recipes 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.510
 the text file contains nothing 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 and this is what we have happened to the pad of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.560
 notes for this is not always 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 the right button new 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.200
 text document 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.200
 OK 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 we would get a text document and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.160
 we would have to add the following 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 I'm a cheese tree 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.500
 1% space 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.500
 bar that space 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.680
 we opened what would be this no I do not have 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.680
 very clear the name 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.470
 and this is where we should indicate the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.620
 address 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.840
 where we want our 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.770
 notebook that in this case is going to be 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.909
 this is the copy 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 I. .. you 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840
 and the pearl bus 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.120
 we have to put bar and here we indicate 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.950
 the name that we are going to give to our 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.330
 text document that in this case 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.740
 I will put arm 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.740
 point of x 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.700
 we should important file save 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.040
 com 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.420
 and we have to save it as a file 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 bat 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.180
 the name we give does not matter 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.840
 example 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.840
 creator 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.330
 point bat this if the patient 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.210
 we should indicate the format that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.340
 would have our file 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.340
 once it is done like this 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.670
 as you can see the ones appeared in the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.069
 desk 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.400
 a new file called creator of 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.980
 tree if technique we do the day happens 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 nothing would happen but if we drag 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.550
 the file that we want to convert into a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.550
 tree looks 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.330
 you as you can see nothing happened 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.650
 but if we go to the address that 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.390
 we had chosen before this I would 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.390
 a text file would appear 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.790
 that part would be a text file that 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.180
 in this case it would be our angle 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.760
 and as you can see indicates 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.329
 the place that is located the folders to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.900
 perfection can be compared by 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.310
 example we direct 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.310
 the folder section 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 if we compare it we would leave I do not know what 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.650
 places 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.450
 what would this folder be? 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.720
 daily 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.160
 we introduce ourselves and we would leave these 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.050
 five folders 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 if the opposite was done with the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.260
 photos, it would be the same 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 the gif would come out 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.810
 and with the text and so on 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.680
 I hope you liked it as you can 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.840
 see these types of videos are not the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.490
 normal that usually come out on youtube are 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.389
 new things 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.510
 I hope 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.880
