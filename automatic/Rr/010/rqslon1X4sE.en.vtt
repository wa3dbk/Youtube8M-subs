00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
as with any headphone review we've got

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650 
as with any headphone review we've got
to<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> sound<00:00:39.030> quality

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
to start out with the sound quality

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.750 
to start out with the sound quality
itself<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> most<00:00:41.190> important<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
itself pretty much the most important in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
itself pretty much the most important in
my<00:00:41.879> opinion<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.570> important<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.230> when

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
my opinion the most important thing when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.750 
my opinion the most important thing when
you're<00:00:43.649> buying<00:00:43.770> headphones<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.399> whether<00:00:44.610> they

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you're buying headphones is whether they

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
you're buying headphones is whether they
sound<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.450> mean<00:00:45.600> why<00:00:45.960> would<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> ever<00:00:46.289> buy

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you take a look at headphones and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
you take a look at headphones and
roughly<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> price<00:01:20.640> range<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.330> do

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
roughly this price range they do do

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
roughly this price range they do do
pretty<00:01:21.780> well<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.920> said<00:01:22.979> they're<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
pretty well so like I said they're a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 
pretty well so like I said they're a
little<00:01:23.549> lacking<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.030> bass<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
little lacking in bass which is kind of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.630 
little lacking in bass which is kind of
a<00:01:25.170> disappointment<00:01:25.710> considering<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.340> most

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
a disappointment considering that most

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
this however they just kind of feel

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.750 
this however they just kind of feel
cheap<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.100> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.340> hard<00:02:36.580> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
cheap so you know it's kind of hard to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.850 
cheap so you know it's kind of hard to
say<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.000> mean<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.570> know<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.990> haven't<00:02:38.500> had<00:02:38.680> any

issues with them they haven't broken or
anything<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:41.290> I've<00:02:41.410> had<00:02:41.620> them<00:02:41.800> for

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
anything like that but I've had them for

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.200 
anything like that but I've had them for
you<00:02:42.130> know<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> couple<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.640> months<00:02:42.790> or<00:02:43.030> anything

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
of any kind of long term so it's kind of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.680 
of any kind of long term so it's kind of
hard<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.550> say<00:02:45.730> how<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.120> will<00:02:46.240> hold<00:02:46.390> up<00:02:46.540> over

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
hard to say how they will hold up over

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.440 
hard to say how they will hold up over
the<00:02:46.870> long<00:02:47.020> run<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:48.430> they<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:49.030> kind<00:02:49.210> of<00:02:49.270> feel

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
the long run they they just kind of feel

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.530 
the long run they they just kind of feel
a<00:02:49.480> little<00:02:49.600> bit<00:02:49.840> cheap<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:52.060> know<00:02:52.150> they're<00:02:52.330> all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540

little bit lacking in that area now my
major<00:05:48.639> problem<00:05:48.879> with<00:05:49.089> these<00:05:49.240> is<00:05:49.539> the<00:05:49.870> build

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
major problem with these is the build

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.249 
major problem with these is the build
quality<00:05:50.409> now<00:05:51.009> I<00:05:51.430> just<00:05:51.639> really<00:05:52.029> just<00:05:52.539> have<00:05:53.229> a

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
quality now I just really just have a

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.740 
quality now I just really just have a
hard<00:05:53.650> time<00:05:54.039> paying<00:05:54.610> $100<00:05:55.240> for<00:05:55.270> headphones

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
hard time paying $100 for headphones

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.809 
hard time paying $100 for headphones
like<00:05:55.930> this<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:56.740> they<00:05:56.889> really<00:05:57.039> feel<00:05:57.370> like<00:05:57.400> much

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
like this and they really feel like much

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.149 
like this and they really feel like much
more<00:05:58.000> like<00:05:58.150> 30<00:05:58.719> maybe<00:05:59.080> $40<00:05:59.589> headphones<00:05:59.949> and

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
more like 30 maybe $40 headphones and

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.369 
more like 30 maybe $40 headphones and
they<00:06:00.219> just<00:06:00.400> feel<00:06:00.610> really<00:06:00.849> pretty<00:06:01.150> cheap<00:06:01.449> now

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
they just feel really pretty cheap now

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.140 
they just feel really pretty cheap now
whether<00:06:02.680> this<00:06:02.889> could<00:06:03.099> actually<00:06:03.219> be<00:06:03.490> an<00:06:03.580> issue

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
whether this could actually be an issue

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.999 
whether this could actually be an issue
later<00:06:04.569> on<00:06:04.690> if<00:06:05.080> they're<00:06:05.319> gonna<00:06:05.560> break<00:06:05.860> or

later on if they're gonna break or

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.050 
later on if they're gonna break or
anything<00:06:06.159> like<00:06:06.339> that<00:06:06.370> it's<00:06:06.669> kind<00:06:06.789> of<00:06:06.819> hard<00:06:07.000> to

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
anything like that it's kind of hard to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.820 
anything like that it's kind of hard to
say<00:06:07.300> they<00:06:08.110> don't<00:06:08.169> feel<00:06:08.289> like<00:06:08.560> they're<00:06:08.710> going

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830

high quality same goes for the cable you
know<00:06:17.259> just<00:06:17.440> it<00:06:17.560> just<00:06:17.589> kind<00:06:17.889> of<00:06:17.949> seems<00:06:18.159> a<00:06:18.310> little

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
know just it just kind of seems a little

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.670 
know just it just kind of seems a little
bit<00:06:18.669> cheap<00:06:19.029> and<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.870> definitely<00:06:20.289> is<00:06:20.379> pretty

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
bit cheap and it definitely is pretty

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.290 
bit cheap and it definitely is pretty
annoying<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:20.979> mean<00:06:21.099> I'm<00:06:21.310> just<00:06:21.370> enduring<00:06:22.210> this

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
annoying I mean I'm just enduring this

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.490 
annoying I mean I'm just enduring this
review<00:06:22.690> I<00:06:22.719> mean<00:06:22.870> I'm<00:06:22.930> just<00:06:22.960> looking<00:06:23.169> down<00:06:23.349> and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
review I mean I'm just looking down and

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.719 
review I mean I'm just looking down and
the<00:06:23.560> cables<00:06:23.889> hurdy<00:06:24.099> getting<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.520> all

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
the cables hurdy getting that all

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.540 
the cables hurdy getting that all
tangled<00:06:25.539> up<00:06:25.690> so<00:06:25.990> overall<00:06:26.710> I<00:06:26.860> think<00:06:27.069> these<00:06:27.370> hip

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
tangled up so overall I think these hip

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.430 
tangled up so overall I think these hip
bones<00:06:27.759> are<00:06:28.060> pretty<00:06:28.300> solid<00:06:28.599> unfortunately<00:06:29.409> I

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
bones are pretty solid unfortunately I

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.480 
bones are pretty solid unfortunately I
think<00:06:29.469> they're<00:06:29.680> just<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:29.919> little<00:06:30.190> bit<00:06:30.310> too

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
think they're just a little bit too

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.119 
think they're just a little bit too
expensive<00:06:30.699> now<00:06:31.539> currently<00:06:32.020> these<00:06:32.169> are<00:06:32.379> $100

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 
expensive now currently these are $100

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.219 
expensive now currently these are $100
pretty<00:06:33.460> much<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.759> MSRP<00:06:34.120> which<00:06:34.479> is<00:06:34.629> $100

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
pretty much the MSRP which is $100

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.600 
pretty much the MSRP which is $100
that's<00:06:35.709> pretty<00:06:35.949> much<00:06:36.039> everywhere<00:06:36.430> you<00:06:36.580> find

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
that's pretty much everywhere you find

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.600 
that's pretty much everywhere you find
them<00:06:37.029> I<00:06:37.990> think<00:06:38.649> I<00:06:38.979> really<00:06:39.339> can't<00:06:39.520> recommend

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
them I think I really can't recommend

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.380 
them I think I really can't recommend
them<00:06:39.969> at

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
them at

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.120

price<00:06:40.660> now<00:06:40.900> if<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.140> can<00:06:41.290> find<00:06:41.500> them<00:06:41.680> for<00:06:41.890> maybe

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
price now if you can find them for maybe

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.920 
price now if you can find them for maybe
$75<00:06:43.030> then<00:06:43.270> yeah<00:06:43.570> I<00:06:43.600> would<00:06:43.720> definitely

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
recommend these they're pretty solid

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.670 
recommend these they're pretty solid
again<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.750> audio<00:06:47.020> quality<00:06:47.170> which<00:06:47.500> is<00:06:47.530> the

again the audio quality which is the
most<00:06:48.190> important<00:06:48.670> thing<00:06:48.820> is<00:06:49.150> really<00:06:49.900> pretty

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
most important thing is really pretty

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
pretty intact and you're not gonna have

really any issues with that and of

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.710 
really any issues with that and of
course<00:06:54.610> I<00:06:54.760> could<00:06:54.910> definitely<00:06:55.060> live<00:06:55.450> with<00:06:55.630> the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
course I could definitely live with the

course I could definitely live with the
build<00:06:55.900> quality<00:06:56.080> so<00:06:56.560> you<00:06:57.010> can<00:06:57.130> find<00:06:57.310> these<00:06:57.430> for

build quality so you can find these for

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.880 
build quality so you can find these for
maybe<00:06:57.910> $75<00:06:58.780> or<00:06:58.930> perhaps<00:06:59.260> the<00:06:59.470> price<00:06:59.680> goes<00:06:59.860> down

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
maybe $75 or perhaps the price goes down

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.130 
maybe $75 or perhaps the price goes down
when<00:07:00.490> pick<00:07:00.730> these<00:07:00.850> up<00:07:00.910> otherwise<00:07:01.570> you<00:07:01.930> might

when pick these up otherwise you might

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.230 
when pick these up otherwise you might
