pieces<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.230> hair<00:04:08.410> because<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.770> wanted<00:04:09.010> to

would go back to his natural texture so
I<00:04:12.880> straighten<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.510> hair<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.830> then<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340
