00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
on a closure and this is what I have so

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.390 
on a closure and this is what I have so
far<00:00:13.340> this<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.639> four<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.299> four<00:00:15.330> inch<00:00:15.719> closure

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
far this is a four by four inch closure

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
far this is a four by four inch closure
and<00:00:17.900> as<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.300> am<00:00:21.300> giving<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and as you can see I am giving it a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.540 
and as you can see I am giving it a
defined<00:00:22.800> Center<00:00:23.400> part<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.369> looks

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
defined Center part so it kind of looks

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.119 
defined Center part so it kind of looks
like<00:00:27.140> all<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.380> hair<00:00:28.650> oh<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> fun<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.319 

brushed<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.340> hair<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.910> back<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.829> actually

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
brushed the hair going back but actually

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
brushed the hair going back but actually
I'm<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> ventilating<00:00:45.800> at<00:00:46.800> more<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I'm kind of ventilating at more of a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.240 
I'm kind of ventilating at more of a
side<00:00:47.850> angle<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> front

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
side angle so when I get to the front

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
side angle so when I get to the front
this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.430> another<00:00:59.760> good<00:01:00.030> two

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this is I have about another good two

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
this is I have about another good two
inches<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> front

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
inches so when I get to the front

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.939 
inches so when I get to the front
so<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> started<00:01:03.320> ventilating<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.680> tell

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
so I started ventilating you can tell

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.940 
so I started ventilating you can tell
how<00:01:05.189> its<00:01:05.430> flowing<00:01:06.110> going<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.680> I'm

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
how its flowing going back and now I'm

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
how its flowing going back and now I'm
starting<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.030> ventilate<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:14.390> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
starting the kind of ventilate down and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
starting the kind of ventilate down and
this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.049> define<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.979> part<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this is how you define your part you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
this is how you define your part you
don't<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:19.110> back

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
don't really want it all going back

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.690 
don't really want it all going back
because<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.150> actually<00:01:22.140> um<00:01:22.380> wet<00:01:23.310> hair<00:01:24.110> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
because this is actually um wet hair and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.990 
because this is actually um wet hair and
when<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:26.850> cutting<00:01:27.119> hair<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.110> web

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
when you're cutting hair off the web

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.370 
when you're cutting hair off the web
it's<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:31.070> hard<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.579> make<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.380> unite

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's really hard to make it go unite

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's really hard to make it go unite
uni-directional

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
uni-directional

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
uni-directional
it's<00:01:36.090> basically<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.409> one

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it's basically only gonna go in one

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's basically only gonna go in one
direction<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> ventilated

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
direction and that's how you ventilated

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
direction and that's how you ventilated
so<00:01:41.509> I'm<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.759> started<00:01:45.860> straight<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so I'm I started straight back and then

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.580 
so I'm I started straight back and then
I'm<00:01:48.869> starting<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.439> angle<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.409> at

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
I'm starting to angle it and now I'm at

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
I'm starting to angle it and now I'm at
the<00:01:52.740> midpoint<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.149> two<00:01:54.390> more

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the midpoint because I have two more

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.319 
the midpoint because I have two more
inches<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.460> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.240> down

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
inches to go so I'm kind of going down

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.890 
inches to go so I'm kind of going down
so<00:02:00.329> I'll<00:02:01.130> continue<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.729> ventilating<00:02:03.689> motion

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
so I'll continue this ventilating motion

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.820 
so I'll continue this ventilating motion
all<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.200> way<00:02:06.320> up<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:09.530> when<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.710> get

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
all the way up and then when I get

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.090 
all the way up and then when I get
towards<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.520> edge<00:02:10.930> I'll<00:02:11.930> start<00:02:12.350> going

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
towards the edge I'll start going

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.460 
towards the edge I'll start going
towards<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.880> front<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:15.020> diagonal<00:02:15.470> motion

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
towards the front and a diagonal motion

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.180 
towards the front and a diagonal motion
so<00:02:18.470> basically<00:02:19.220> I'm<00:02:19.460> gonna<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:21.190> ventilating

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
so basically I'm gonna be ventilating

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.530 
so basically I'm gonna be ventilating
had<00:02:22.760> an<00:02:22.880> angle<00:02:23.240> at<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> downward<00:02:23.840> angle<00:02:25.540> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
had an angle at a downward angle and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.710 
had an angle at a downward angle and
when<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.750> get<00:02:26.870> least<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.100> one<00:02:28.280> inch<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.600> I'm

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
when I get least to one inch and I'm

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.320 
when I get least to one inch and I'm
just<00:02:29.960> gonna<00:02:30.110> swing<00:02:30.560> my<00:02:30.770> needle<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.120> gonna

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
just gonna swing my needle so it's gonna

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.180 
just gonna swing my needle so it's gonna
be<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> real<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.800> beautiful<00:02:34.790> flow<00:02:36.130> okay<00:02:37.130> so

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
be a real a beautiful flow okay so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.810 
be a real a beautiful flow okay so
that's<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:39.220> give<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.370> idea<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.090> how<00:02:41.900> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
that's just give you idea of how to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
that's just give you idea of how to
define<00:02:43.820> your<00:02:44.150> center<00:02:44.930> part<00:02:45.970> basically<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
define your center part basically you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.600 
define your center part basically you
want<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.140> keep<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:49.190> or<00:02:49.460> two<00:02:49.580> rolls<00:02:51.250> hair<00:02:52.250> free

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
want to keep one or two rolls hair free

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.790 
want to keep one or two rolls hair free
that's<00:02:53.360> how<00:02:53.540> you're<00:02:53.720> gonna<00:02:53.810> do<00:02:54.050> your<00:02:54.230> part<00:02:54.470> you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
that's how you're gonna do your part you

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:07.330 
that's how you're gonna do your part you
gotta<00:02:54.950> not<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.820> not<00:02:56.000> family<00:02:56.240> any<00:02:56.780> hair

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.670 

I'm<00:03:07.879> not<00:03:08.060> gonna<00:03:08.269> be<00:03:08.420> late<00:03:08.750> any<00:03:09.019> hair<00:03:09.470> down

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
I'm not gonna be late any hair down

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960 
I'm not gonna be late any hair down
those<00:03:09.980> middle<00:03:10.370> holes<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:11.720> I'm<00:03:12.110> doing<00:03:12.970> all

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
those middle holes can I'm doing all

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.619 
those middle holes can I'm doing all
single<00:03:14.599> strands<00:03:15.519> from<00:03:16.519> about<00:03:19.450> two<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.599> three

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
single strands from about two to three

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.229 
single strands from about two to three
rows<00:03:21.110> out<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.650> each<00:03:21.890> side<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.879> could<00:03:23.030> just

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
rows out on each side so it could just
