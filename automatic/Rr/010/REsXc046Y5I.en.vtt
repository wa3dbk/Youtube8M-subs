surprise returning character okay so
what<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.129> genomics

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
what I think that is is not genomics

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
what I think that is is not genomics
that<00:01:03.059> won't<00:01:03.329> reveal<00:01:03.629> surprise<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.949> it's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that won't reveal surprise I think it's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.179 
that won't reveal surprise I think it's
gonna<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> Mortal<00:01:07.020> Kombat<00:01:07.380> 4<00:01:07.710> that's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
gonna be a lot of Mortal Kombat 4 that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380 
gonna be a lot of Mortal Kombat 4 that's
his<00:01:08.400> first<00:01:08.670> debut

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
his first debut

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890 
his first debut
I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:11.360> Rico's<00:01:12.360> known<00:01:12.630> for

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I think this because Rico's known for

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
I think this because Rico's known for
being<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.290> general<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> Shao<00:01:14.130> Kahn's<00:01:14.430> army<00:01:14.939> he

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
being a general and Shao Kahn's army he

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
being a general and Shao Kahn's army he

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
general in shinnok's army at one point

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490 
general in shinnok's army at one point
but<00:01:19.759> more<00:01:20.759> Shao<00:01:21.210> Kahn's<00:01:21.509> army<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.320> has

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
but more Shao Kahn's army he even has

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.289 
but more Shao Kahn's army he even has
some<00:01:22.770> moves<00:01:23.040> similar<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> Shao<00:01:23.790> Kahn<00:01:24.060> like

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
some moves similar to Shao Kahn like

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
some moves similar to Shao Kahn like
Shaq<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.780> his<00:01:24.930> shoulder<00:01:25.259> charge<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> Shao

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
Shaq on his shoulder charge and Shao

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.679 
Shaq on his shoulder charge and Shao
Kahn's<00:01:26.430> Tellman<00:01:26.820> appears<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.299> his<00:01:27.420> head

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
Kahn's Tellman appears on his head

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
Kahn's Tellman appears on his head
during<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> move<00:01:28.590> watch<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.460> it'll

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
during that move watch I think it'll

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.420 
during that move watch I think it'll
happen<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> gameplay<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.020> soon<00:01:31.430> right

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
happen in the gameplay here soon right

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.350 
happen in the gameplay here soon right
there<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.520> spoiler

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
there and I think as you know spoiler

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.170 
there and I think as you know spoiler
alert<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.840> Mortal<00:01:37.439> Kombat<00:01:37.740> 9<00:01:37.770> Shao<00:01:38.729> Kahn<00:01:38.970> was

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
alert in Mortal Kombat 9 Shao Kahn was

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.710 
alert in Mortal Kombat 9 Shao Kahn was
killed<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.079> Rico<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.970> return

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
killed so I think Rico is gonna return

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.130 
killed so I think Rico is gonna return
to<00:01:43.470> take<00:01:43.710> Shao<00:01:44.280> Kahn's<00:01:44.610> throne<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.420> Emperor

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to take Shao Kahn's throne as Emperor

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
to take Shao Kahn's throne as Emperor
and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.700> what's<00:01:47.970> gonna<00:01:48.060> happen

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and I think that's what's gonna happen

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
and I think that's what's gonna happen
like<00:01:48.720> shinnok<00:01:49.170> will<00:01:49.380> seem<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> villain

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
like shinnok will seem to be the villain

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
like shinnok will seem to be the villain
at<00:01:50.369> first<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.060> Rico<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.630> pop<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> be

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
at first then Rico will pop out and be

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200 
at first then Rico will pop out and be
the<00:01:52.350> true<00:01:53.750> big<00:01:54.750> baddie<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> speak<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the true big baddie so to speak and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.660 
the true big baddie so to speak and
that's<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.719> gonna<00:01:57.840> happen<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
that's what I think is gonna happen and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.450 
that's what I think is gonna happen and
