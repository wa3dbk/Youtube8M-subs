candle<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.010> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.360> try<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
candle there you know and then try to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.300 
candle there you know and then try to
envision<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.620> I'm<00:02:07.740> doing<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.099> for

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
envision like if I'm doing this for

Instagram<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.720> try<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> frame<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.130> my

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
Instagram then I try to frame it in my

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.860 
Instagram then I try to frame it in my
mind<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.819> how<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.420> look<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.780> maybe

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
mind like how it would look or maybe

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.900 
mind like how it would look or maybe
I'll<00:02:13.080> take<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.410> couple<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.040> pictures<00:02:14.310> square

you know should I add you know maybe
some<00:02:28.260> candles<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.519> or<00:02:30.360> maybe<00:02:30.510> I'll<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
some candles in there or maybe I'll I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.180 
some candles in there or maybe I'll I
might<00:02:32.040> decide<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.640> okay<00:02:33.030> well<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.409> candles

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
might decide like okay well the candles

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.780 
might decide like okay well the candles
don't<00:02:35.579> quite<00:02:35.970> work<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:39.950> maybe<00:02:40.950> I'll<00:02:41.129> just<00:02:41.459> go

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
don't quite work so maybe I'll just go

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.380 
don't quite work so maybe I'll just go
with<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:43.409> flower<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.700> huge<00:02:45.090> flower

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
with the flower this is a huge flower

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.229 
with the flower this is a huge flower
fake<00:02:45.780> flower<00:02:46.049> right<00:02:46.379> but<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.459> framing<00:02:47.910> this

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
fake flower right but I'm framing this

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.900 
fake flower right but I'm framing this
so<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.599> don't<00:02:48.930> care<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> stem<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.519> going

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so I don't care that the stem is going

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.420 
so I don't care that the stem is going
to<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.359> outside<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> picture<00:02:52.440> because

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
to be outside of the picture because

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.210 
to be outside of the picture because
when<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> frame<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.560> know<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.890> gonna<00:02:56.010> be

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
when I frame it you know it's gonna be

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.559 
when I frame it you know it's gonna be
something<00:02:56.670> like<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:58.170> right<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:02.359> think<00:03:03.359> I

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
something like this right so I think I

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.390 
something like this right so I think I
like<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> flower<00:03:04.140> better<00:03:04.500> than<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.890> can

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
like the flower better than the can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.250 
like the flower better than the can
though<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.739> may<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.109> have

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
though and I may go see if I have

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110 
though and I may go see if I have
another<00:03:10.500> flower<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.220> add<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:11.879> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
another flower to add to this but I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.140 
another flower to add to this but I
think<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.409> work<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> am<00:03:14.549> losing<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
think this will work now I am losing the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.990 
think this will work now I am losing the
light<00:03:15.329> here<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.170> suggest<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.069> using<00:03:17.670> as

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
light here like I suggest to using as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.650 
light here like I suggest to using as
much<00:03:18.420> natural<00:03:18.810> light<00:03:19.349> as<00:03:19.560> possible<00:03:20.389> I'm<00:03:21.389> just

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
much natural light as possible I'm just

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.550 
much natural light as possible I'm just
doing<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.019> later<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> day<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:25.260> light

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
doing this later in the day so the light

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.530 
doing this later in the day so the light
if<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.069> it's<00:03:26.250> about<00:03:27.260> 5:30<00:03:28.370> p.m.<00:03:29.540> Eastern

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
if you know it's about 5:30 p.m. Eastern

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.460 
if you know it's about 5:30 p.m. Eastern
Standard<00:03:30.569> Time

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
Standard Time

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.199 
Standard Time
so<00:03:31.859> we're<00:03:32.340> starting<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.669> lose<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.000> light<00:03:33.180> a

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
so we're starting to lose the light a

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.960 
so we're starting to lose the light a
bit<00:03:33.329> but<00:03:34.169> if<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.889> was<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.340> early<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.849> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
bit but if this was like early in the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.710 
bit but if this was like early in the
morning<00:03:36.269> like<00:03:36.480> 9<00:03:37.440> 10<00:03:37.919> o'clock<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:39.030> Sun<00:03:39.389> would

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
morning like 9 10 o'clock the Sun would

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.530 
morning like 9 10 o'clock the Sun would
be<00:03:39.750> beaming<00:03:40.379> in<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.069> would<00:03:41.250> really

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
be beaming in here and I would really

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.199 
be beaming in here and I would really
get<00:03:42.540> like<00:03:42.959> good<00:03:43.500> tones<00:03:43.919> on<00:03:44.340> my<00:03:44.459> products<00:03:45.030> on

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
get like good tones on my products on

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.059 
get like good tones on my products on
the<00:03:45.359> table<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.440> definitely<00:03:46.709> recommend

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
you'll see basically it normally equals

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:47.660 
you'll see basically it normally equals
up<00:06:29.139> to<00:06:29.469> a<00:06:29.500> square

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670
