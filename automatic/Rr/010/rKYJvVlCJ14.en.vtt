00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.050 

let's<00:00:01.530> talk<00:00:01.740> about<00:00:01.860> glutathione<00:00:02.370> in<00:00:02.820> this

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
let's talk about glutathione in this

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.200 
let's talk about glutathione in this
video<00:00:03.620> now<00:00:04.620> glutathione<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.520> an<00:00:05.730> antioxidant

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
video now glutathione is an antioxidant

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.660 
video now glutathione is an antioxidant
and<00:00:07.250> glutathione<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.670> found<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.960> body

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
and glutathione is found in the body

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.580 
and glutathione is found in the body
under<00:00:11.670> certain<00:00:11.960> circumstances<00:00:12.960> such<00:00:13.230> as

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
under certain circumstances such as

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
under certain circumstances such as
physical<00:00:14.370> illness<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.089> even<00:00:15.299> mental<00:00:15.690> illness

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
physical illness and even mental illness

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.290 
physical illness and even mental illness
glutathione<00:00:17.300> amounts<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> body<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.590> drop

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
glutathione amounts in the body can drop

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
glutathione amounts in the body can drop
now<00:00:21.359> luta<00:00:22.020> kion<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:23.570> administered<00:00:25.609> from

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
now luta kion can be administered from

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.990 
now luta kion can be administered from
outside<00:00:27.390> as<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:28.050> addiction<00:00:28.550> as<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:29.820> as

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
outside as an addiction as well as

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.950 
outside as an addiction as well as
sometimes<00:00:30.390> over<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.050> too<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.329> give

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
sometimes over it too now when you give

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
sometimes over it too now when you give
an<00:00:34.050> injection<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.710> glutathione<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:36.149> levels

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
an injection of glutathione the levels

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.709 
an injection of glutathione the levels
of<00:00:36.750> glutathione<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.100> body<00:00:38.480> increases<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
of glutathione in the body increases and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.850 
of glutathione in the body increases and
what<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> effects<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.629> glutathione<00:00:42.860> now

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
what are the effects of glutathione now

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
what are the effects of glutathione now
because<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:46.520> because<00:00:47.520> glutathione<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.239> an

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because we because glutathione is an

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.840 
because we because glutathione is an
antioxidant<00:00:49.910> all<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.629> good<00:00:51.809> effects<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
antioxidant all the good effects of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
antioxidant all the good effects of
antioxidants<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.510> obtained<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.620> using

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
antioxidants can be obtained by using

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.660 
antioxidants can be obtained by using
glutathione<00:00:56.370> namely<00:00:57.149> prevention<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> cancer

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
glutathione namely prevention of cancer

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.020 
glutathione namely prevention of cancer
delaying<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> aging<00:01:01.280> removal<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> toxins

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
delaying of aging removal of the toxins

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
delaying of aging removal of the toxins
in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> body<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.960> liver<00:01:05.090> increased

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in the body and the liver increased

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.010 
in the body and the liver increased
immunity<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.520> prevention<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> cancer<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
immunity and prevention of cancer and so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.170 
immunity and prevention of cancer and so
on<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.750> chronic<00:01:13.140> illness<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
on now when you have chronic illness and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
on now when you have chronic illness and
when<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.540> glutathione<00:01:16.009> this<00:01:17.009> illness

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
when you take glutathione this illness

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.530 
when you take glutathione this illness
also<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.560> tend<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> improve<00:01:20.270> now<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
also can tend to improve now as a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.320 
also can tend to improve now as a
scientific<00:01:22.020> glutathione<00:01:22.470> causes<00:01:23.330> skin

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
scientific glutathione causes skin

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.219 
scientific glutathione causes skin
whitening<00:01:24.540> due<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.640> reduction<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.229> amount

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
whitening due to reduction in the amount

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
whitening due to reduction in the amount
of<00:01:28.590> melanin<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.520> skin<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of melanin in the skin now this is a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
of melanin in the skin now this is a
beneficial<00:01:31.170> effect<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.710> there's<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> huge

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
beneficial effect and there's a huge

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.810 
beneficial effect and there's a huge
demand<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.060> glutathione<00:01:34.520> because<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
demand for glutathione because of this

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.200 
demand for glutathione because of this
effect<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.520> very<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.159> safe

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
glutathione injections we administer we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.230 
glutathione injections we administer we
also<00:01:52.619> sometimes<00:01:53.930> administer<00:01:54.930> other

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
also sometimes administer other

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
also sometimes administer other
ingredients<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.360> well<00:01:57.659> namely<00:01:58.170> collagen

the use of these injections we can get

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
the use of these injections we can get
very<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.819> results<00:02:09.679> when<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.450> hope<00:02:12.450> will

very good results when we are hope will

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.770 
very good results when we are hope will
