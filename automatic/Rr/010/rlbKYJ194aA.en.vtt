00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.370
 let's go to the story about ski boots 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.410
 what kind of firm do they come about 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 better what to look for and stuff 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 start from the beginning how to understand 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.760
 foot size there width pads length 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 ski boots size pads 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 most often written in a very convenient 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.399
 system 12 centimeters just for washing 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.860
 centimeters in a crowd 27 526 and so on 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.469
 you can measure your leg with a ruler and so 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 pick up a shoe but the price is a little bit 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 different manufacturers 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.920
 different sizes and all the shoes sit by 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 differently that is, you can also 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 build on your feelings like he 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.760
 due to the fact that the shoe is tight 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.149
 he sits unexpectedly tuba on his leg and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.879
 what's normal what's normal in length 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.129
 not so much when you are standing 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 keep your fingers exactly straight 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.329
 abut weak and barely touches 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.299
 new boot sock sensation when 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.700
 push his leg pushing away push 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.400
 and squat we press on this point of the boot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 heel slides back in front 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.979
 fingers appear but about the floor 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.080
 a centimeter half a centimeter and no more 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 too bad if the foot goes back and forth to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 a little loose should start 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 will freeze the rest is already width 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.939
 pads and that 's the same name from the size 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.740
 but also from the boot model as a rule 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.500
 all major manufacturers now have 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.369
 three pads a very important point is that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.729
 many think 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.899
 oh all phisher or all rossignol narrow 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 delusions this one narrow got caught 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.350
 sports and so there are wide each 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.920
 firms and wide prisoners wide enough 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.759
 significant besides narrow how 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.540
 the rule of expert class shoes they have 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.420
 a little thinner inside niki 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.729
 no boot 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.369
 Difficult to find, let's remove here 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.300
 sports trip old legendary 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.220
 yellow rossignol 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.690
 here it is inside nicks as thick as 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.580
 centimeter and take some comfortable 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.580
 care on comic-con that it is much wider 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.069
 at the same size 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.670
 Latina is much wider wide here 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.690
 in this place 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.090
 status which boat is wide but also myself 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.840
 domestic thicker here he is no longer 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.540
 a centimeter and a half then two places and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.489
 spider thermo molds to him where 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.019
 curl up a little to take the shape of the legs and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.269
 where they give there will go push 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.880
 stop here from the plastic legs 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.799
 the distances are small and he already is 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.769
 There is of course I will not become but all growth 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.630
 pick harder if you need to pick 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.390
 hard sport boot much 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.549
 more will have to measure if unlike 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.920
 from which are comfortable for example 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:09.590
 also use and sit down all about 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.150
 shoe classes and rights their stiffness as 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.840
 time and continue the next video on
