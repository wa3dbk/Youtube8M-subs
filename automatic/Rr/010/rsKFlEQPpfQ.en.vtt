00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
really if you look at that pace in that

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.929 
really if you look at that pace in that
shooting<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.279> might<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.580> pull<00:00:20.789> off

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
shooting you you might get pull off

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
shooting you you might get pull off
you'd<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.330> no<00:00:21.570> III<00:00:22.080> don't<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.590> don't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you'd think no III don't know I don't

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.929 
you'd think no III don't know I don't
want<00:00:22.920> someone<00:00:23.100> that's<00:00:23.220> gonna<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.580> slow

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
want someone that's gonna be really slow

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509 
want someone that's gonna be really slow
and<00:00:24.180> isn't<00:00:24.840> gonna<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.050> able<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> score<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> goal

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and isn't gonna be able to score a goal

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.160 
and isn't gonna be able to score a goal
if<00:00:26.670> he<00:00:26.789> does<00:00:26.970> come<00:00:27.119> from<00:00:27.420> God<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.779> really

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
if he does come from God but really

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
if he does come from God but really
those<00:00:28.710> those<00:00:29.189> stats<00:00:29.490> felt<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.910> lie<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> me

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
those those stats felt like a lie to me

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620 
those those stats felt like a lie to me
although<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> pace<00:00:31.500> wasn't<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.160> much<00:00:32.630> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
although the pace wasn't so much you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
although the pace wasn't so much you
know<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> still<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.680> he<00:00:34.800> seemed<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> bit

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
know I still think he seemed a bit

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
know I still think he seemed a bit
faster<00:00:35.820> than<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.750> again<00:00:37.230> he

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
faster than what it was but again he

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
faster than what it was but again he
he's<00:00:38.100> gonna<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> fend<00:00:38.730> his<00:00:38.820> catch<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
he's gonna have to fend his catch up to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
he's gonna have to fend his catch up to
him<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.570> shooting<00:00:40.050> he<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.160> target

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
him but for shooting he was so on target

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
him but for shooting he was so on target
he<00:00:41.700> could<00:00:41.879> manage<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.360> score<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.040> pretty

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
he could manage to score it in pretty

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
he could manage to score it in pretty
much<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.700> ninety<00:00:45.210> percent<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:45.960> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
much like ninety percent of the time I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
much like ninety percent of the time I
came<00:00:46.170> through<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.770> goal<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.190> long<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.760> he

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
came through it on goal as long as he

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
came through it on goal as long as he
had<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> nice<00:00:48.360> clear<00:00:48.780> view<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> goal<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.559> was

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
had a nice clear view of the goal he was

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310 
had a nice clear view of the goal he was
banging<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.520> me<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> dies<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.840> was

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

expecting<00:00:54.239> much<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> picked<00:00:55.590> him

good<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.420> handling<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> ball<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.320> knew<00:01:31.500> his

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.190 
heading as well it was so good he was so
accurate<00:02:58.610> when<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.060> came<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.360> heading<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.780> like

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
accurate when it came to heading it like

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.050 
accurate when it came to heading it like
a<00:03:00.350> lot<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.620> times<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:00.920> well<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.310> came<00:03:01.640> from<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> bit

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
a lot of times as well I came from a bit

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.370 
a lot of times as well I came from a bit
distance<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.510> box<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.900> he<00:03:03.020> was<00:03:03.170> still

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
distance in the box and he was still

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.290 
distance in the box and he was still
heading<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.740> in<00:03:03.860> for<00:03:04.130> me<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.490> again<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.210> was

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
heading it in for me so again that was

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.660 
heading it in for me so again that was
great<00:03:05.450> however<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.170> say<00:03:06.560> he<00:03:07.100> hasn't<00:03:07.400> got<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.520> lot

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
great however I say he hasn't got a lot

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.980 
great however I say he hasn't got a lot
of<00:03:07.700> strength<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.240> we<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.540> get<00:03:08.690> knocked<00:03:08.900> off

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
of strength so we can get knocked off

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.090 
of strength so we can get knocked off
the<00:03:09.110> ball<00:03:09.290> but<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.620> are<00:03:09.770> good<00:03:09.920> with<00:03:09.950> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
the ball but if you are good with the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.680 
the ball but if you are good with the
dribbling<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.880> commands<00:03:11.210> just<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.540> look<00:03:11.630> at

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
dribbling you commands just to look at

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.570 
dribbling you commands just to look at
yourself<00:03:12.020> out<00:03:12.200> there<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.410> as<00:03:12.560> well<00:03:12.740> pace<00:03:13.400> is

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
yourself out there and as well pace is

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.970 
yourself out there and as well pace is
not<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.210> bad<00:03:14.450> but<00:03:14.720> again<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.650> noticeable

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
not that bad but again it is noticeable

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.650 
not that bad but again it is noticeable
you're<00:03:16.520> going<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.850> them<00:03:17.060> catch<00:03:17.270> up<00:03:17.510> to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
you're going to have them catch up to

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.750 
you're going to have them catch up to
you<00:03:17.750> which<00:03:17.960> can<00:03:18.200> be<00:03:18.350> an<00:03:18.410> issue<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.710> times<00:03:18.950> but

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760
