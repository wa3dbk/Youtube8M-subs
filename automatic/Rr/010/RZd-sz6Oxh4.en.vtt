00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and I have something really interesting

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.560 
and I have something really interesting
for<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.620> will<00:00:11.130> deal<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.910> retain<00:00:12.360> from

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
for you that will deal with retain from

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360 
for you that will deal with retain from
your<00:00:12.750> crucible<00:00:13.080> automatically<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.190> can

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
your crucible automatically so you can

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640 
your crucible automatically so you can
see<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.059> 75<00:00:15.839> ignis<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.470> there

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
see here that I have 75 ignis in there

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
see here that I have 75 ignis in there
and<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.310> being<00:00:17.520> decomposed<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.720> speak<00:00:19.050> so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and it's being decomposed as we speak so

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
and it's being decomposed as we speak so
and<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.430> notice<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.119> second<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
and you notice just a second go this

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.450 
and you notice just a second go this
block<00:00:21.990> move<00:00:22.199> forward<00:00:22.650> obviously<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
block move forward obviously it's a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
block move forward obviously it's a
piston<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:24.000> doing<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> that's<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.470> not

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
piston that's doing it that's not not

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
piston that's doing it that's not not
the<00:00:26.130> interesting<00:00:26.400> part<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.480> interesting

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
she of that little purple wand you see

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.149 
she of that little purple wand you see
there<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.930> rotten<00:01:06.930> flesh<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.920> here

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
there and rotten flesh you can see here

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
there and rotten flesh you can see here
that<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.820> extra<00:01:09.119> ignis<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> that's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that this has an extra ignis and that's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
that this has an extra ignis and that's
how<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> exiting<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.040> because

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
how I got that exiting this is because

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.490 
how I got that exiting this is because
fails<00:01:11.880> recording<00:01:12.510> earlier<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fails recording earlier so I'm just

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
fails recording earlier so I'm just
going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> throw<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> I'm

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to throw this in there and I'm

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.859 
going to throw this in there and I'm
going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> show<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.450> exactly<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> does

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
going to show you exactly what it does

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.289 
going to show you exactly what it does
so<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.909> we<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so there we have that and we have that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
so there we have that and we have that
extra<00:01:21.630> ignis<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.340> I'm<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
extra ignis in there and so I'm going to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.620 
extra ignis in there and so I'm going to
clear<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:23.939> real<00:01:24.150> quick<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
clear that out real quick and you can

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
clear that out real quick and you can
see<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.900> instead<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> having<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.220> big<00:01:26.430> ol

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
see that instead of having that big ol

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
see that instead of having that big ol
flex<00:01:27.000> paint<00:01:27.630> stuff<00:01:27.930> fly<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.979> automatically

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
flex paint stuff fly up it automatically

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
flex paint stuff fly up it automatically
dealt<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> show<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
dealt with it and I'm going to show you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760 
dealt with it and I'm going to show you
how<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.540> simple<00:01:33.810> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
how to do that it's really simple this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
how to do that it's really simple this
is<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.040> required<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.880> something<00:01:36.060> there

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is not required is just something there

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
is not required is just something there
i'm<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> thinking<00:01:37.250> about<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
i'm kind of thinking about doing this in

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.429 
i'm kind of thinking about doing this in
one<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.119> worlds<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
one of my worlds and just kind of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
one of my worlds and just kind of
testing<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.150> stuff<00:01:42.390> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
testing that out but all the stuff you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
testing that out but all the stuff you
need<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> here's<00:01:44.670> your

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
need is right here so you here's your

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
need is right here so you here's your
crucible<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> need

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
crucible and you're going to need

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
crucible and you're going to need
something<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.070> random<00:01:47.520> things<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.149> block

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
something from random things a block

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.139 
something from random things a block
detector<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
detector and that's going to need to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
detector and that's going to need to
face<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.540> tooth<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> need<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
face in tooth here we're going to need a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.090 
face in tooth here we're going to need a
pulse<00:01:53.820> former<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.680> then<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
pulse former and then you're going to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.819 
pulse former and then you're going to
need<00:01:56.219> repeater<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.360> redstone<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
need repeater at some redstone and a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.160 
need repeater at some redstone and a
sticky<00:01:59.280> piston<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.790> there<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
sticky piston right there and so what

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.230 
sticky piston right there and so what
this<00:02:01.290> does<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.799> whenever<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.280> detects<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
this does is whenever this detects a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.850 
this does is whenever this detects a
block<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:05.450> output<00:02:06.450> redstone<00:02:07.439> signal<00:02:07.590> on

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
block it will output redstone signal on

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.609 
block it will output redstone signal on
all<00:02:08.039> its<00:02:08.190> sides<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:10.020> put<00:02:10.349> into

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
all its sides and so this will put into

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740 
all its sides and so this will put into
a<00:02:10.739> pulse<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> wasn't<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> pulse<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.209> this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
a pulse if it wasn't a pulse then this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
a pulse if it wasn't a pulse then this
we'll<00:02:12.960> just<00:02:13.110> stay<00:02:13.320> here<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.220> would

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
we'll just stay here because it would

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
we'll just stay here because it would
continuously<00:02:14.970> detect<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.230> block

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
continuously detect because this block

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.350 
continuously detect because this block
will<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.620> right<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.220> start<00:02:17.940> detecting

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
will be right here and start detecting

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
will be right here and start detecting
this<00:02:18.540> instead<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> taint<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.830> don't<00:02:20.010> want

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
this instead of the taint you don't want

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.710 
this instead of the taint you don't want
that<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.460> wanted<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.000> pulse<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.570> come

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that you wanted to just pulse and come

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.260 
that you wanted to just pulse and come
back<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.520> with<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
back if you just have this one with the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
back if you just have this one with the
taint<00:02:24.510> you're<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:26.220> block

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
taint you're going to have a this block

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.430 
taint you're going to have a this block
right<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:26.870> instead<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> be

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
right here instead it's going to be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350 
right here instead it's going to be
right<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> whole<00:02:29.040> time<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:30.000> that's<00:02:30.240> why

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
right there the whole time so that's why

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
right there the whole time so that's why
we<00:02:30.420> need<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.750> extra<00:02:31.080> circuit<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.709> with

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
we need this extra circuit here with

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.970 
we need this extra circuit here with
this<00:02:32.040> extra<00:02:32.310> tick<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> slow

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
this extra tick and that's going to slow

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.380 
this extra tick and that's going to slow
it<00:02:35.040> down<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.520> little<00:02:35.670> bit<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.300> going

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it down just a little bit but it's going

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.600 
it down just a little bit but it's going
to<00:02:36.450> make<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.050> much<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.290> stable<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.980> so

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
to make it so much more stable and so

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.220 
to make it so much more stable and so
whenever<00:02:39.390> there's<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.600> block<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:39.810> it's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
whenever there's a block there it's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.580 
whenever there's a block there it's
going<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.709> push<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> out<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:42.590> nothing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
going to push it out of the way nothing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.150 
going to push it out of the way nothing
much<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.870> added<00:02:46.160> this

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
much to it really so I just added this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
much to it really so I just added this
little<00:02:47.220> drawbridge<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.870> easily

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
little drawbridge here so you can easily

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.540 
little drawbridge here so you can easily
um<00:02:51.080> take<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.230> any<00:02:52.470> taint<00:02:52.830> or<00:02:52.980> whatever<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.520> a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
um take out any taint or whatever with a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.100 
um take out any taint or whatever with a
flick<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.030> lever<00:02:54.270> instead<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.720> needing<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
flick of the lever instead of needing a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.150 
flick of the lever instead of needing a
wand<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.980> just<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:58.160> find

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
wand on you it's just there and I find

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.830 
wand on you it's just there and I find
that<00:02:59.250> useful<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.910> pretty<00:03:00.120> simple<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> can

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
that useful it's pretty simple you can

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.250 
that useful it's pretty simple you can
kind<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.820> I'm<00:03:02.820> going<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
kind of see what to do and I'm going to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.690 
kind of see what to do and I'm going to
just<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.470> even<00:03:04.709> explain<00:03:05.010> how<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.250> do<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> any

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
just not even explain how to do it any

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.430 
just not even explain how to do it any
more<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.120> because<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.959> pretty

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
more than this because it's pretty

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.290 
more than this because it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:07.739> it's<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.730> simple<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
self-explanatory it's really simple and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.420 
self-explanatory it's really simple and
so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.989> think<00:03:10.500> that's<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.130> thanks<00:03:11.340> for

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
so I think that's it so thanks for

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.830 
so I think that's it so thanks for
watching<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.090> great<00:03:12.209> day<00:03:12.330> hope<00:03:12.630> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
watching and have a great day hope this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.140 
watching and have a great day hope this
helps
