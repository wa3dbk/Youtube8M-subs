00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.820
 Mr. Vien Long Binh - who was dubbed the father of hybrid rice - warned that the food crisis in China could happen at any time, and entailed a social crisis. 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.680
 The government has also repeatedly emphasized food security. This has caused a lot of controversy. 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.640
 Will the food crisis be avoided? Please listen to the analysts. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.940
 Agricultural scientist Vien Long Binh wrote an article entitled "China cannot avoid catastrophe" 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.520
 He listed 12 reasons for food crisis in China at any time. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 Accordingly, food scarcity in China will likely cause serious consequences. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 Reduce the rate of self-production of food and cooking oil; food security is not guaranteed; environmental pollution and many factors affecting food security; 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.100
 seed sources depend on foreign technology; genetically modified food and weak national reserves; 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.860
 Food prices are so low that farmers do not continue farming. 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.120
 The article concluded: "I can imagine the chaos that comes next. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.560
 Cannibalism, homelessness and hunger. All can happen at any time. " 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 Gong Sheng Li, chief researcher of the financial magazine National Reference said: 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.160
 "In recent years, China's food imports have increased sharply while domestic food resources have declined. Vienna Long Binh has not exaggerated." 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.660
 [Victory] "Soybean oil, olive oil, many other vegetable oils in the past few years are very scarce, especially soybean oil. 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.160
 Sources said they produced very little. Sourced soybeans cause scarcity. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.900
 70% of China's cooking oil is now imported. This is extremely serious. " 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.860
 Before 2011, China only allowed very little imports of rice and wheat, most imported corn only. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:53.600
 In 2011, the China State Council Research Center predicted that imported grain would increase from 4.16 million tons in 1997 to 22.24 million tons in 2020. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.120
 But in 2012, food imports amounted to 70 million tons. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.460
 This threatens the rate of self-sufficiency in food, lower than the alarm level set above 95% of demand. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440
 Other countries are concerned that the food situation in China may cause a global crisis. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.380
 According to Brett Rierson, director of the World Food Program in China, 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.420
 Last year China became the world's second-largest importer of rice and barley, ranking 10th in corn imports and among the top 20 most wheat importers. 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.500
 [Chinese economist, Mao Ye] "China needs to import food, because the cost of production in China is very high. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.400
 While in the US and other countries is much cheaper. So China has to import. 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.100
 Which one is cheaper then use. No one is stupid. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.940
 China imports a large amount of grain from the US, Brazil and many other countries, 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.620
 This affects not only global food prices, but also Chinese farmers. This is also the cause of the food crisis in China. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.880
 Many people are concerned that, once international sanctions are issued to China, food security will not be promising. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.460
 Mao Yu said that, if this happens, the Chinese government is the biggest perpetrator. 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.840
 Even if there is enough food, people's lives are not improved. 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.520
 At the end of 2013, Party leader - Xi Jinping spoke at Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences that: 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.400
 "Holding food in hand, there is nothing to be afraid of." But once hunger happens, there's no use for money. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.520
 In mid-December 2013, according to an economic meeting, food security was a top priority in 2014. 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.640
 The goal is to achieve "food self-sufficiency" and "import regulation". 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.620
 At the end of December 2013, 7 permanent committee members again emphasized the issue of food security. 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.440
 Requirement to ensure absolute cereal self-sufficiency and food security, not to touch the alarm level. 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.640
 By January 19, the Chinese Communist Party once again brought food security to the top priority. 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.540
 Zhang Kai, a Chinese agricultural biology engineering scholar, pointed out that China's continued emphasis on the importance of food shows that the food crisis is approaching. 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 However, he has yet to see any specific settlement plan. 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.980
 [Truong Khai] "The government always avoids an important problem, in order to produce food, land and water are needed. 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.400
 If the problem of land and water pollution is not addressed, then the food problem cannot be solved either. " 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.540
 In 2013, lawyers asked the government to publicly report a survey of soil pollution that cost 1 billion yuan. 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.120
 But the Ministry of Environment refused, citing this as a national secret. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.500
 At the end of 2013, Deputy Minister of Land and Environment said that due to serious pollution, there will be about 3.3 million hectares of un-cultivated land.
