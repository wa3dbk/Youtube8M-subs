to<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:02.730> earthquake<00:00:02.939> spell<00:00:03.210> tutorial<00:00:04.160> so<00:00:05.160> I've

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
to my earthquake spell tutorial so I've

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.889 
to my earthquake spell tutorial so I've
had<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> lot<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.580> questions<00:00:05.759> recently<00:00:06.390> asking

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
had a lot of questions recently asking

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.960 
had a lot of questions recently asking
when<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> use<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.010> earthquake<00:00:08.370> spell<00:00:08.670> is

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
when do you use the earthquake spell is

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.870 
when do you use the earthquake spell is
it<00:00:09.210> actually<00:00:09.510> any<00:00:09.660> good<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:10.019> clan<00:00:10.290> wars<00:00:10.320> and

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
it actually any good in clan wars and

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.249 
it actually any good in clan wars and
can<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:11.969> ever<00:00:12.120> use<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.450> instead<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.809> taking<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
can you ever use it instead of taking a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.140 
can you ever use it instead of taking a
jump<00:00:13.469> spell<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> wanted<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> bring<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.000> an

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
jump spell so I wanted to bring you an

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
jump spell so I wanted to bring you an
attack<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.440> war<00:00:16.740> which<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> Hebrew

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
attack from this war which was a Hebrew

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.460 
attack from this war which was a Hebrew
legacy<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> feeder<00:00:19.080> clan<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
legacy which is the feeder clan the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.340 
legacy which is the feeder clan the
Hebrew<00:00:19.710> legends<00:00:20.039> against<00:00:20.789> center<00:00:21.180> Mirena<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
Hebrew legends against center Mirena it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.689 
Hebrew legends against center Mirena it
was<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> fun<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:22.980> me<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> watch<00:00:23.310> because

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
was a lot of fun for me to watch because

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.099 
was a lot of fun for me to watch because
some<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.180> might<00:00:24.359> know<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> used<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.869> part

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
some of you might know I used to be part

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.960 
some of you might know I used to be part
of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> centum<00:00:25.590> family<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.369> actually<00:00:26.550> ward

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of the centum family and I actually ward

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
of the centum family and I actually ward
with<00:00:27.180> arena<00:00:27.420> quite<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.830> cool<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with arena quite a lot so it was cool to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
with arena quite a lot so it was cool to
watch<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> attacks<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.820> particularly

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
watch all the attacks and particularly

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.920 
watch all the attacks and particularly
because<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> attack<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> served<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.520> on

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
because of the attack that served it on

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.860 
because of the attack that served it on
this<00:00:33.930> space<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.980> number<00:00:35.130> 14<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this space the number 14 so if we have a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.569 
this space the number 14 so if we have a
quick<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.500> base<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.489> got

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
quick look at this base it's a it's got

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.600 
quick look at this base it's a it's got
a<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.879> popular<00:00:39.629> central<00:00:40.469> principle<00:00:40.860> which

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a very popular central principle which

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
a very popular central principle which
is<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.120> offset<00:00:42.629> Queen<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.170> she's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is you have an offset Queen so she's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
is you have an offset Queen so she's
over<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.710> side<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> double<00:00:44.489> giant

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
over one side and then the double giant

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
over one side and then the double giant
bombs<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> here

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
bombs are here and here

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
bombs are here and here
now<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> base<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> trying<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> force

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
now what this base is trying to force

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
now what this base is trying to force
you<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> attacker<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> hit<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> from

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you the attacker to do is hit it from

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
you the attacker to do is hit it from
this<00:00:50.430> side<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> arch<00:00:52.440> Queen

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this side so that you get the arch Queen

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
this side so that you get the arch Queen
but<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> prevents<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.120> getting<00:00:54.390> either

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but it prevents you from getting either

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
but it prevents you from getting either
set<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.260> double<00:00:55.500> jump<00:00:55.710> bombs<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.100> means

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
set of double jump bombs which means

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.740 
set of double jump bombs which means
that<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> any<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.480> hog<00:00:57.629> attack

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
that if you do any kind of hog attack

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
that if you do any kind of hog attack
whether<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> surgical<00:00:58.680> deployment<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
whether it's a surgical deployment or a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
whether it's a surgical deployment or a
wave<00:00:59.760> or<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.329> finger<00:01:00.570> drop<00:01:00.719> doesn't<00:01:01.170> matter

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
wave or two finger drop doesn't matter

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
wave or two finger drop doesn't matter
you're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.609> over<00:01:02.820> both

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you're going to have to go over both

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.189 
you're going to have to go over both
sets<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> double<00:01:03.480> giant<00:01:03.690> bombs<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.110> your

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
sets of double giant bombs with your

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
sets of double giant bombs with your
hogs<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.250> enough<00:01:05.489> left

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
hogs and you will not have enough left

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
hogs and you will not have enough left
to<00:01:05.790> three-star<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> base<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.350> quite<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to three-star the base so it's quite a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.399 
to three-star the base so it's quite a
clever<00:01:07.799> base<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.970> what's<00:01:09.540> ever<00:01:09.780> realizes<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
clever base but what's ever realizes is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
clever base but what's ever realizes is
if<00:01:10.680> he<00:01:10.799> takes<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.130> jump<00:01:11.400> spell<00:01:11.580> he<00:01:12.150> could<00:01:12.360> make

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
if he takes a jump spell he could make

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
if he takes a jump spell he could make
me<00:01:12.840> jump<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> wall<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.189> wall<00:01:14.400> but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
me jump that wall or or that wall but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
me jump that wall or or that wall but
it's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> wear<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.659> by<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.650> he

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's going to wear off by the time he

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's going to wear off by the time he
tries<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> either<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.509> set<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.780> double

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
tries to get to either one set of double

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.690 
tries to get to either one set of double
jump<00:01:19.200> bombs<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> Queen<00:01:20.070> he<00:01:20.340> isn't<00:01:20.580> going

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
jump bombs or the Queen he isn't going

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
jump bombs or the Queen he isn't going
to<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.850> both<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:21.990> realizes<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.979> he

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to get both so what he realizes is if he

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
to get both so what he realizes is if he
removes<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.720> walls<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.740> court

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
removes all these walls in the court

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740

and then heal them as they go around the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.209 
and then heal them as they go around the
base<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.049> let's<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.219> watch<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.329> attack

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
base so let's have a watch of the attack

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.410 
base so let's have a watch of the attack
so<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> first<00:01:59.549> thing<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.210> is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so the first thing we're going to see is

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
so the first thing we're going to see is
the<00:02:00.810> use<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.860> earthquake<00:02:02.520> spells<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the use of the earthquake spells so in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.749 
the use of the earthquake spells so in
go<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.219> four<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.979> down<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:08.520> walls

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
go all four and down go all those walls

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.370 
go all four and down go all those walls
and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.340> two<00:02:12.060> golems

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and then in go two golems

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.910 
and then in go two golems
so<00:02:14.150> they're<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.540> through<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.810> wall<00:02:16.170> he

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so they're going in through that wall he

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
so they're going in through that wall he
pops<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.730> couple<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.210> wizards<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.660> top

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
pops in a couple of wizards at the top

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
pops in a couple of wizards at the top

he's got five witches the reason for

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.030 
he's got five witches the reason for
that<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.020> because<00:02:28.080> they're<00:02:28.710> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> produce

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that is because they're going to produce

that is because they're going to produce
enough<00:02:29.370> skeletons<00:02:29.820> when<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.210> into<00:02:30.360> the

wizards left as well he's even got a
poison<00:03:45.930> spot<00:03:46.110> left<00:03:46.230> over<00:03:46.410> which<00:03:46.530> I'd<00:03:46.650> have

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
poison spot left over which I'd have

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.950 
poison spot left over which I'd have
probably<00:03:46.890> used<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.820> those<00:03:48.180> loons<00:03:48.690> at<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
probably used on on those loons at the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.690 
probably used on on those loons at the
start<00:03:49.760> but<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.820> doesn't<00:03:51.150> really<00:03:51.270> matter<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
start but it doesn't really matter and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.020 
start but it doesn't really matter and
that<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.000> how<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.240> use<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:55.050> earthquake<00:03:55.500> spell

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
that is how to use the earthquake spell

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.130 
that is how to use the earthquake spell
so<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.240> you<00:03:57.330> have<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> base<00:03:57.660> which<00:03:57.870> looks<00:03:58.080> like

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
so if you have a base which looks like

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.720 
so if you have a base which looks like
this<00:03:58.350> with<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.950> an<00:03:59.040> offset<00:03:59.160> Queen<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.670> then

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
this with with an offset Queen and then

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.980 
this with with an offset Queen and then
double<00:04:00.000> giant<00:04:00.120> bombs<00:04:00.240> over<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.660> other<00:04:00.780> side

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
double giant bombs over the other side

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.500 
double giant bombs over the other side
then<00:04:01.410> see<00:04:01.920> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.130> can<00:04:02.160> spot<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.790> point<00:04:03.270> in<00:04:03.420> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
then see if you can spot a point in the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.030 
then see if you can spot a point in the
middle<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> base<00:04:04.080> which<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.560> could<00:04:04.710> open

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
middle of the base which you could open

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.370 
middle of the base which you could open
up<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.190> core<00:04:05.460> from<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.810> give<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> shot

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
up the core from and and give it a shot

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.810 
up the core from and and give it a shot
and<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.740> I<00:04:07.830> say<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.010> don't<00:04:08.220> even<00:04:08.460> need<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.730> be

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
