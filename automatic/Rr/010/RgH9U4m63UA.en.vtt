00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 protected burns that ties in our hands 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 secure phone that looks like 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.670
 enough standards for its type 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 however, he was able to please us

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.850
 it would be nice to see a carbine for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.390
 It looks exactly as it should 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 protected phone this brutal 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 a bar of plastic immediately gives customized

 severity plastic case 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.210
 retention arms have lateral faces 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.339
 adding sustainability when using 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.890
 frontal surface represents 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.650
 a classic phone logo enemies 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 divides the surface into two sections 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.850
 the top is a speaker 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.619
 The screen is protected and strong glass at the bottom 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 the whole control unit is located and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.670
 microphone joystick made in the form 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020
 large ring and center button with 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.150
 small texture of small 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 triangles the remaining buttons have 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.590
 Small convex profile and comfortable 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 all elements are pressed clearly visible 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.619
 in bright light in the dark 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.960
 helps orienting soft 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 backlight on the back immediately 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040
 striking device cover 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 closed by two screws above you can see 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.729
 1 3 megapixel camera peephole hidden 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
 deep inside the body 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 a lattice protrudes above the surface 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.850
 hiding perforation under the main 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 speaker for mounting mounts on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.420
 the bottom is provided on the slot with 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 on the left side you can see the button 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.280
 activation flashlight anapa rubber and for 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.439
 pressing requires little effort on 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 the right side of the elements is much more in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.829
 the first is split keys 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.140
 volume control and movement 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.640
 the menu above them is located under the output everywhere 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.840
 By the way, the phone can be easily 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.209
 use as external 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 battery power bank charging others 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.170
 devices at the very bottom can be nested 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 dock connector 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.400
 the lower bound is located at the exit for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.230
 micro USB closed rubber plug 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.239
 it is worth considering that the connector itself is located 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.739
 deep enough so not every 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.569
 cable is suitable because of the thickness 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.940
 from above you can see a stub for 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.010
 headphone jack notice big 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.480
 flashlight is also impossible, unlike 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 simple led solutions in 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.160
 most smartphones and easy to 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.230
 Roger flashlight phone 150 rd very 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 powerful and beats light tens of meters 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.530
 forward he has 4 modes of operation 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.660
 weak strong signal sos and strobe 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.340
 by the way even after the phone 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.500
 you can fully discharge the flashlight 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.299
 use a long time in hand 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.459
 the phone is pretty sure about 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.130
 quite large thickness well 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.810
 feel and weight of 165 grams and here 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.459
 guess at first on a bruise 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.650
 the location of the side buttons is enough 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.480
 difficult yet a single rubber coating 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.950
 and uneven profile makes itself felt 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.870
 that is, you initially think that this 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.489
 button and in the end just a projection like 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.200
 relies on this type of device 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.540
 the phone is fortified well enough to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.470
 survive a series of serious blows 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.810
 not only rubber contributes to this 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.489
 inserts but also durable plastic of course 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.560
 after the fall one way or another remain 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.049
 traces of use but the material itself 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.459
 does not crack and this is important when 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.530
 using the format of the hand is not from that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.510
 places that I practiced down period 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.370
 testing on the case remained a number 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.500
 noticeable scratches but glass on 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.390
 surprise somewhat and went nowhere 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500
 protection standard a and peace index 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870
 of 68 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.700
 that is, not only complete dust protection 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.769
 but also when diving under pressure on 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.230
 depth of more than one meter to sink 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.420
 jar apparatus or aquariums did not become 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.920
 it is destiny sony presentation but 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.260
 freeze it in the fridge 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.060
 it is no problem after hours 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.620
 presence in icebound condition 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.329
 the unit still took calls 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.010
 the gadget is designed for long 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.799
 use in temperature conditions from 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.810
 minus 20 to 60 degrees so our test 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.120
 seemed to phone a trip to the store for 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.950
 the stated degree of protection is assumed 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.290
 Use a sturdy, closed lid with 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.389
 rubberized perimeter main stop 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 done on the top two screws that time 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.049
 as the bottom tightly goes inside 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.850
 with the protrusions here's a cover more 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.620
 part takes a large battery under 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.690
 which already had connectors under mini 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.299
 sim micro sim and micro sd 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.039
 terms of sound everything is quite fun in 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.140
 First there is support for working with FM radio 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.500
 without connecting a wired headset 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.570
 I certainly understand 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.130
 Radio is not popular at all now but for 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.530
 attacks on nature without in any way 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.460
 secondly Vergie 150 is very loud 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.280
 speaker according to specifications 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.260
 working above 90 decibels its quality 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.050
 mean however to create good 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.730
 background in the company is quite suitable reverse 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.740
 minus can be noted a little amount 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.120
 power gradations in the end even the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.970
 minimal installation in a quiet room 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.930
 turns into a passing train in 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.180
 case with spoken speaker 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.100
 it turns out a similar situation when 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.900
 maximum volume quality is not the same 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.730
 better interlocutor gets harder 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.100
 understand lowering the bar everything becomes 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.890
 better screen phone simple type 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.840
 matrix with a resolution of 177 by 220 pixels 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.669
 finding fault with the quality of the flowers or 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.130
 inverting the image in this kind 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.500
 devices inappropriate the main thing is good 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.300
 brightness and it is there in the phone 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.760
 mediatek mtk 6735 processor installed 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.919
 time for our guest in terms of posture everything 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.750
 minimalist enough at the beginning 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.610
 screen displays information about current 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.070
 connections missed messages and 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.020
 Of course, the big clock with the date go 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.090
 You can either in your address book or in general 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.770
 menus with categories other than standard 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.990
 telephone capability to answer especially 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.270
 nothing there is a calendar calculator with 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.830
 the ability to create events alarm 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.450
 of the additional worth highlighting 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.520
 application for mending texts of books 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.890
 file manager and one race toy 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.020
 Alas, the platform does not support f1 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.610
 installation supporter jar applications so 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.260
 that expand the standard set of its 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.090
 favorite programs will not work 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.830
 one of the main pieces of the phone can 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.210
 also call the opportunity to perform in 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.610
 form a bluetooth remote for your 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.169
 smartphone after pairing devices 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.150
 roger get access to call history 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.190
 and address book due to the lack of 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.290
 the possibility to have any around in 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.890
 device it and it will make life easier for many 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.780
 users 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.030
 SMS can also be taken but after 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.919
 special application downloads when 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.540
 call setup, you can choose which 7 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.850
 produce it the same function 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.100
 used to transform rogy orgy 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.710
 150 into a portable music column with 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.900
 running the tracks from it batteries like 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.880
 relies an impressive capacity of 2400 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.320
 milliamper hours for regular phones 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.120
 in fact is rather big 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.310
 ensuring smooth operation on 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.479
 for several weeks and even 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.890
 we activate the opportunity 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.830
 bluetooth headset anyway get 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.150
 decent travel companions 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.430
 playing with the capabilities of the device i am so 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.440
 and could not put him behind her 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.090
 or eventually after a long acquaintance 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.130
 with the device there was a very funny 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.110
 This situation is essentially very simple. 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.840
 the apparatus I get more emotions than 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.310
 smartphone for the same cost yes he 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.870
 pretty simple can't go out 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.210
 okay in social networks to shoot 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.310
 beautiful pictures but has a number of good ones 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.800
 making as a companion besides his 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.450
 and it is worth considering roger and g 150 it 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.270
 good secure phone for quite 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.250
 imputed money 5 990 rubles means
