was<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.690> fact<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.410> was<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.800> very<00:01:46.100> diverse

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
was the fact that it was a very diverse

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.660 
was the fact that it was a very diverse
setting<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:47.750> meant<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.440> needed<00:01:49.310> some

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
setting which meant that it needed some

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.620

we are working together with a very very
very<00:02:01.490> good<00:02:01.640> sound<00:02:02.090> team<00:02:02.330> here<00:02:02.720> in<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.990> IO<00:02:03.410> and

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
very good sound team here in the IO and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.560 
very good sound team here in the IO and
they<00:02:03.860> are<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.640> they're<00:02:04.910> really<00:02:05.150> good<00:02:05.330> at

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
they are you know they're really good at

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.920 
they are you know they're really good at
understanding<00:02:06.340> how<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.370> fit<00:02:07.910> every<00:02:08.600> little

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
understanding how to fit every little

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.890 
understanding how to fit every little
bit<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.140> music<00:02:09.440> element<00:02:10.130> with<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> AI<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
bit of music element with the AI so you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.450 
bit of music element with the AI so you
obviously<00:02:12.020> have<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> main<00:02:12.680> scorer<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.340> they

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
obviously have a main scorer but they

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.520 
obviously have a main scorer but they
are<00:02:13.640> very<00:02:13.820> capable<00:02:14.240> at<00:02:14.660> breaking<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.260> score

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
are very capable at breaking that score

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.900 
are very capable at breaking that score
down<00:02:15.710> with<00:02:15.890> different<00:02:16.250> tracks<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.850> are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
down with different tracks that are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.050 
down with different tracks that are
either<00:02:17.480> very<00:02:17.690> ambient<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> AI<00:02:19.670> or

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
either very ambient like the AI or

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.450 
either very ambient like the AI or
action<00:02:20.810> based<00:02:21.020> or<00:02:21.320> fast<00:02:21.620> paced<00:02:21.920> tracks<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
action based or fast paced tracks and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.220 
action based or fast paced tracks and
they<00:02:22.850> really<00:02:23.240> understand<00:02:23.600> how<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> blend<00:02:24.020> this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
they really understand how to blend this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.180 
they really understand how to blend this
seamlessly<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:27.110> way<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.410> handle<00:02:27.740> dialogue

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
seamlessly the way we handle dialogue

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.790 
seamlessly the way we handle dialogue
this<00:02:28.610> time<00:02:28.880> around<00:02:29.030> has<00:02:29.959> been<00:02:30.200> quite

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
this time around has been quite

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.010 
this time around has been quite
different<00:02:31.250> compared<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> other

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
different compared to to the other

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.500 
different compared to to the other
hitman<00:02:33.350> games<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.790> have<00:02:35.030> had<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
hitman games in that we have had the
