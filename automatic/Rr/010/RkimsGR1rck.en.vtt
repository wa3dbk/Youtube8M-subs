gonna be down 100 points I think we're
actually<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.540> were<00:00:15.630> down<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:16.520> 107<00:00:17.520> points<00:00:17.699> or

actually we were down like 107 points or

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.250 
actually we were down like 107 points or
something<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.300> started<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> video<00:00:18.960> but

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
something when I started the video but

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.359 
something when I started the video but
anyway<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.590> was<00:00:19.710> supposed<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> be<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> hundred

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
anyway it was supposed to be a hundred

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.410 
anyway it was supposed to be a hundred
you<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.760> always<00:00:21.439> exact<00:00:22.850> but<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> think

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you know it's always exact but I think

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.990 
you know it's always exact but I think
I'll<00:00:24.510> try<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.840> sure<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.170> always<00:00:25.350> like

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000

either what I say it's gonna be or over
that<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> will<00:00:29.640> never<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:30.000> less<00:00:30.210> than<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that I will never be less than what I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.790 
that I will never be less than what I
say<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.550> anyways<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.469> 100<00:00:34.469> points

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it's a little bit different as well this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's a little bit different as well this
isn't<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.280> emoji<00:00:38.550> map<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.059> anything<00:00:39.090> like

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that but you know I decided to do this

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.389 
that but you know I decided to do this
in<00:00:41.370> 66<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> first<00:00:42.540> installment<00:00:43.399> simply

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
don't know so you know that you can't
exactly<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> random<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
exactly be a random and get that so that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.770 
exactly be a random and get that so that
we<00:01:17.580> noticed<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.720> were

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we noticed that I was that they were

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
we noticed that I was that they were
kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.170> trying<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.920> hard<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
kind of like trying a little bit hard to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
kind of like trying a little bit hard to
just<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.180> Randy<00:01:21.540> dandies<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
just be like you know Randy dandies so I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020 
just be like you know Randy dandies so I
checked<00:01:23.220> after<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:23.939> were

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
checked after the game and they were

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.350 
checked after the game and they were
indeed<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.600> six-man<00:01:24.930> party<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.820> think

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
indeed in this six-man party and I think

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
indeed in this six-man party and I think
I<00:01:27.630> believe<00:01:28.560> these<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> kids<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I believe these are the kids like one of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
I believe these are the kids like one of
them<00:01:29.820> knew<00:01:30.000> who<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.900> he<00:01:31.110> messaged<00:01:31.470> him

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
them knew who I was and he messaged him

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
them knew who I was and he messaged him
after<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> game<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.070> something<00:01:32.340> anyway<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
after the game or something anyway so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.550 
after the game or something anyway so
that's<00:01:33.689> why<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.869> were<00:01:33.960> trying<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.409> bit

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that's why they were trying a little bit

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
that's why they were trying a little bit
harder<00:01:34.860> than<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> normal<00:01:36.150> group<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
harder than you know a normal group of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.859 
harder than you know a normal group of
people<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.799> anyways<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.759> won<00:01:39.000> pretty<00:01:39.450> easily

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
people but anyways we won pretty easily

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
people but anyways we won pretty easily
I<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.100> beat<00:01:41.280> them<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I would say I think we beat them like I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.800 
I would say I think we beat them like I
want<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> say<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.280> 252<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:45.630> right

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
want to say like 252 like like right

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.060 
want to say like 252 like like right
there<00:01:45.990> look<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.259> got<00:01:46.500> jump<00:01:46.770> shadow<00:01:46.950> by

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
there look I just got jump shadow by

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
there look I just got jump shadow by
split-screen<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.030> crazy

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
split-screen really that's crazy

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.460 
split-screen really that's crazy
but<00:01:49.369> then<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.820> 250<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.659> 120

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but then we go in like 250 to like 120

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.490 
but then we go in like 250 to like 120
or<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.990> wasn't

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
or so it's not like that so it wasn't

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.249 
or so it's not like that so it wasn't
really<00:01:55.530> too<00:01:56.280> much<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> struggle<00:01:57.079> by<00:01:58.079> any

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
really too much of a struggle by any

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
really too much of a struggle by any
means<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.740> definitely<00:01:59.369> got<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> comeback

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
means we definitely got the comeback

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
means we definitely got the comeback
pretty<00:02:00.390> solid<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.649> other<00:02:01.770> than<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> that's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
pretty solid but other than that that's

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.200 
pretty solid but other than that that's
first<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:02.729> need<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.090> about

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.639 
first of all I really need to say about
the<00:02:03.329> gameplay<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.750> guys<00:02:03.930> wouldn't<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.530> in

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the gameplay you guys wouldn't see in

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
the gameplay you guys wouldn't see in
the<00:02:04.770> background<00:02:04.950> there<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> talk

other game modes and stuff

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.140 
other game modes and stuff
what<00:02:13.770> I've<00:02:13.890> decided<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.580> I'm<00:02:15.060> gonna

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
what I've decided to do is I'm gonna

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.020 
what I've decided to do is I'm gonna
finish<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.810> whole<00:02:16.020> 66<00:02:16.770> series<00:02:17.160> there's

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
finish out this whole 66 series there's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.370 
finish out this whole 66 series there's
gonna<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.390> five<00:02:18.630> episodes<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.260> so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
gonna be like five episodes or so

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.559 
gonna be like five episodes or so
something<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.489> after<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> finished

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
something like that and after I finished

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.540 
something like that and after I finished
the<00:02:21.690> first<00:02:21.959> installment<00:02:22.410> I'll<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the first installment I'll do like I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.250 
the first installment I'll do like I
guess<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.970> season<00:02:24.330> two<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.720> something<00:02:25.050> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
guess like a season two or something and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.589 
guess like a season two or something and
I'm<00:02:26.040> gonna<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> different<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.330> mode

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
I'm gonna do it in a different game mode

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.000 
I'm gonna do it in a different game mode
so<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.260> next<00:02:28.500> thing<00:02:28.560> I'll<00:02:28.739> do<00:02:28.890> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
so I think the next thing I'll do is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.350 
so I think the next thing I'll do is
I'll<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.459> league<00:02:29.640> play<00:02:29.670> hard<00:02:30.090> point

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
I'll do it in league play hard point

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
I'll do it in league play hard point
because<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.410> should<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:32.160> guess<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> little

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
because that should be I guess a little

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110 
because that should be I guess a little
bit<00:02:33.209> more<00:02:33.330> challenging<00:02:33.959> slash<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:36.000> bit

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bit more challenging slash a little bit

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.610 
bit more challenging slash a little bit
more<00:02:36.269> entertaining<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.080> know<00:02:37.170> because

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
more entertaining I don't know because

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.660 
more entertaining I don't know because
everyone<00:02:37.890> League<00:02:38.069> place<00:02:38.250> should<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.519> trying

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
everyone League place should be trying

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.970 
everyone League place should be trying
to<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:38.849> for<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> win<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.709> even

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
to go for the win I think you know even

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860 
to go for the win I think you know even
in<00:02:41.160> pubs<00:02:41.430> people<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> most<00:02:42.450> part<00:02:42.660> try<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in pubs people for the most part try to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.440 
in pubs people for the most part try to
get<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.110> win<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:44.340> anyways<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.090> thought<00:02:45.269> that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
get to win but anyways I thought that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720 
get to win but anyways I thought that
would<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.870> should<00:02:46.170> probably<00:02:46.549> be<00:02:47.549> more

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
would out should probably be more

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.400 
would out should probably be more
entertaining<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.269> don't<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:48.780> figured

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
entertaining I don't know but figured

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.380 
entertaining I don't know but figured

was<00:03:08.430> thinking<00:03:08.819> about<00:03:08.880> doing<00:03:09.030> some<00:03:09.360> multi<00:03:09.599> team

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
was thinking about doing some multi team

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.890 
was thinking about doing some multi team
but<00:03:10.310> there's<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:12.060> factor<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.569> third

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
but there's just the factor of the third

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.620 
but there's just the factor of the third
team<00:03:13.200> changes<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.310> much<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:14.819> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
team changes that so much because you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.599 
team changes that so much because you
know<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.950> teams<00:03:17.190> aren't<00:03:17.340> gonna<00:03:17.459> be

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
know that the teams aren't gonna be

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.400 
know that the teams aren't gonna be
getting<00:03:17.820> free<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.600> know<00:03:18.720> time<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> hill

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
getting free you know time on the hill

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.660 
getting free you know time on the hill
there's<00:03:19.650> still<00:03:19.920> gonna<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.130> two<00:03:20.400> teams

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
there's still gonna be two teams

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.300 
there's still gonna be two teams
fighting<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.450> hill<00:03:21.690> even<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:22.980> I'm<00:03:23.130> trying

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
fighting for the hill even if I'm trying

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.979 
fighting for the hill even if I'm trying
to<00:03:23.459> let<00:03:23.609> them<00:03:23.820> win<00:03:24.090> or<00:03:24.269> whatever<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.840> can

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
to let them win or whatever so I can

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.539 
to let them win or whatever so I can
come<00:03:25.170> back<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.709> don't<00:03:26.040> really<00:03:26.160> know<00:03:26.400> how

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
come back so I don't really know how

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.120 
come back so I don't really know how
that's<00:03:26.700> good<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:27.269> work<00:03:27.359> out

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
that's good that would really work out

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.199 
that's good that would really work out
but<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:29.579> far<00:03:29.760> as<00:03:29.819> like<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> good

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
but you know as far as like the good

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.150 
but you know as far as like the good
players<00:03:30.480> thing<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.079> can't<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:31.829> choose

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
players thing like I can't really choose

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.520 
players thing like I can't really choose
who<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.430> play<00:03:32.670> against<00:03:33.060> for<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.260> two

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
who I play against for one and for two

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.460 
who I play against for one and for two
like<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:36.180> know<00:03:36.299> they<00:03:36.510> they<00:03:36.840> can't<00:03:37.109> really<00:03:37.350> be

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
like you know they they can't really be

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.130 
like you know they they can't really be
good<00:03:37.859> players<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.239> certain<00:03:39.720> extent<00:03:40.109> like

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
good players to a certain extent like

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.379 
good players to a certain extent like
they<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.500> be<00:03:40.530> decent<00:03:41.010> or<00:03:41.069> whatever<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
they can be decent or whatever but you

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.970 
they can be decent or whatever but you
know<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:42.600> they're<00:03:42.780> good<00:03:43.019> they're<00:03:43.380> not<00:03:43.590> going

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
know if they're good they're not going

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.309 
know if they're good they're not going
to<00:03:44.010> let<00:03:44.190> me<00:03:44.430> come<00:03:45.030> back<00:03:45.060> 200<00:03:45.840> points<00:03:46.109> on<00:03:46.200> them

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
to let me come back 200 points on them

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.180 
to let me come back 200 points on them
like<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.480> don't<00:03:48.810> really<00:03:49.739> ever<00:03:49.769> see

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
that I don't know but for the most part

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.120 
that I don't know but for the most part
yeah<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.260> don't<00:04:16.380> know<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:16.590> wanted<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:16.979> kind

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
yeah I don't know I just wanted to kind

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.060 
yeah I don't know I just wanted to kind
of<00:04:17.160> clear<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.459> out<00:04:17.669> because<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.560> it's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
of clear that out because you know it's

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.270 
of clear that out because you know it's
I<00:04:20.489> don't<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.530> they<00:04:22.530> they<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.070> good

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
I don't know like they they can be good

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.159 
I don't know like they they can be good
I<00:04:23.340> guess<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:23.700> they<00:04:24.180> they<00:04:24.539> can't<00:04:24.780> be<00:04:24.930> too<00:04:25.140> good

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
I guess but they they can't be too good

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.320 
I guess but they they can't be too good
because<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.070> know

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
because you know

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.850 
because you know
a<00:04:27.419> pretty<00:04:27.780> good<00:04:27.930> player<00:04:28.139> would<00:04:28.409> not<00:04:28.560> let<00:04:28.740> this

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
a pretty good player would not let this

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.619 
a pretty good player would not let this
happen<00:04:29.069> in<00:04:29.310> them<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.729> I<00:04:29.970> don't<00:04:30.300> know<00:04:30.449> that's

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
happen in them so I don't know that's

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.600 
happen in them so I don't know that's
just<00:04:30.720> kind<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.110> way<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.229> look<00:04:31.439> at<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.620> but

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
just kind of the way I look at it but

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.980 
just kind of the way I look at it but
other<00:04:32.789> than<00:04:32.879> that<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.360> think<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.810> should<00:04:33.930> be

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
other than that I think that should be

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.689 
other than that I think that should be
everything<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.319> really<00:04:34.439> needed<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.919> cover<00:04:35.520> up

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
everything I really needed to cover up

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.939 
everything I really needed to cover up
for<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.939> series<00:04:36.300> also<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.349> beginning<00:04:37.439> let

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
for the series also in the beginning let
