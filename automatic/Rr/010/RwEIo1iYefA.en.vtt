00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
for this glitch you will need to have to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.429 
for this glitch you will need to have to
care<00:01:08.850> packages<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> you'll<00:01:10.080> need<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> have

you need to do is have to care packages

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.719 
you need to do is have to care packages
next<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> each<00:01:21.360> other<00:01:21.509> while<00:01:22.140> being<00:01:22.380> hacked

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
next to each other while being hacked

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
next to each other while being hacked
now<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.689> best<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> care<00:01:25.530> package<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
now on it's best if the care package is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
now on it's best if the care package is
on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.220> ground<00:01:26.580> laying<00:01:26.939> flat<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.540> ground

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
on the ground laying flat on the ground

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
on the ground laying flat on the ground
if<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> crooked<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.250> rolled<00:01:29.880> onto

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
if it's like crooked or rolled onto

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
if it's like crooked or rolled onto
another<00:01:30.299> care<00:01:30.570> package<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.009> results

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
another care package the the results

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.020 
another care package the the results
will<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.329> good<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.759> flag

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
will not be good so if you have to flag

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
will not be good so if you have to flag
care<00:01:36.270> packages<00:01:36.659> next<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> each<00:01:37.079> other<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
care packages next to each other it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
care packages next to each other it
doesn't<00:01:38.310> matter<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.640> care<00:01:38.909> package<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
doesn't matter which care package you on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
doesn't matter which care package you on
just<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:40.020> sure<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> care<00:01:40.619> package

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just make sure you get the care package

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.330 
just make sure you get the care package
that<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.119> using<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> once

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that you know you're not using so once

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
that you know you're not using so once
you<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.450> care<00:01:45.659> package<00:01:45.930> start<00:01:46.259> flying

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you get it the care package start flying

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
you get it the care package start flying
now<00:01:46.950> hopefully<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> care<00:01:48.270> package

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
now hopefully if the care package

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
now hopefully if the care package
doesn't<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.380> crazy<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.070> should<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.759> straight

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
doesn't go crazy it should go straight

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.139 
doesn't go crazy it should go straight
upwards<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.740> need<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.149> when

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
upwards and all you need to do is when

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
upwards and all you need to do is when
you<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.509> you're<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.049> height<00:01:55.229> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you think you're at a good height just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.340 
you think you're at a good height just
jump<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> crouch<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.049> crack

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
jump and crouch and this little crack

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.569 
jump and crouch and this little crack
and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> should<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.340> little

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and then you should be in this little

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.870 
and then you should be in this little
garage<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:01.229> cars<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.979> from<00:02:02.549> here<00:02:02.700> you're

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
garage for cars and from here you're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.859 
garage for cars and from here you're
outside<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> map<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:05.240> place<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.420> tack<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
outside the map and place your tack and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
outside the map and place your tack and
then<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.290> explore<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.459> from<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
then you can explore but from here you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150 
then you can explore but from here you
got<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.020> more<00:02:10.110> care<00:02:10.379> package<00:02:10.709> hopping

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
got to do some more care package hopping

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.490 
got to do some more care package hopping
to<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.300> where<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.780> show<00:02:12.959> earlier<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to go on where I show earlier in the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.870 
to go on where I show earlier in the
video

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
video

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.150 
video
and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.840> if<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> want<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> get<00:02:15.350> fully<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.980> top

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and then if you want to get fully on top

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.010 
and then if you want to get fully on top
of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.370> roof<00:02:16.550> all<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.150> need<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.990> a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
of the roof all you need to do is do a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.080 
of the roof all you need to do is do a
care<00:02:18.320> package<00:02:18.470> elevation<00:02:19.310> outside<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.910> map

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
care package elevation outside the map

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.690 
care package elevation outside the map
and<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.930> should<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.290> top<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> roof<00:02:21.830> so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and it should be on top of the roof so

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.300 
and it should be on top of the roof so
it's<00:02:22.970> pretty<00:02:23.150> fun<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.660> pretty<00:02:23.840> easy<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
it's pretty fun and pretty easy this is

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.130 
it's pretty fun and pretty easy this is
definitely<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.730> lot<00:02:25.850> easier<00:02:26.060> than<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.510> wall

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
definitely a lot easier than a wall

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.200 
definitely a lot easier than a wall
breaching<00:02:27.650> because<00:02:28.040> you're<00:02:28.820> actually<00:02:29.000> having

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
fun trying to get on top of the roof

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.320 
fun trying to get on top of the roof
elevation<00:02:31.490> because<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.910> pretty<00:02:32.090> cool

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
elevation because it's a pretty cool

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.420 
elevation because it's a pretty cool
