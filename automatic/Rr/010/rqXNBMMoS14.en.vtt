00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that has an LED built into it so you'll

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.140 
that has an LED built into it so you'll
charge<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.489> thing<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:11.970> you'll<00:02:12.060> get

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
charge this thing up and you'll get

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
charge this thing up and you'll get
several<00:02:12.510> months<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.110> usage

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
several months of usage

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
several months of usage
you're<00:02:13.859> charging<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.730> LED<00:02:15.060> turns<00:02:15.239> red<00:02:15.599> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you're charging the LED turns red and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.390 
you're charging the LED turns red and
then<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.930> goes<00:02:16.109> out<00:02:16.290> completely<00:02:17.129> when<00:02:17.280> it's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
then it goes out completely when it's

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.459 
then it goes out completely when it's
fully<00:02:17.609> charged<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.659> way<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.989> works<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
fully charged now the way this works is

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.440 
fully charged now the way this works is
with<00:02:19.620> these<00:02:19.799> clips<00:02:20.219> right<00:02:20.459> here<00:02:20.670> which<00:02:20.849> rotate

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
with these clips right here which rotate

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.959 
with these clips right here which rotate
up<00:02:21.689> on<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.409> hinges<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.790> now<00:02:23.909> that

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
up on these hinges like so so now that

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.030 
up on these hinges like so so now that
they're<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.540> position<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.829> bring

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
they're in the up position I can bring

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
they're in the up position I can bring
the<00:02:26.159> iPad<00:02:26.609> in<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.629> have<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.989> here<00:02:28.230> with<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the iPad in and I have it here with the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.679 
the iPad in and I have it here with the
button<00:02:28.859> side<00:02:29.069> first<00:02:29.519> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.359> to<00:02:30.450> place<00:02:30.659> it

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
button side first I'm going to place it

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.629 
button side first I'm going to place it
inside<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.889> kind<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.099> clamp<00:02:32.459> it

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
inside and then just kind of clamp it

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.349 
inside and then just kind of clamp it
down<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.139> close<00:02:34.379> it<00:02:34.439> all<00:02:34.739> up<00:02:35.180> right<00:02:36.180> away

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
down so if I close it all up right away

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.270 
down so if I close it all up right away
obviously<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.139> said<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.829> looks<00:02:38.069> like

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
obviously like I said this looks like

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.039 
obviously like I said this looks like
something<00:02:38.760> Apple<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.299> make<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.659> looks<00:02:39.870> like

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
something Apple would make it looks like

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.929 
something Apple would make it looks like

typing on the keyboard and whatnot so
we'll<00:03:45.209> power<00:03:45.419> this<00:03:45.629> thing<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.049> right<00:03:46.079> here

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
we'll power this thing on right here

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.439 
we'll power this thing on right here
there's<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.009> on/off<00:03:47.340> switch<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:47.970> mentioned

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
there's the on/off switch as I mentioned

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.780 
there's the on/off switch as I mentioned
and<00:03:48.650> obviously<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.919> when<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.340> do<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.579> for

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and obviously for when you do this for

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.309 
and obviously for when you do this for
the<00:03:50.849> first<00:03:51.000> time<00:03:51.299> you're<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.079> need<00:03:52.169> to

already done that as you can see I've

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.899 
already done that as you can see I've
paired<00:03:58.379> up<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.739> keyboard<00:03:58.949> so<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.699> works

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
paired up the keyboard so now it works

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
just fine there is a row of iPads

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.969

specific<00:04:02.729> keys<00:04:02.939> across<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.599> top<00:04:03.840> which<00:04:04.829> is

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
specific keys across the top which is

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.249 
specific keys across the top which is
nice<00:04:05.159> they're<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.699> tied<00:04:06.419> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> function

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.589 
nice they're not tied to the function
key<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.769> they're<00:04:08.370> their<00:04:08.790> own<00:04:08.819> keys<00:04:09.209> unlike

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
there's that amount of tactile feedback

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.940 
there's that amount of tactile feedback
it<00:04:34.630> feels<00:04:34.810> really<00:04:35.020> good<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.470> keys<00:04:35.680> aren't

keyboard that I have reviewed but you

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.610 
keyboard that I have reviewed but you
know<00:06:28.090> I've<00:06:28.360> always<00:06:28.570> said<00:06:28.840> good<00:06:29.050> things<00:06:29.110> cost

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
know I've always said good things cost

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.130 
know I've always said good things cost
more<00:06:30.150> however<00:06:31.150> it's<00:06:31.360> very<00:06:31.450> heavy

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
more however it's very heavy

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.420 
more however it's very heavy
I'd<00:06:32.290> be<00:06:32.410> the<00:06:32.500> other<00:06:32.590> thing<00:06:32.680> I'd<00:06:32.950> worry<00:06:33.100> about

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
I'd be the other thing I'd worry about

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.970 
I'd be the other thing I'd worry about
this<00:06:33.910> is<00:06:34.120> substantial<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:35.050> feels<00:06:35.320> as<00:06:35.500> much<00:06:35.740> if

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
this is substantial it feels as much if

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.060 
this is substantial it feels as much if
not<00:06:36.280> more<00:06:36.490> than<00:06:37.180> an<00:06:37.750> 11<00:06:38.110> inch<00:06:38.260> MacBook
