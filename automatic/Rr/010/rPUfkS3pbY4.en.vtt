00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello my name is lucas xenon del canal and 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 Cléa every week we have videos. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 then about health and medicine tips 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 aesthetic beauty and healthy weight loss 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.250
 So this week's network, we'll go 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 talk about dark circles under 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 perp orbicular hyperpigmentation if you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.099
 start thinking everyone has oneiros 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.480
 famous people of the media 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.399
 celebrities can see if you see a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 photo of her without makeup you go 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.660
 realize that it also has dark circles 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 the dark circles are the pigmentation of the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 eyelids of the region there below the eye 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 then it happens because of two 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.940
 reasons the first reason then is the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.010
 reason for the region to be very vascularized 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 if you see there are many vases 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.989
 blood vessels passing through 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 there and also the skin of the eyelid is the skin 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 the finer our body can stop for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.339
 think and leave all skin our body 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.049
 if you pick up the skin of the eyelid it is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 extremely thin film of less than 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.340
 then joining mm below 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 quite a lot of blood vessels 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.220
 along with a very thin skin and Tai O 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 vascular mechanism of the threshold 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 cause of dark circles is the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 mechanism of hyperpigmentation as if 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.030
 was any other region of the skin 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.700
 caused by the sun with ronai stains 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 be spots caused by smoking 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 alcoholism then this line is the second 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.390
 That's why we 'll go later. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 see in the treatment you have 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.240
 treatments for the olive area that are 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 focused on the part of the spot and has other 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 focused on the vascular part of the eye 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.210
 genetic inheritance if you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.159
 stop to repair 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.860
 You will see that there are families that have 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.229
 tendency to theory mainly to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.570
 of the vascular type that the woman 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.969
 which appears mainly in childhood and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
 that treatment is more difficult the law 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.280
 this mechanism because of the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.719
 blood is passing behind the skin 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.039
 olheira is also developed by 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.259
 deposition of a pigment 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.069
 the hemosiderin inhibition that comes 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.140
 of blood 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.709
 so every time the blood goes by 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.480
 there in the back of the eyelid will 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.150
 leaving a little impediment in a 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.290
 lina lance which is a part of the blood 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.629
 so that's why we'll see later. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.689
 in Brazilian treatments that have a 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.180
 type of lyre caused by the Basque 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.340
 will be being treated with the acid that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.290
 there is exactly this pigment of 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
 hemosiderin then the factors that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.639
 dehydrate end up getting worse 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.389
 that aspect of dark circles 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.790
 why then does the alcoholism 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.829
 increased dark circles also smoking 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.590
 ends up reducing the vascularity in that 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.980
 leaving the region more 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.950
 dehydrated 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.709
 inappropriate diet adequate sony will 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.680
 dehydration of that region 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.780
 there and I also do not know if you knew more 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.639
 people who have a lot of ritchie do not know if 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.040
 also saw the person has a lot of wealth 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.709
 with a lot of nasal congestion she finishes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.810
 with edema there in the region of 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.269
 also dark circles in person who snores 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.829
 enough also have dark circles around 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.349
 of this nasal congestion 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.449
 some drugs mainly 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.849
 eye drops and antipsychotics can also 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.040
 increase dark circles in relation to 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.560
 treatment there are treatments that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.690
 acts on the vascular part and part of 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.579
 hyperpigmentation in relation to the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.959
 That's why you 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.560
 understands that it is very important always 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.319
 Properly hydrated sleep does not stay 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.510
 turning nights sleep everything diet 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.459
 adequate will also help vascularize 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.620
 better that region by reducing 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.849
 of dark circles in relation to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.549
 vascular 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.829
 there is an acid an act called acid 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.109
 thioglycolic is a subject so he 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.389
 has the ability to remove that species 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.319
 that had been deposited by the 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.970
 blood 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.519
 So how does it work? 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.459
 be using this subject at home in 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.090
 regions it will pass a thin layer 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.819
 wake up in the morning 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.159
 lava region and see that slowly 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.199
 gradually bleaching happens 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.419
 of the dark circles, another form of 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.120
 to use the thioglycolic steel in the form of pine 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.430
 in the office with your doctor then 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.039
 doctor is to clean the area and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.260
 will put the acid it at the moment can 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.700
 to give 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.830
 a little stony a bit of 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.570
 redness but it is very quiet in 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.700
 so we think a lot 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.370
 aggressive and also after several 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.920
 sessions at intervals of 15 days, she 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.950
 to be reducing the dark circles 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.290
 the problem of the glycolic doha city is 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.990
 that it has a very very bad smell is 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.970
 the smell of sulfur from the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.860
 accident and sulfur colic then 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.810
 a very unpleasant smell 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.120
 there are people who go to sleep and just not 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.430
 bearing their own smell because of 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.280
 cases to us then where it is already a 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.890
 treatment for the part of the joint is 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.380
 caused by excess melanin are 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.610
 used bleaching agents 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.340
 basically the same ones used for easy 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.740
 as hydroquinone glycolic acid 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.950
 We can be doing kójico too. 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.690
 use of laser as the laser works then 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.840
 mainly pulsed 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.330
 he acts by soothing to heaven what causes 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.280
 hyperpigmentation that the minor can then 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.340
 can be made us forced too 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.800
 interval of 15 days or even less 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.610
 who will be reducing the scourge for 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.170
 cause of pigmentation mechanism 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.510
 practically everybody has some of the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.240
 two mechanisms both vascular and 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.890
 mechanism of hyperpigmentation 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.060
 that is important is associating the two 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.340
 right treatments 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.830
 and always always very important in the case 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.290
 always have to be doing 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.330
 long-term treatment such as 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.790
 vascularization is always there we 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.460
 end up catching sun has the actors of 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.200
 everyday stress bad food then 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.840
 always have one of the factors that are 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.520
 then forming a treatment scout 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.740
 It's not something you're going to do. 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.750
 better and I'm going to give up everything not 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.390
 You always have to keep going. 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.220
 always doing something to advocate 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.080
 and lightening and after this 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.700
 result also can not relax has 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.980
 that to continue the treatment then this 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.170
 it was the video on dark circles this week 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.000
 every week with new videos 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.130
 If you liked, click the enjoy button. 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.140
 which helps the channel a lot 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.250
 if you are not registered also 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.740
 inscribes that you will be receiving 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.900
 directly in the sowing all new 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.790
 videos that have been coming out here have 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.620
 any doubt any suggestion that is 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.540
 tell your experience 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.940
 leave in the comments that have be 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.310
 company that is going to be very relevant 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.320
 So this was the video this week a 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.320
 strong hug until the next
