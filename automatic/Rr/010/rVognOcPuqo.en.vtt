00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.190
 so we have then this is the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.190
 muscle 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.090
 this is the extensor stripe along the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 champion this among the extensive what 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.470
 go to the short 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.470
 to not complicate much 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.480
 of the fingers 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.950
 and although this law as an appetizer 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.950
 pinkie extender 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.950
 this is the long doctor of the thumb and the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.540
 short doctors 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.540
 this is the extensive 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.920
 long 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.840
 this is the radial extender of capital 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 this 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.670
 why 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:33.200
 we see this is the round round 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.799
 this is the radiant sun flexor what 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.630
 will leave like this one which longer and 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.909
 this the ulnar flexors that what 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.320
 we had seen let's see this other 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.320
 very close trio 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.140
 this on the surface confirms the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.659
 surface of loteo and below 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.929
 for work is so deep 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.740
 we already have down the median nerve 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.740
 it would be what is in the middle 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.470
 flexor digitorum profundus and this is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.420
 the one that we supposedly have doubts is the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.610
 long sex the point we have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.610
 because you do not notice 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.870
 we deduce by the location of the blacks 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.870
 and move them later
