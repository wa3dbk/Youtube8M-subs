see<00:05:17.619> he's<00:05:17.889> already<00:05:18.039> created<00:05:18.399> this<00:05:18.460> level

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
see he's already created this level

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.309

multiple<00:05:19.449> levels<00:05:19.749> by<00:05:19.869> the<00:05:19.899> way<00:05:20.020> cuz<00:05:20.199> it's

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
multiple levels by the way cuz it's

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.439 
multiple levels by the way cuz it's
three-dimensional<00:05:20.919> so<00:05:21.159> I<00:05:21.189> can<00:05:21.759> take<00:05:21.969> this<00:05:22.180> and

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
three-dimensional so I can take this and

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.939 
three-dimensional so I can take this and
zoom<00:05:23.199> around<00:05:24.240> up<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.509> down<00:05:25.659> and<00:05:26.349> all<00:05:26.889> around
