well as stretch and I think that's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
well as stretch and I think that's
extremely<00:01:19.799> crucial<00:01:20.159> especially<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
extremely crucial especially when you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
extremely crucial especially when you
swim<00:01:21.210> long<00:01:21.780> course<00:01:22.140> meters<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.799> very

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
swim long course meters that's very

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
swim long course meters that's very
important<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.759> long<00:01:24.000> lean<00:01:24.330> muscle<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
important to have long lean muscle and I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.230 
important to have long lean muscle and I

we use the vasa trainer on a regular
basis<00:01:50.280> three<00:01:50.790> times<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.240> week

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
basis three times a week

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.499 
basis three times a week
we<00:01:52.500> feel<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.369> specific<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
we feel that it's very specific to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.320 
we feel that it's very specific to
swimming<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.860> far<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> catch<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.119> far

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
swimming as far as the catch and as far

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.960 
swimming as far as the catch and as far
as<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> finish<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> stroke<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.820> what<00:01:59.820> we

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
as the finish of the stroke and what we

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.910 
as the finish of the stroke and what we
like<00:02:00.150> about<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.500> gradually

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
like about it is that you can gradually

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.190 
like about it is that you can gradually
increase<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.520> resistance<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.600> can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
increase the resistance you can

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.219 
increase the resistance you can
gradually<00:02:04.619> increase<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.460> angle<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
gradually increase the angle and so the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
gradually increase the angle and so the
summers<00:02:07.590> power<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.340> strength<00:02:08.720> increases

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
summers power and strength increases

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.210 
summers power and strength increases
throughout<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> season<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> well

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
throughout the season we have a well

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
throughout the season we have a well
planned<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.880> program<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.720> numbers<00:02:13.380> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
planned out program of numbers of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
planned out program of numbers of
repetition<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.370> increase<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.510> resistance<00:02:16.110> as

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
repetition and increase of resistance as

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.100 
repetition and increase of resistance as
the<00:02:16.319> season<00:02:16.770> goes<00:02:16.920> on
