00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.759
 Some renault drivers will be where that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 problem surely have the key 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.570
 synonymous to unlock use but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 no longer to the states 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.210
 the point here is that there is one here 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.630
 sender and a transporter 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.910
 the transmitter is used around the car 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 to fill in transponder 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.669
 reader uses it with the thing 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.309
 key can identify 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.760
 you can handle the key relatively easily 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.320
 with a stanleymesser cut open 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.770
 not so deep into it so that the circuit board 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.899
 not injured 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 and then if you look at it so 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 Unfortunately, you can not quite get the case 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.829
 apart from that they also have one 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.629
 sticking a bit further if that is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 look now then you realize that this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 transponder track relatively often the problem 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 that's exactly this solder joint on here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:17.509
 I can measure that would be light 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:21.659
 It is exactly these days that is raising 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.280
 we then see exactly this 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.549
 solder joint as this is cold to -sold 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.920
 that means two keys already 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.950
 So we have this problem on bears 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.740
 but he does not start that is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.659
 pretty sure that and you can 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.490
 that does not quite include it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.200
 open 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:51.270
 it is enough if you are so with pistons 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 halfway there cleverly tried 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 to drive without too much plastic too 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.659
 merge 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.740
 I look through the home 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.570
 actually gets 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.409
 insist that this is easier 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.409
 revoke 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.480
 draufhalten 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.269
 even real man equal to the test 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.269
 I try to raise the spool again 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.220
 it is not when we are already determined yes 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.750
 Only then again and it came 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.480
 just with uhu plus or something 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.290
 to reproduce and the matter has changed 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
 Hoffmann not only new keys 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.819
 case if the key housing yet 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.880
 Calculate today what with my first 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.760
 key happened then you get 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.370
 with 23 euros the fibeg came open 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.110
 That's not the big deal 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.829
 otherwise new key almost between 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.140
 2 and 3 learn 100 euro with readers 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.140
 and so it pays off
