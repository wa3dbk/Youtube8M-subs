00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello and welcome to par 16 of myths 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.120
 and crepe and pasta without saying more 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.660
 let us begin 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.389
 who burn German character of the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.100
 saga al fly is one of the most important characters 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.130
 mysterious of the history of the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.570
 videogames nobody knows who it is that makes 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.330
 or why it is there 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.239
 in the end there are many theories about this 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.399
 strange character one of the most theories 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.980
 recurrent is that germÃ¡n be in 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.079
 gordon freeman reality of the future and that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.050
 has come to make him avoid something to his 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.510
 past many of the fans keep that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 theory from half life though theories 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.030
 less elaborate have been born a second 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.550
 German theory is that it is a 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.920
 alien mercenary entity so that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.960
 would fit kg manning and laser equal 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.179
 way out he would freeman 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.769
 using the most indicated for your 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.719
 task 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.300
 it seems that according to that theory his 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.550
 committed negotiated with the vortices the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.949
 only intelligent species of generates 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.070
 will destroy island the administrator of 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.770
 sen and thus get your freedom in return 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.110
 according to the theory German would receive the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.020
 total control over sen 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.510
 a third theory is that german is a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.120
 government agent what would explain his 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.190
 clothing and his appearances talking 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.250
 with video game staff like in the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.040
 first out live a fourth theory 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.410
 rather less affected is to take 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.990
 gordon freeman like a sickly crazy 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.970
 this idea is based on the white 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.580
 glow that always enters or 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.680
 Geman comes out whose figure has a halo 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 almost clinical clarity so 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.729
 we would say that everything played and everything 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.979
 happened is created by the mind 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.009
 disturbed of gordon and gem is not another 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.320
 thing that a doctor this theory is the one 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.600
 less foundations has since gordon 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.119
 Freeman shares the appearances of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.759
 henman with the character doctor he and vans 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.390
 how can we know during 'flight 2 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.820
 episode 2 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.120
 let's move on to the next fear that happened to me 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.130
 If you give me your world of warcraft the mystery 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.709
 of the children possessed 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.959
 in the house furthest away from the golden villa 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.050
 on the second floor there are six 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.790
 children in the form of a pentagon 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.160
 although these are silent and without 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.080
 move at the moment you go up 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.760
 the stairs the song of the game 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.760
 change as if it were terror 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.970
 after a few seconds the boys 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.640
 they say all of you will die and burn in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.620
 hell there are those who claim that they 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.560
 it's about a gloomy reference to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.450
 Friday the 13th the truth is that you can 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.510
 catch by surprise anyone who 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.099
 pass by in addition at 7 am of the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.159
 server time you can find them 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.099
 in storm forming a pentagram and 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.409
 After a while they return to the villa on 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.420
 next myth I pass locomotive exe 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.510
 kiel and according to what he told me this 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.870
 happened to him for that reason is counted in 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.970
 first person was a Sunday day like 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.519
 any other and like every Sunday 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.650
 I went to buy a game for a man 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.530
 my friend I saw the game of Tony Hawk 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.599
 projects or tony hawk project 8 when 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.180
 I saw it it gave me a chill I ignored it 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.700
 thinking that it was only because of the cold I arrived 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.230
 to my house and I played everything normal but 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.019
 after a few weeks 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.480
 unlock a character called pet 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.280
 beaver was a weird character the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.359
 information of the character was the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.560
 next height 174 meters old it seemed 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.040
 as of 14 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.500
 a little more suit because a beaver xd was 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.080
 funny a friend of mine used it a lot and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.690
 I also one day while loading the 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.430
 game on the screen appears mascot 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.370
 Beaver with her cleavage in her hand 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.980
 staring at you and it was not an image 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.350
 as beaver mascot was moving I thought that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.049
 it was a mistake the game gave me a bit of 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.480
 scared but good to keep playing but 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.880
 the more days in a row he played more 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.490
 bad luck he had hit me a lot and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.220
 I also fell a lot started to have 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.350
 bad luck in school had very bad 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.720
 luck with the girl that I liked me 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.210
 they forgot things very quickly 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.700
 It took a long time late and in the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.910
 oral lessons or exams I was going for 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.729

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.400
 buy another game and shit unemployment 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.190
 I stopped playing tony hawk project 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.740
 8 and everything disappeared everything started from
