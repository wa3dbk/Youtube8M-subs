okay<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.680> making<00:00:50.190> negative<00:00:50.489> association

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
okay this is making negative association

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
okay this is making negative association
and<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.600> dog's<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.960> stay<00:00:52.170> away<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
consequence and you also want to set up

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
consequence and you also want to set up
the<00:00:59.129> situation<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.420> dog<00:01:00.570> doesn't

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
teaching the dog to do something for me

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
teaching the dog to do something for me
I<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> apply<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> positive<00:01:06.630> consequence

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I want to apply a positive consequence

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 
I want to apply a positive consequence
the<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.070> time<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.310> use<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.490> negative

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the only time I use a negative

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
the only time I use a negative
consequence<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> training<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.680> negative

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
consequence in training and a negative

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
consequence in training and a negative
consequence<00:01:11.490> doesn't<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> be

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
consequence doesn't mean it has to be

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
consequence doesn't mean it has to be
something<00:01:13.170> harsh<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.950> could<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.220> something<00:01:14.580> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
something harsh it could be something as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170 
something harsh it could be something as
simple<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.220> putting<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> dog<00:01:17.790> in

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
simple as you know putting the dog in

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
simple as you know putting the dog in
the<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.810> room<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.380> few<00:01:19.530> minutes<00:01:19.650> or

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the other room for a few minutes or

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
the other room for a few minutes or
separating<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> dog<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> family<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
separating the dog from the family that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
separating the dog from the family that
could<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> negative<00:01:23.009> consequence<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
could be a negative consequence so a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
could be a negative consequence so a
negative<00:01:25.500> consequence<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.189> something<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
negative consequence is something that I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
negative consequence is something that I
use<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> dog<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.360> doing<00:01:27.659> something

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
use where the dog is doing something

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
use where the dog is doing something
that<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> dog<00:01:30.299> isn't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that I don't like so if the dog isn't

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
that I don't like so if the dog isn't
coming<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> call<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.310> not

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
coming to me when I call them it's not

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.039 
coming to me when I call them it's not
necessarily<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> doing<00:01:33.540> something<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.900> don't

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
necessarily to doing something I don't

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
necessarily to doing something I don't
like<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.470> probably<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.310> understand

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
like it's probably they don't understand

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730 
like it's probably they don't understand
the<00:01:35.970> command<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.259> sure<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the command so I want to make sure that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
the command so I want to make sure that
I<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.009> set<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> situation<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
I can set up the situation so I can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
I can set up the situation so I can
