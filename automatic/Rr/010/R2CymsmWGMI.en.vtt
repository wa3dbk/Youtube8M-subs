00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.700
 today in this new video I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.210
 will introduce you to the bus usb 3.0 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.710
 dina tech as usual on the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 package we find the product on the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.289
 front face 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.029
 on one side we find the name of 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.100
 the mark of the other there are the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 technical specifications of the product is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.869
 below is the content of the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.880
 box 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 when we open we find in a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.439
 first time the hub with seven usb ports 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 3.0 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.640
 then cables and a manual 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.460
 of instruction that's what the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 esb bus is quite long but very late on 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 the top we have seven help for us 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.340
 indicate if a product is plugged in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 or not you will be able to plug in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.700
 usb up to this device it's just 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 huge 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.500
 underneath there is the product name as well 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 that four antiskid and back one has 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.420
 a power button to turn on the hub 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 as well as two connectors the first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 to connect the device to an outlet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 current and the second to connect the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.769
 hub to your computer via usb cable 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 3.0 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 so we go we plug that on the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 outlet that have connect it to a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.570
 other computer press the button 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.430
 power and we can plug all our 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.140
 devices on the hop hop hop hop hub and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.369
 hop 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 good I plugged in that 5 but you 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.939
 see the principle we can really all 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.320
 plugged in as the hub has 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.689
 usb ports 3.0 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 it's really super fast and super 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.810
 useful because as you see on the screen 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.409
 you can really all connected 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 plug all your devices on 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.009
 today computers has 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.750
 less and less usb grip look at them 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.820
 macbook air or the new macbook 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.860
 they were really stripped of taken 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.570
 usb so thanks to this people you go 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.189
 able to counter that but you're going 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380
 able to counter this lack two usb ports 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.149
 by tons and tons of cables 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 and that's really the big point 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.020
 negative of this hub you see it more one 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.590
 appliance branch plus it's 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 attackable 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.119
 and it's really super disturbing if I 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.939
 had to summarize this video I find the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.070
 really awesome bar super useful and not 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.590
 too badly aesthetically too 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.440
 against he can use this cable there he 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.240
 must be plugged into the mains 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.960
 and then then there are the cables of 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.500
 your hard drive your iphone's 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.090
 your ipad of your connected world finally 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.740
 in short, it's a pile of threads 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.030
 really not beautiful and in the long run I 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.040
 think it's pretty painful 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.100
 good in fact it would have to remove all these 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.180
 cables and there the web would be perfect 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.850
 I could tell you about Seube 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 with seven USB 3.0 ports for your 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.220
 computer 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.050
 if it happens you are interested 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 well for you to get it will be in 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.390
 the description on this month I you 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.510
