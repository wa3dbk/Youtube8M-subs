00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Hi guys welcome back to my channel today I have a glamorous look  

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Super easy to achieve for those days that need elegance in minutes

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I apply the eye shadow base in light tone 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
With this fluffy brush that help me to distribute the product perfectly 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Next to highlight my brow bone I use this 2 eye shadows in light tones

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Mixing them on a flat brush first I pack it on the brow bone

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then blend it on the crease

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now take a burgundy tone to intensify the crease shape 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but only in the outer part of the lid 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This will  enlarge the dimension of the eye 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Next I apply this dark brown shade with same brush 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Directly in the crease right on the socket line 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In a generous amount to have the perfect dimension and transition color 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Then I use a matte black eye shadow to darken outer mobile eyelid

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
First in tap motions and then blend edges to get a gradient effect 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Get back to re-apply each shade that lose  intensity in the process

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now picking  these Gem Dust that seem sheets of glitter with a synthetic brush 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here I apply the one in Green Duo Chrome to get a background 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then with a moistened brush apply Golden ones on top 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Start in the inner corner and get on the middle of mobile eyelid 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
In tap motions you will see golden sheets
