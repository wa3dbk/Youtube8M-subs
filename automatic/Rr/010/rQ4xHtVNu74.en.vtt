00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello welcome to my channel the words 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.519
 of fine youtube I am fa and today we are going to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.750
 react to the insurgent trailer 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.730
 this trailer came out about a week ago 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
 but I almost never liked it in the first place 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 see the trailers 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
 that's how I do not and I wait to see 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.460
 if one day I see them in the cinema myself 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.340
 I have not seen it either, I 'm going to put it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 the same times although from here it says 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 that came out on November 12th we are 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 I 've only seen the new poster in 24 hours 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 which is that it's like a building like that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 on fire or whatever it is a teaser or 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.350
 is a trailer is a trailer 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.350
 of the trailer and well let's see it ready 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.340
 I like that when I buy it lionsgate 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.340
 they do not take it off summit 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 Listen 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.189
 the king of the ves 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.520
 it does not seem 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.520
 that does not seem 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.600
 you notice the budget change this is 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.420
 see as already action movie as well as 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.799
 fall is the change the budget is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.010
 note a lot 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:54.000
 I guess it does not 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.000
 because if 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.540
 yes it is me insurgent and this does not 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 is a spoiler because it is already 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 and is that if the cut that I was bringing is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 as here you do not cut it report it 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.670
 short that with one hand so I already 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.250
 you are my favorite parts of all the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.380
 story floor super awkward so I 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.850
 like how good the haircut ok 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.080
 women this is a phenomenon that is 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.610
 true women when we change 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.070
 the hair we change in the part of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.690
 we or say that the fringe mode 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.250
 if we want to feel different whether 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.230
 not then like that moment when 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.210
 three is cut the hair is how it is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.030
 another actress the insurgent actress and not 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.150
 divergent I got really excited I'm not 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.520
 sure if it's like a dream or not 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.460
 like everything is like the garden or how 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.410
 is that it's in what's it called 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.720
 I really liked the crows you saw them 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.850
 and the crows like that while they're 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.920
 surrounded and all the bodies touched me 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 A lot does a lot of action in composÃ© 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.040
 compared to the other trailers because 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.540
 here is like an established world the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 continuation to what is happening 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.560
 but I did not feel much shorter than what 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.560
 I hope to leave another you know no 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.890
 but it's very good can work 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.590
 even as a trailer for a movie 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.959
 you do not know what's happening but yes and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.959
 well I think that's all for this 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 content 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.480
 is that I have not told them but it is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.280
 about six years ago I bought my computer 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.030
 very happy that's why I was more often and 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.500
 that's why it fell less to export to everything 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.790
 it's very fast and it connected with my 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 phone and I took what I needed if the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 calls here is a technology that the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.190
 people that the fact that if I already knew 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.870
 I kind mind the emptiness like that of youzhny 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.130
 page also did not 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 I was already obsolete 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.330
 mine is ours we have to do it 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.800
 in the video that will be a collaboration 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.800
 tell me you want to see 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.790
 in those who review feel that I have as 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.830
 pending of what I say is that they know that 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.780
 I read that it's easier then faster to 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.180
 I do a teach to just reread them 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.150
 you already program it and everything you would like 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.950
 see I'm going to do one of mckinsey too 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 because I already had the movie 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.030
 It changes me but here we go we do it together 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.470
 we met you later but we did not do that 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.240
 there is a failure only if they let us hear 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.770
 but I need to read another fifth rhythm and 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.540
 it makes me that we have to do casting 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.820
 fire and the hunger games' I say and 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.560
 makeup because it's only on the channel 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.420
 the one with the game is not 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.270
 traditionally see us again I 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.480
 I answer that because we are going to govern 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.790
 McKinley and then put me on and 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.700
 I make the movie book already after 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.210
 casting fire or something casting fire and me 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.770
 I hope 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.290
 you said that I would prefer to be very 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.850
 unhappy taking advantage of exterminating and that 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.770
 I just saw it and then again 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.480
 a casting fire revealed that but tell me 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.820
 what do you think of good that 's all for 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.840
 this video you already know that you see me 7 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.110
 and 2 in the comments 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.110
 bye 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.910
 yes 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.490
 if in the background weird because everything in this 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.630
 fourth change if there is a reason not only 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.400
 you are really the fourth one is very 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.100
 different now and apart they just saw 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.390
 your knee and now I'm jumping on the 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.390
 I'm usually in a bank
