ever<00:04:23.360> made<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.690> turn<00:04:25.180> wow<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:26.480> is<00:04:26.540> just<00:04:26.930> so

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
ever made the turn wow this is just so

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.879 
ever made the turn wow this is just so
impressively<00:04:28.220> fast

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.969 

and<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> feels<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.939> easy<00:04:32.319> it<00:04:33.319> just<00:04:33.349> feels<00:04:33.740> as

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
and it feels so easy it just feels as

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.270 
and it feels so easy it just feels as
though<00:04:34.210> everything<00:04:35.210> about<00:04:35.509> it<00:04:35.810> is<00:04:36.009> on<00:04:37.009> this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
though everything about it is on this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.390 
though everything about it is on this
higher<00:04:38.150> frequency<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.050> performance

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.749 

but<00:04:44.000> obviously<00:04:44.300> it's<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.460> supernaturally<00:04:46.460> fast

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
but obviously it's a supernaturally fast

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.460 
but obviously it's a supernaturally fast
car<00:04:47.060> so<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:47.750> does<00:04:47.900> take<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:48.139> little<00:04:48.259> bit<00:04:48.380> of

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
car so it does take a little bit of

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.999 
car so it does take a little bit of
getting<00:04:48.620> used<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.750 

amazing

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
amazing

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.980
