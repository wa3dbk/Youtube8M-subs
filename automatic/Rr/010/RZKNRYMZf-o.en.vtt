00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
that's in front of him and then so he's

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.920 
that's in front of him and then so he's

and<00:00:27.140> then<00:00:27.740> run<00:00:28.040> fast<00:00:28.640> backward<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.600> stay<00:00:29.870> low

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
and then run fast backward and stay low

and then run fast backward and stay low
everything<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.650> do<00:00:30.830> low<00:00:31.100> is<00:00:31.370> to<00:00:31.490> make<00:00:31.640> sure

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
everything to do low is to make sure

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.029 
everything to do low is to make sure
that<00:00:31.970> we<00:00:32.090> can<00:00:32.210> change<00:00:32.450> position<00:00:33.050> fast<00:00:33.770> and

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
that we can change position fast and

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.350 
that we can change position fast and
quickly<00:00:34.250> when<00:00:34.760> they're<00:00:34.910> calling<00:00:35.120> the

quickly when they're calling the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.940 
quickly when they're calling the
receivers<00:00:35.809> they're<00:00:35.960> changing<00:00:36.410> routes<00:00:36.620> they

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
receivers they're changing routes they

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.860 
receivers they're changing routes they
change<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.310> direction<00:00:37.460> we<00:00:38.270> need<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.540> do<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.720> as

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
change the direction we need to do it as

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.810 
change the direction we need to do it as
fast<00:00:39.110> as<00:00:39.230> possible<00:00:39.320> that's<00:00:40.220> why<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:40.460> be<00:00:40.579> putting

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
fast as possible that's why I be putting

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.479 
fast as possible that's why I be putting
the<00:00:41.000> T<00:00:41.210> steps<00:00:41.510> most<00:00:42.500> important<00:00:42.890> RT<00:00:43.100> stuff<00:00:43.310> that

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
the T steps most important RT stuff that

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.850 
the T steps most important RT stuff that
they've<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.760> can<00:00:43.910> plant<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.420> foot<00:00:44.739> set<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
they've you can plant the foot set the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.470 
they've you can plant the foot set the
direction<00:00:46.280> we<00:00:46.340> want<00:00:46.400> to<00:00:46.520> go<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.850> explode<00:00:47.300> off

direction we want to go and explode off
that<00:00:47.660> foot<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:48.470> not<00:00:48.770> possible<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.340> plant

what<00:00:58.250> we're<00:00:58.340> going<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.490> see<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.910> how<00:00:59.030> he's

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
what we're going to see is the how he's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.000 
what we're going to see is the how he's
going<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.420> plant<00:00:59.720> his<00:00:59.840> foot<00:00:59.990> in<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.230> Chi<00:01:00.500> angle

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
going to plant his foot in the Chi angle

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.310 
going to plant his foot in the Chi angle
and<00:01:01.490> then<00:01:01.610> explore<00:01:01.940> 45<00:01:02.420> degrees<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.110> side

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
and then explore 45 degrees to this side

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.430 
and then explore 45 degrees to this side
go<00:01:06.430> tease<00:01:07.430> them<00:01:07.750> what<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.840> important<00:01:09.290> let<00:01:09.380> me

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
go tease them what is important let me

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.320 
go tease them what is important let me
see<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.740> making<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.220> cheese<00:01:10.460> steps<00:01:10.790> that<00:01:11.120> we

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
see it making the cheese steps that we

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.270 
see it making the cheese steps that we
breaking<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> speed<00:01:12.260> with<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.590> feet<00:01:12.830> behind

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
breaking the speed with the feet behind

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.870 
breaking the speed with the feet behind
in<00:01:13.790> an<00:01:14.180> angle<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:14.750> forms<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.229> Chi<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:16.640> whole

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
in an angle that forms the Chi the whole

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.460 
in an angle that forms the Chi the whole
momentum<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.450> going<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.110> way

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
momentum is going that way

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.500 
momentum is going that way
and<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.860> catch<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.280> within<00:01:19.400> one<00:01:19.580> foot<00:01:19.880> so

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
and you catch that within one foot so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.850 
and you catch that within one foot so
what<00:01:20.690> we're<00:01:20.810> doing<00:01:20.840> now<00:01:21.050> we've<00:01:21.350> breaking<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
what we're doing now we've breaking the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.700 
what we're doing now we've breaking the
speed<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.729> lifting<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.270> foot<00:01:23.710> planning

direction we want to go and then they

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.080 
direction we want to go and then they
explore<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.140> foot<00:01:27.410> forward<00:01:27.970> now<00:01:28.970> I'm
