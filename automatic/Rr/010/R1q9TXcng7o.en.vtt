00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
but anything that happens outside of the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.130 
but anything that happens outside of the
horse<00:03:20.870> city<00:03:21.170> sounds<00:03:21.590> that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
horse city sounds that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.230

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.770 

we<00:03:30.240> respond<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> horse

I<00:03:31.810> think<00:03:32.140> all<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.380> those<00:03:32.650> small<00:03:33.070> reactions<00:03:33.820> are

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
I think all of those small reactions are

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.350 
I think all of those small reactions are
what<00:03:34.450> really<00:03:35.400> let<00:03:36.400> other<00:03:36.610> people<00:03:37.000> believe

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
what really let other people believe

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:52.440 
what really let other people believe
that<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.230> living<00:03:38.500> thing

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.750 

it's<00:03:53.140> terribly<00:03:53.590> satisfying<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.550> know<00:03:54.580> that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
it's terribly satisfying to know that

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
that there is still a willingness to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640 
that there is still a willingness to
engage<00:03:57.420> by<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.480> audience<00:03:58.990> there's<00:03:59.530> a
