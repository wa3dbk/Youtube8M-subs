00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.340 
surprise a few of you is that I saw him
a<00:03:26.820> few<00:03:26.850> times<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.540> USA<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.960> a<00:03:28.020> pre-season

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
a few times in the USA in a pre-season

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.530 
a few times in the USA in a pre-season
tour<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.920> I've<00:03:29.490> said<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.670> before<00:03:29.760> he<00:03:30.390> was

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
tour and I've said it before he was

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.300 
tour and I've said it before he was
pretty<00:03:31.350> much<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> best<00:03:31.770> player<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.160> pitch

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
pretty much the best player on the pitch

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.700 
pretty much the best player on the pitch
in<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.970> those<00:03:33.060> games<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:34.260> Swansea

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
in all of those games I think Swansea

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.340 
in all of those games I think Swansea
the<00:03:35.040> ideal<00:03:35.430> opponent<00:03:36.030> for<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.660> player<00:03:37.170> like

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the ideal opponent for a player like

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.500 
the ideal opponent for a player like
Moses<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.980> come<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.060> stake<00:03:39.360> his

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
Moses to come in and you know stake his

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720 
Moses to come in and you know stake his
claim<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.860> if<00:03:41.070> he<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.370> bang<00:03:41.610> on

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
claim really and see if he can bang on

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.450 
claim really and see if he can bang on
the<00:03:41.820> door<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.720> first<00:03:42.900> 11<00:03:43.260> full-time<00:03:43.980> so

we're<00:04:12.600> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.900> Falcao<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.620> Remy<00:04:14.370> on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.360 
we're going to have Falcao and Remy on
the<00:04:14.820> bench<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.190> looks

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
the bench and I think that that looks

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.140 
the bench and I think that that looks
like<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.760> pretty<00:04:18.030> strong<00:04:18.480> team<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:21.060> do

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
like a pretty strong team but what do

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.920 
like a pretty strong team but what do
you<00:04:21.210> think<00:04:21.299> as<00:04:22.169> ever<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.280> comments<00:04:23.640> below

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.290 
you think as ever in the comments below
we<00:04:24.930> want<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.290> know<00:04:25.470> what<00:04:25.800> your<00:04:26.100> start<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:26.550> 11

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
we want to know what your start in 11

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.020 
we want to know what your start in 11

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
on new champions this season in my

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
on new champions this season in my
opinion<00:04:59.220> could<00:04:59.639> be<00:04:59.789> one<00:04:59.909> of<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.060> most

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
opinion could be one of the most

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.240 
opinion could be one of the most
exciting<00:05:00.449> ever<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.020> think<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.289> four<00:05:01.530> teams<00:05:01.800> are

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
exciting ever I think the four teams are

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.980 
exciting ever I think the four teams are
all<00:05:02.699> within<00:05:02.940> with<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> really<00:05:03.659> good<00:05:03.750> shot<00:05:03.960> of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
all within with a really good shot of

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.470 
all within with a really good shot of
winning<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.319> league
