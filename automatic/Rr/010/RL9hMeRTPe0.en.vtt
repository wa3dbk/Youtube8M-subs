00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
surprised he's gotta weigh in on the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.250 
surprised he's gotta weigh in on the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
issue and kind of stir things up

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.190 
issue and kind of stir things up
although<00:02:22.260> he<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:24.660> has<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> lot<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
although he you know has a lot of

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.940 
although he you know has a lot of
support<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.210> hunting

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
support in this you know the hunting

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
support in this you know the hunting
there's<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.040> lot<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> people<00:02:29.490> who<00:02:29.730> love<00:02:29.940> hunting

and<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.960> rationale<00:02:31.530> which<00:02:31.740> is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and that is the rationale which is

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.290 
and that is the rationale which is
they're<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.550> starve<00:02:32.820> anyway

they're going to starve anyway

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630 
they're going to starve anyway
especially<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.620> give<00:02:34.950> them<00:02:34.980> nowhere<00:02:35.340> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
especially if you give them nowhere to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.750 
especially if you give them nowhere to
live<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.590> minute<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.700> know

from doing so well said raj that is that

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.900 
from doing so well said raj that is that
surely<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.040> rational<00:03:02.790> response

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the correct way to carry out the sport

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.030 
the correct way to carry out the sport
as<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:35.820> call<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.360> hunting<00:03:36.890> but<00:03:37.890> then

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
that this sounds like this was just a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.650 
that this sounds like this was just a
