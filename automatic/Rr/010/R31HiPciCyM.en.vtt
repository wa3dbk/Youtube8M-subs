00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
way to do this is to create a custom

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
way to do this is to create a custom
report<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:17.449> already<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.840> some<00:00:19.140> pre-made

to my website despite dramatically I'm

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.850 
to my website despite dramatically I'm
going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> explain<00:00:53.250> why<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> tells<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
going to explain why and it tells you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
going to explain why and it tells you
the<00:00:56.129> time<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.210> people<00:00:57.390> spend<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> side

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the time that people spend on the side

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
the time that people spend on the side
and<00:00:58.879> time<00:00:59.879> per<00:01:00.149> page<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.870> doesn't<00:01:01.050> make

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and time per page really doesn't make

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.369 
and time per page really doesn't make
sense<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> drill<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
sense now but if you drill down and you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.969 
sense now but if you drill down and you
