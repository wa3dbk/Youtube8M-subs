00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.069
 the goji berries this time we are in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.340
 Deep Asian room where the goji 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.450
 Berries already for billions of years 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 traditionally used and also 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.030
 still received today 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 in the daily diet, above all 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 in china in mongolia but also to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.640
 down to tibet 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 i know tibet china will be this 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 planted and by the inhabitants 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 used especially in the Tibetan area 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 we find here the best quality of it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 does it really make any difference from 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 taste really good 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.570
 It is also like that is one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 mixture of her gummy bears and 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.690
 bird food taste really good and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 contains a true nutrient bomb 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.300
 that's how we have, for example 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.030
 more iron than in spinach 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.480
 We have a whole lot of vital substances 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 essential fatty acids many amino acids 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 possible all essential amino acids 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 a whole lot of antioxidants like 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.799
 getting a whole lot of vitamin a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.650
 beta carotene and very interesting before 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.080
 here we have the trace element 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 germanium in it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 which is hardly in these days 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.439
 foods are mainly to be found 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.619
 by the kind of cultivation we now times 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.840
 with food today 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.390
 it simply extinct here you will find 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.579
 she still looks that from biological 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.860
 cultivation is possible and possibly out 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.630
 the south chinese tibetan room 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 There you have the best quality with it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 some of these antioxidants work 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 especially good on the nervous system 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.689
 and are very good for getting the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.680
 eyes strength and for prevention against 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.909
 diseases associated with it 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.590
 It is also very good for detoxification 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 good for the immune system 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.780
 It is good for a good intestinal flora 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.390
 stress and even helps to build muscle 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.719
 and do not eat now anyway 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.129
 So I can only recommend one 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.770
 secret tip under the train already on 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.490
 to look at the very top and from the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 taste just good 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.270
 it would have to be with the muslims or is 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.530
 Just as a fingerfood as a snack 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.810
 take with you to the cinema instead of anything 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.810
 other tastes really good
