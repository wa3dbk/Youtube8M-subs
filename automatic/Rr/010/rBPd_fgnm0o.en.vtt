00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.820 

well<00:00:04.589> I've<00:00:04.680> got<00:00:05.930> all<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.200> all<00:00:07.319> felt<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
well I've got all in all felt like a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.990 
well I've got all in all felt like a
first<00:00:08.130> football<00:00:08.340> game<00:00:08.599> felt<00:00:09.599> like<00:00:10.759> we<00:00:11.759> played

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
first football game felt like we played

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.039 
first football game felt like we played
hard<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.509> thought<00:00:12.750> both<00:00:12.990> teams<00:00:13.259> played<00:00:13.440> hard<00:00:13.670> I

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
hard I thought both teams played hard I

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.450 
hard I thought both teams played hard I
thought<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.529> areas<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.039> were<00:00:17.130> sloppy

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
thought in a lot of areas we were sloppy

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.140 
thought in a lot of areas we were sloppy
obviously<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> special<00:00:18.720> teams<00:00:19.760> rough<00:00:20.760> upon<00:00:21.060> her

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
obviously a special teams rough upon her

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.040 
obviously a special teams rough upon her
and<00:00:21.449> snap<00:00:21.750> upon<00:00:22.080> over<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.410> head<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.779> drop<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and snap upon over your head you drop a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
and snap upon over your head you drop a
kickoff<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:25.980> yard<00:00:26.189> line<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:27.090> muff

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
kickoff on the one yard line you muff

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.019 
kickoff on the one yard line you muff
another<00:00:27.630> kick<00:00:27.900> off<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> seven<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.460> in

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
another kick off on the seven and in

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.020 
another kick off on the seven and in
turn<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> BYU<00:00:32.730> did<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
turn I think with all of that BYU did a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
turn I think with all of that BYU did a
good<00:00:33.239> job<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.480> managing<00:00:33.750> field<00:00:34.260> position<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
good job of managing field position and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
good job of managing field position and
I<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.700> was<00:00:35.820> something<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.480> were

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I know that was something that they were

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
I know that was something that they were
focused<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.559> coming<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> game<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
focused on coming into the game and it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.290 
focused on coming into the game and it
really<00:00:39.270> paid<00:00:39.480> dividends<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.640> if<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:42.239> were

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really paid dividends for if we were

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
really paid dividends for if we were
playing<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.780> long<00:00:42.989> field<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.500> were

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
playing with long field they were

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
playing with long field they were
playing<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> shorter<00:00:44.340> field<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.570> when

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
playing with a shorter field and when

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.139 
playing with a shorter field and when
that<00:00:45.960> happens<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> feel<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.969> when

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that happens I think you feel like when

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
that happens I think you feel like when
you're<00:00:48.300> marching<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.170> marching<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you're marching and you're marching and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
you're marching and you're marching and
you're<00:00:49.890> marching<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.120> into

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you're marching you can get into

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
you're marching you can get into
situations<00:00:51.539> where<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> feel<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.649> man<00:00:52.920> we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
situations where you feel like man we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
situations where you feel like man we
got<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> make<00:00:53.489> maximize<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.270> opportunities

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
got to make maximize your opportunities

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720 
got to make maximize your opportunities
because<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.190> many<00:00:56.579> are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because you don't know how many are

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.010 
because you don't know how many are
going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> work<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
going to get when you got to work that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.160 
going to get when you got to work that
hard<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> ball<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.160> field<00:01:00.170> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
hard to get the ball down the field and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.799 
hard to get the ball down the field and
that<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> reason<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> first<00:01:02.910> fourth

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that was the reason for the first fourth

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
that was the reason for the first fourth
down<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.049> tap<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.650> early<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> fourth

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
down and tap there early in the fourth

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
down and tap there early in the fourth
quarter<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.060> kind<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.170> early<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> fourth

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
quarter of kind of early in the fourth

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
quarter of kind of early in the fourth
quarter<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.280> did<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.600> forced<00:01:09.990> us

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
quarter that we did make and forced us

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
quarter that we did make and forced us
into<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.409> situation<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> had<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> go

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
into a situation where we had to go

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
into a situation where we had to go
forward<00:01:12.060> again<00:01:12.150> late<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> game<00:01:12.920> where<00:01:13.920> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
forward again late in the game where we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.320 
forward again late in the game where we
could<00:01:14.310> potentially<00:01:14.430> been<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> situation

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
could potentially been in a situation

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.730 
could potentially been in a situation
for<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> tiny<00:01:16.049> field<00:01:16.320> goal<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:18.409> know<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
for a tiny field goal so I know this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
for a tiny field goal so I know this
this<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.189> game<00:01:20.369> won't<00:01:20.640> define<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.240> season

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
this one game won't define our season

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.499 
this one game won't define our season
we've<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.110> 12<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.560> football<00:01:22.799> games<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> play

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
we've got 12 more football games to play

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
we've got 12 more football games to play
I<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:25.290> proud<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:25.770> effort<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.240> are

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
I was proud of our effort but there are

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
I was proud of our effort but there are
things<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.229> us<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> improve<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.130> will

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
things all of us can improve on and will

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.780 
things all of us can improve on and will
continue<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> try<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.000> prove<00:01:30.270> fun<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.610> kind

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
continue to try to prove fun it was kind

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
continue to try to prove fun it was kind
of<00:01:32.880> philosophy<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> last<00:01:33.810> job<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of philosophy on that last job you just

of philosophy on that last job you just
trying<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> last<00:01:35.009> shot<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:36.450> just

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
trying to get the last shot I was just

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
trying to get the last shot I was just
trying<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> run<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> best<00:01:37.500> place<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.979> could

trying to run the best place we could

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.969 
trying to run the best place we could
run<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.579> Iowa<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.479> wasn't<00:01:40.079> concerned<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.799> much

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
run in Iowa I wasn't concerned as much

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.950 
run in Iowa I wasn't concerned as much
about<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> last<00:01:41.610> possession<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.930> I

about the last possession as I was I
just<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.530> sure<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.860> weren't<00:01:44.040> in

with<00:02:36.310> Leo<00:02:37.000> definitely<00:02:37.690> we're<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.990> use<00:02:38.140> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
with Leo definitely we're going to use a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.070 
with Leo definitely we're going to use a
lot<00:02:38.350> Jake<00:02:38.650> more<00:02:38.950> than<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.220> had<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.900> thought

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
lot Jake more than we had and I thought

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.160 
lot Jake more than we had and I thought
we<00:02:41.230> were<00:02:41.290> able<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.500> do<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.910> then<00:02:43.570> once<00:02:43.960> we

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
we were able to do that and then once we

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.720 
we were able to do that and then once we
really<00:02:44.440> came<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:44.980> were<00:02:45.010> assessing<00:02:45.610> what

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
really came in we were assessing what

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
was happening we were in two backs they

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.140 
was happening we were in two backs they
were<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.650> there<00:02:48.310> with<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:48.550> physical<00:02:48.730> force

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and they were knocking us around so we

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.950 
and they were knocking us around so we
went<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.830> more<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.190> spread<00:02:51.520> attempt<00:02:51.960> spread

from home how to avoid those mistakes I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.970 
from home how to avoid those mistakes I
think<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.300> part<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.890> know

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
numerous reasons second half we don't

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.550 
numerous reasons second half we don't
score<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.110> point<00:03:56.320> you're<00:03:56.980> not<00:03:57.100> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.340> win

what if what are some of those reasons

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.910 
what if what are some of those reasons
in<00:04:00.580> your<00:04:00.670> estimation<00:04:00.790> well<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:02.050> think<00:04:02.290> again

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
in your estimation well I think again

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.770 
in your estimation well I think again
the<00:04:03.100> field<00:04:03.310> position<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:03.910> factor<00:04:04.360> right<00:04:04.630> off

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
the field position is a factor right off

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.810 
the field position is a factor right off
the<00:04:04.810> bat<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.769> where<00:04:06.010> we<00:04:06.100> get<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.280> ball<00:04:06.550> I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
the bat you where we get the ball I

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.440 
the bat you where we get the ball I
think<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.840> our<00:04:08.739> ability<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.310> create<00:04:09.880> turnovers

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
think to our ability to create turnovers

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.030 
think to our ability to create turnovers
or<00:04:10.630> lack<00:04:10.900> thereof<00:04:11.320> as

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
or lack thereof as

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.500 
or lack thereof as
actor<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.579> know<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.879> we're<00:04:13.209> I'll<00:04:13.329> be<00:04:13.450> able

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
actor you know that we're I'll be able

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.089 
actor you know that we're I'll be able
to<00:04:13.629> change<00:04:14.110> some<00:04:14.379> of<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:14.500> momentum<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
to change some of the momentum of the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.529 
to change some of the momentum of the
game<00:04:15.129> changed<00:04:15.700> some<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:15.969> field<00:04:16.150> position

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
game changed some of the field position

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.569 
game changed some of the field position
of<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.750> game<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:17.889> thirdly<00:04:18.130> when<00:04:18.400> we're

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
of the game and then thirdly when we're

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.759 
of the game and then thirdly when we're
crossing<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.090> 52<00:04:20.049> not<00:04:20.199> score<00:04:20.500> we're<00:04:20.650> not

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
crossing the 52 not score we're not

that can kill you and I don't know how I

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.400 
that can kill you and I don't know how I
think<00:04:25.120> in<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.300> fourth<00:04:25.509> quarter<00:04:25.750> three<00:04:26.169> times

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
think in the fourth quarter three times

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.200 
think in the fourth quarter three times
we're<00:04:26.680> on<00:04:26.770> their<00:04:26.919> side<00:04:26.979> field<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.699> came<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.030> no

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
we're on their side field it came out no

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.900 
we're on their side field it came out no
points<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.130> ultimately<00:04:30.130> that's<00:04:30.280> on<00:04:30.520> me<00:04:30.639> we've

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
points and ultimately that's on me we've

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.479 
points and ultimately that's on me we've
got<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.090> do<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> better<00:04:31.240> job
