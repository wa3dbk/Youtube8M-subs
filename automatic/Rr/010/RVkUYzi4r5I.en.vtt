where I need to be aggressive so

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.660 
where I need to be aggressive so
actually<00:00:19.170> today<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> pretty<00:00:20.220> good<00:00:20.520> match

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
actually today was a pretty good match

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
actually today was a pretty good match
and<00:00:22.160> it<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.490> step<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.380> step

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and it is one step I think it's one step

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.089 
and it is one step I think it's one step
only<00:00:25.949> two<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.430> reach<00:00:27.150> my<00:00:27.359> bed<00:00:27.510> game<00:00:27.800> like<00:00:28.800> what

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
do you think maybe the next step is zero

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.490 
do you think maybe the next step is zero

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
winner I just think I can serve a little

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
winner I just think I can serve a little
bit<00:00:37.230> better<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.910> um<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:40.430> mean<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> end

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
bit better and so um I mean in the end

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
bit better and so um I mean in the end
of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> second<00:00:42.450> set<00:00:42.629> i<00:00:42.660> start<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> block<00:00:43.559> too

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of the second set i start to block too

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
of the second set i start to block too
many<00:00:43.950> rich<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.610> i<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.760> i<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> maybe

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
many rich one so i think i can maybe

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.369 
many rich one so i think i can maybe
written<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.730> maybe<00:00:48.480> try<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> go

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
written much better and maybe try to go

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.840 
written much better and maybe try to go
a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.219> more<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.610> net<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.260> then
