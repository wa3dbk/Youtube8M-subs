00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone knows the waters then 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.629
 today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.179
 little tutorial that's super simple it's 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 take a screenshot on windows 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 vista so I'll show you then we 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:21.449
 go to the ponds and then we go to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 search and we tape on who captures so 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 that's where we do new then we 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 sees on the little arrow that on board and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.000
 have then are four forms of capture 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 to capture in free form 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 capture a rectangular format 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 capturing windows and capturing full 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.579
 screen so we will start with the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 capture a free format which is not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.230
 badly I do not find what can a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 little shape on a little pretty that a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.649
 star 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.820
 here I am going to show you I will do 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.180
 a heart-shaped catch so that's it 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 good he not super good but good 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.130
 after I do files for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 save it saved files under 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 office and there I put the name hides a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:22.770
 actual catch 0.1 recorded so there 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 we will spend the cloak load in dying 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.920
 and angry I am new genre 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 comes as just now I'm doing my 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.150
 small rectangular catch arrow he has 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 I take the cursor and slide it 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.320
 it's super easy 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:44.000
 the gema captures everything is good files 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.000
 recorded under capture number 2 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.160
 sorry if I speak like that because in 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.120
 did I have any plugs 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.190
 so here is now done again 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.550
 come back komm just now the little 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.710
 arrow 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.640
 so there are four hours left bankruptcy and 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.430
 full screen sensor 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.040
 so it's exactly the same and 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 catch so I'm going to do the catch 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.150
 in full screen 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.920
 I click on it it shows me 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.920
 the full screen I do files 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.140
 saved under but before that I'm going 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.210
 to show you how to draw with a 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.700
 stylus so it's super simple there is a 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.970
 small stylus seen and pat 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.320
 little little arrow and there is 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030
 several kinds of styles and so is 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.370
 style and red style plus style 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.720
 and black is it and personalized so 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:40.420
 We to make style and customized that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:43.680
 so here we customize then as 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 color then I'm going to put purple 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.940
 have invested the spikes wide a style 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.370
 and a point 2a or ok so here I can 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.360
 do a little what I want I try 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.840
 here we see here I am saying a little 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.230
 symmetry that is totally missed I 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.730
 I do not know very well in art so after 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.420
 if we see that we were wrong there 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.670
 no problem we see in go then 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.549
 good after if I resume my styles and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.830
 blue tip fine i'm going to resell in 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.910
 style and I think it's blue and the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.950
 after this if we want to pat highlighting 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.480
 on wax ignore it haunting restyled 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.270
 and between the album then we highlight it so 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.730
 here we go I'm going to do a polar h 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.660
 so here I am doing saved files 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.000
 under capture number 3 I'm going to call it 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.920
 like that you do not have to 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.800
 call them the same as you 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.440
 all is the lime that you are there but 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.360
 three catches are in the office so 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.690
 the number one catch that was shaped 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.000
 free the little choir years gone the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.430
 capture number two the rectangle very 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.550
 accurate and capture number 3 the full 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.550
 screen 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.120
