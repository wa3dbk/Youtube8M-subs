00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
possible and therefore I think nugget

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.200 
possible and therefore I think nugget
out<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.200> first<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.740> magical<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> second

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
out the first and magical the second

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:06.760 
out the first and magical the second
should<00:01:55.799> unite
