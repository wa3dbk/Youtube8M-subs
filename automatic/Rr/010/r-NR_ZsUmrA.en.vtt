00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.350
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.619
 the channel today wanted to show you what you 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.410
 buy find 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.869
 bosch without vacuum cleaner 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.900
 if you are interested in the topic then continue 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.900
 watch 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:34.330
 vacuum cleaner came here in this box 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 packed conveniently enough in it 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:45.190
 there is a vacuum cleaner charger 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.120
 How does the vacuum cleaner look like ? 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.900
 assembled 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:01:00.070
 I'll show you now separately like this 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:02.620
 looks like a vacuum cleaner assembled 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.899
 I did not tear off the label I decided to try 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:12.759
 vacuum cleaner action as i like it and 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:16.840
 if you don't like it, pass it back to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:22.060
 the shop basically the vacuum cleaner works 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.800
 not bad but when working while he's new from 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.119
 he smells very unpleasant 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.490
 chemistry 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.160
 which possibly goes with time 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.979
 i really don't like working 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.200
 with a vacuum cleaner in a well-ventilated 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.170
 indoors because this smell is very 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.119
 strong this is the first thing i dont 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.270
 I liked the second one that vacuum cleaner 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.860
 you make me very hard though 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.780
 a box of 3 kilograms on my scales he 3 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.770
 kilograms 400 grams I do not know how much 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.259
 no more precisely I would give it to the touch 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 all five kilograms are so heavy 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.970
 and uncomfortable personal for me this one here 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.410
 head that cleans 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.080
 parquet or carpet she dangles so much 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.660
 when you lift it and move it 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.319
 I also don't like it very much 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.770
 I don't know if I can continue to work with him 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.099
 or 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.400
 I did put it in the shop work 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.330
 vacuum cleaner I tried with me even there 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 filter there is some garbage which 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.280
 formed after his work and 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 I wanted to tell you that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.420
 this vacuum cleaner has three degrees of speed 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.370
 1 2 3 the most powerful is the third further what 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.950
 It should be noted that when the vacuum cleaner is charged 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:03.970
 then his indicator lights are on here 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.970
 i turn on now i'm speed 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.940
 Well 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.300
 to the bulb 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.550
 indications 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.850
 light bulb 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.850
 cut 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.750
 light bulb that says that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.090
 our vacuum cleaner can works 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 because it is illegal completely and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.560
 the second light is 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.510
 battery charge here you see 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.310
 that burn 2 of 3 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.010
 This means that she is not. 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.819
 it seems then you need to put it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.819
 charge 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.910
 farther 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.540
 well speed 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.310
 morning 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.500
 that's how this vacuum cleaner works for me 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.950
 I would like to know your opinion about 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.100
