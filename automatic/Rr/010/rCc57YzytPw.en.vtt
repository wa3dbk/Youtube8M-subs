00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.190
 good guys I wanted to teach you a topic 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.069
 that we have learned a lot that fuck me 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.610
 your day when when you install the ps4 and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.440
 others do not pay attention and I'm 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.070
 flipping is that this is the theme of the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.230
 connection rose garden of communication with 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 vita that I'm doing it now and it's 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.980
 an incredible thing not to notice I'm with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.509
 more is black flag register fijaros 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 established the remote control and no longer 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.829
 is explaining here how is the control 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.440
 for good to do it at a hundred 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.270
 hundred cash well know more or less what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.490
 things to seniors would have to do in the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 touch panel touch open maps and you to 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.900
 bookmark but good to see the screen 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 de vita shows it as it is 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.190
 screen as they appear in the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 TV on the screen on the screen 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.220
 to give you here to continue 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 a little bit and sometimes we're going to start 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 let's give me here I've lowered the volume 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 from the TV so that it does not bother us 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.180
 well points 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.399
 by the adri product and how 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.649
 shows the communication interview and ps4 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.370
 more specifically with this game because 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.580
 It seems that it is one of the best 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.580
 and for me it's going to be 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.000
 base what we foresee to this video are you going to 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 see is going to be for me the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.930
 send touchdown 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 with the first prize 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 yes 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 I do not know why I had not registered yet 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 a display in bs 4 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.350
 let's see here to continue a player 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 remember this is vital 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.340
 and normal TV here has already started the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.230
 game and we're going to eat any 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.319
 sequence of kinematics and nothing for the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.319
 style 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.420
 and well it happens that the problem of this goes 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.420
 to be like cojones I'm going to move 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 well, it does not matter if it's shown 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.709
 we have 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.240
 is that it looks very good and very well very 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.460
 well if I had the inconvenience of if 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.530
 the font of the letters was going to be 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.530
 very small and such and such a thing that the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.860
 menu occurs but in this game it seems 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.860
 that not so much 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 good 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.120
 fixed 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.340
 normal 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 we have started 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.390
 and in my drawer 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.300
 the skin of a quality pen that's 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.740
 true 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.690
 but we go 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.770
 It is very similar the appearance that the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.590
 father you notice that loss of quality the 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.160
 data transmission 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.080
 we paste the result is acojonante 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.270
 because apart here clear here the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.180
 communication between vita ips 4 is total or 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.820
 be you activate it and you see the ps menu 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.710
 4 invites is not like having the 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.800
 present screen or on this laptop 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.780
 light is not like the best in google there 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.760
 a communication on the screen of the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.230
 command shows one thing and that of the tele 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.690
 shows another different and also in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.690
 games that do not have the option of warm 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.659
 yes no 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.659
 essentially 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.190
 also playing on the big TV because 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.950
 in addition to the graphics that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.139
 post already 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.530
 it's like the pc version practically 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.530
 real 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.590
 a detail with me because it's typical of 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.900
 I'm tired not then if being 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.210
 sitting and I want to lie down and look then 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.139
 look, they charge your eyes and you put on 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.139
 Service at the hearing 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.470
 this is the game my position and complete 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.889
 the system is very well tied because 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.449
 his fixes lay on top of him 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.580
 what it would be with the touch to 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.580
 tell you what you have to press what 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.420
 who are bbva like that because in a group 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.420
 do the other thing was in water plugs 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.960
 I just did not want to show the 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.590
 movements that you can play in 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.590
 terms 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.240
 a triumph to leave the place 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.710
 Well guys was just this either and you 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.990
 I say again in to play here where not 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.850
 may l 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.080
 but that's where the subject freaks me out 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.120
 extra 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.169
 so thank you very much for being 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.169
 there we see every god
