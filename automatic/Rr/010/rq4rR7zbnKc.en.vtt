00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 

I<00:00:22.410> walk<00:00:23.160> by

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I walk by

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
I walk by
and<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> half<00:00:25.440> years<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.700> then<00:00:26.940> last

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and a half years and then last

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.730 
and a half years and then last
I<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.660> gonna<00:00:27.750> fire<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.619> it's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I was gonna fire it up to see if it's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.529 
I was gonna fire it up to see if it's
Corinne<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.490> wouldn't<00:00:29.759> start<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
Corinne and it wouldn't start all the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.400 
Corinne and it wouldn't start all the
battery's<00:00:30.990> dead

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
battery's dead

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.619 
battery's dead
so<00:00:31.770> it<00:00:31.919> jump-started<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:32.970> started<00:00:33.420> but

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
so it jump-started it and it started but

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:48.210 
so it jump-started it and it started but
the<00:00:33.750> blade<00:00:34.020> would<00:00:34.260> engage

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.240 

the<00:00:48.970> battery's<00:00:49.390> dead

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 

so<00:00:56.699> essentially<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.780> said<00:00:58.109> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
so essentially this thing said with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.030 
so essentially this thing said with
three<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> half<00:00:59.100> here

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
three and a half here

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.420 
three and a half here
starting<00:01:00.790> though<00:01:00.970> he<00:01:01.240> doing<00:01:01.540> any

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
starting though he doing any

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.060 
starting though he doing any
and<00:01:02.910> once<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.360> got

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
and once it got

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.230 
and once it got
we<00:01:04.159> get<00:01:04.400> fired<00:01:04.730> right<00:01:04.850> up<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.449> now<00:01:05.750> I'm<00:01:05.960> going
