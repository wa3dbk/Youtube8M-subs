00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.999
 on the third of April, state the movie park in bottrop-kirchhellen in the new 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.759
 Season before so again whole busloads with visitors approaching it 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.900
 Still, everything has died out like this calm before the storm she celebrates today 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.049
 Used to perform more than 50 exercises 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.880
 Forces have rehearsed what to do when in a restaurant 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 For example, a fryer explodes and fires 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.289
 Hustle and bustle when first used it has a kitchen fire in the restaurant of the 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.500
 Filmmuseum given 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 At least two people are missing and injured 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.480
 Villareal and both eyes apply to Warhammer Online for more decisive 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.340
 the first team finds the first missing in the review fairly quickly 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.020
 he is injured by the explosion of the deep fryer and lies unconscious on the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.130
 ground 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.340
 hampered by further explosions 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.600
 especially the two firefighters you just carry out 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.830
 as one of the saviors 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.480
 Suddenly passed out 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.010
 Of course that is just a show, but he kept the requirements for the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.090
 all exercise 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.650
 here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.050
 Herten 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.460
 The Londoners are two points on the site of the murders of three injured persons since that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 Building still a rescue team is ready why 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.390
 the conditions for the firefighters fought hard as in 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 the reality 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.320
 again and again explosions 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.610
 everything is full of smoke 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 They have to orient themselves in foreign roles and all under time pressure 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 In addition, today three volunteer fire brigade groups have to work together 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.780
 otherwise you do not have to pay attention to so many things at the same time 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 you actually 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.200
 Do not think about great thoughts at the age of 8 and 9 percent 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.689
 But that will not automatically stop customers should always return to 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.050
 Life 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.230
 usually reports are between emergency call and arrival of the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.259
 Rescuers do not pass more than seven minutes 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.570
 this is attributable to unconscious St 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 almost no chance to survive 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 January could 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.560
 they have to be on the market 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.409
 we will bring 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.819
 there came into the skid 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.540
 a solo effort 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.499
 been rescued 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:09.769
 after the rescue exercise 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.189
 The restaurant in the Movie Park is vented again 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.409
 also the health of firefighters with at rescue missions constantly 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.749
 Everybody watches an oxygen bottle on the back and watches 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.489
 their contents last for a maximum of 20 minutes 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.010
 a colleague controls how is the task forces going and exchanges 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.239
 then if necessary, the firefighters 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.239
 what would you personally take part in the exercise? 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.219
 how well we are doing for a debriefing and nubuck or 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.969
 Potential for improvement children for example 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.979
 in the print area 9 o'clock 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.529
 but otherwise I am quite satisfied 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.770
 It took a good hour over months 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.550
 which are not of this magnitude first-class in two years
