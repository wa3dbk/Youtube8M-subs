any place they can go in on several
places<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.640> Dacor<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:56.180> when<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.949> turn

places on this Dacor but when you turn

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
places on this Dacor but when you turn
on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.539> sparker<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.320> indeed<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
on the sparker you know indeed the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.090 
on the sparker you know indeed the
sparker<00:01:04.739> hits<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> brass<00:01:05.670> ring<00:01:07.010> doesn't<00:01:08.010> hit

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
sparker hits the brass ring doesn't hit

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
sparker hits the brass ring doesn't hit
see<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.760> nothing

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
see this actually nothing

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.050 
see this actually nothing
Kaspar<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.479> this<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.520> important<00:01:17.520> part<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Kaspar and this the important part is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.770 
Kaspar and this the important part is
that<00:01:18.240> there's<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:19.020> holes<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.740> there

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
that there's these little holes in there

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.969 
that there's these little holes in there
that<00:01:21.780> were<00:01:21.900> clogged<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:23.960> gas<00:01:24.960> flows<00:01:25.470> through

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that were clogged that gas flows through

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
that were clogged that gas flows through
so<00:01:26.729> wherever<00:01:27.689> these<00:01:28.070> little<00:01:29.070> rings<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so wherever these little rings go on you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
so wherever these little rings go on you
can<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.420> hole<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.909> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
can see this there's a little hole and I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.830 
can see this there's a little hole and I
think<00:01:36.420> gas<00:01:36.659> comes<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:38.310> hole

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
think gas comes out of that little hole

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
think gas comes out of that little hole
and<00:01:39.840> let's<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> find<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> little

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and let's see if I can find that little

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
and let's see if I can find that little
hole<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.000> clogged<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
hole it was clogged there it is so I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.969 
hole it was clogged there it is so I
think<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.540> gas<00:01:45.979> comes

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
think as you can see I think gas comes

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.620 
think as you can see I think gas comes
from<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.970> through<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.869> hole<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
from here through that little hole and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.490 
from here through that little hole and
helps<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.840> ignite<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.500> problems

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
helps it ignite so I have had problems

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.929 
helps it ignite so I have had problems
with<00:01:55.860> slope<00:01:56.549> nishan<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.750> ignition<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
with slope nishan or no ignition and

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.240 
with slope nishan or no ignition and
beings<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.590> some<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:01.979> holes

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
beings that some of these little holes

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.610 
beings that some of these little holes
were<00:02:02.490> plugged<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.969> Oh

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
were plugged up Oh

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.420 
were plugged up Oh
that<00:02:05.010> was<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:07.140> had<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.800> find<00:02:07.980> just<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
that was because I had to find just the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.400 
that was because I had to find just the
right<00:02:08.460> size<00:02:08.880> wire<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.690> who<00:02:09.840> knows<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.290> you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
right size wire and who knows what you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
right size wire and who knows what you
might<00:02:10.619> find<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:12.360> clean<00:02:12.660> those
