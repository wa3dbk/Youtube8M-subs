00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
card if that makes sense to keep the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:16.220 
card if that makes sense to keep the
holes<00:02:04.260> in<00:02:04.500> accessing<00:02:04.770> area

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.789 

no<00:02:17.230> Stan

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.339 

go<00:02:25.799> ahead<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.159> put<00:02:26.280> away<00:02:26.459> your<00:02:26.959> hole<00:02:27.959> puncher

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
go ahead and put away your hole puncher

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.130 
go ahead and put away your hole puncher
and<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.760> ribbon<00:02:30.150> tape

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and now you can get out some ribbon tape

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
and now you can get out some ribbon tape
and<00:02:31.409> you<00:02:32.010> will<00:02:32.129> probably<00:02:32.310> need<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.909> sewing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and you will probably need a sewing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.350 
and you will probably need a sewing
needle<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.750> sewing<00:02:34.019> pin<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.409> this<00:02:34.470> too<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
needle or sewing pin for this too so I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.479 
needle or sewing pin for this too so I
start<00:02:36.629> off<00:02:36.720> by<00:02:36.780> taping<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.349> outside<00:02:38.010> edge<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
start off by taping the outside edge and

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.690 
start off by taping the outside edge and
up<00:02:39.209> two<00:02:40.049> pages<00:02:40.290> together<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.280> center<00:02:41.489> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
up two pages together in the center of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.970 
up two pages together in the center of
the<00:02:41.790> book<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.599> help<00:02:42.750> bind<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.200> book<00:02:43.440> together

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the book to help bind the book together

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.039 
the book to help bind the book together
so<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.819> gonna<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.060> easier<00:02:45.390> put<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
so then it's gonna be easier put the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:56.690 
so then it's gonna be easier put the
ribbon<00:02:46.290> through<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.420> now<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.579> way<00:02:56.579> of

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
ribbon through it and now my way of

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.000 
ribbon through it and now my way of
tying<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.019> put<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.769> ribbon

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
tying it was that I put the ribbon

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.530 
tying it was that I put the ribbon
through<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.819> front<00:03:00.239> across<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.530> two<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.540> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
through the front across the two and and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.319 
through the front across the two and and
then<00:03:03.989> made<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.829> go<00:03:05.099> through<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.790> other<00:03:06.000> holes

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
then made it go through the other holes

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.190 
then made it go through the other holes
back<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> front<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:08.010> tied<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.280> into<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
back to the front and I tied it into a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
back to the front and I tied it into a
bow<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.920> front<00:03:10.950> side

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.180 

oh<00:03:18.320> say<00:03:19.320> can

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.180 

once<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.340> had<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.690> bow<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.650> decided<00:03:29.100> to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
once I had it in a bow I decided to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.340 
once I had it in a bow I decided to
start<00:03:29.370> decorating<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:30.210> this<00:03:30.750> was<00:03:30.930> my<00:03:31.110> way<00:03:31.140> of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
start decorating and this was my way of

start decorating and this was my way of

decorating it but you could decorate it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.770 
decorating it but you could decorate it
any<00:03:33.330> way<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:33.960> so<00:03:34.880> I'm<00:03:35.880> taking<00:03:36.210> my<00:03:36.420> peach

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
ever and I also messed up right here as

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.370 
ever and I also messed up right here as
a<00:04:21.760> mistake<00:04:22.090> because<00:04:22.180> I'm<00:04:22.360> undoing<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.990> ribbon

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
a mistake because I'm undoing the ribbon

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
a mistake because I'm undoing the ribbon
and<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:24.430> was<00:04:24.550> because<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.120> tied<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:26.440> boat<00:04:27.040> so

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and that was because I tied the boat so

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.100 
and that was because I tied the boat so
tight<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.730> I<00:04:27.970> couldn't<00:04:28.540> turn<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.870> pages

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
tight that I couldn't turn the pages

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.220 
tight that I couldn't turn the pages
that<00:04:29.620> was<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.300> wanted<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.840> give<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
that was and so I wanted to give the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.810 
that was and so I wanted to give the
book<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.380> little<00:04:32.620> bit<00:04:32.830> more<00:04:32.980> wiggle<00:04:33.160> room<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:33.790> I

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
book a little bit more wiggle room so I

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.120 
book a little bit more wiggle room so I
recommend<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.390> you<00:04:34.480> don't<00:04:34.720> tie<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.800> ribbon

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
recommend that you don't tie the ribbon

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.460 
recommend that you don't tie the ribbon
or<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> shorter<00:04:36.910> yarn<00:04:37.240> or<00:04:37.510> whatever<00:04:37.780> you're

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
or the shorter yarn or whatever you're

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.830 
or the shorter yarn or whatever you're
using<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:39.100> tie<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.580> because<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.510> gonna<00:04:40.690> be

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
using to tie it because it's gonna be

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.120 
using to tie it because it's gonna be
really<00:04:40.960> difficult<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.440> turn<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.650> pages<00:04:41.890> of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
really difficult to turn the pages of

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.700 
really difficult to turn the pages of
Google<00:04:42.490> sign<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:45.150> now<00:04:46.150> I'm<00:04:46.510> writing<00:04:46.780> 2013
