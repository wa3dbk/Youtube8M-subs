00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
is if if you are going to plant them you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.200 
is if if you are going to plant them you
set<00:00:37.540> it<00:00:37.720> up<00:00:37.870> where<00:00:38.500> it's<00:00:38.950> not<00:00:39.220> popped<00:00:39.610> anymore

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
set it up where it's not popped anymore

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.810

it's not gonna well it some of them will
grow<00:00:46.450> but<00:00:47.280> hardly<00:00:48.280> it<00:00:49.180> will<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:50.500> it's<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:50.980> best

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
grow but hardly it will so it's the best

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.640

now it's time for me to plant this and
the<00:01:41.560> chance<00:01:41.859> of<00:01:42.219> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the chance of it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.949 
the chance of it
sprouting<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:46.499> very<00:01:47.499> very<00:01:47.889> good<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:49.569> seeds

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
sprouting is very very good the seeds

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.730

because<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.219> see<00:01:52.289> it's<00:01:53.289> color<00:01:53.499> has

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
because you can see it's color has

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.230 
because you can see it's color has
ridges<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:56.310> when<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> guys<00:01:57.579> collect<00:01:57.999> one

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
ridges on it when you guys collect one

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.589 
ridges on it when you guys collect one
and<00:01:59.520> they'll<00:02:00.719> ridges<00:02:01.719> on<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:02.310> everywhere<00:02:03.599> but

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
and they'll ridges on it everywhere but

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.840 
and they'll ridges on it everywhere but
this<00:02:04.779> is<00:02:04.990> ready<00:02:05.349> to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
this is ready to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.250 
this is ready to
to<00:02:07.420> plant<00:02:09.450> hopefully<00:02:10.980> get<00:02:11.980> some<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:14.140> I'm

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to plant hopefully get some you what I'm

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.710 
to plant hopefully get some you what I'm
doing<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.040> turning<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:17.069> weight<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.600> mix<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
doing now is turning a weight and mix it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.760 
doing now is turning a weight and mix it
up<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> little<00:02:19.959> bit<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:23.050> next<00:02:23.230> video<00:02:23.410> I'm

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
up a little bit so so the next video I'm

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.340 
up a little bit so so the next video I'm
gonna<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.250> I'm<00:02:24.910> gonna<00:02:25.390> start<00:02:25.750> go<00:02:25.959> ahead<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.260> in

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
gonna do I'm gonna start go ahead and in

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.979 
gonna do I'm gonna start go ahead and in
Planet<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.610> we'll<00:02:30.910> go<00:02:31.180> from<00:02:31.330> there<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
Planet and then we'll go from there and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.370 
Planet and then we'll go from there and
we'll<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:32.950> gonna<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> better

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
we'll see if it's gonna have a better

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.880 
we'll see if it's gonna have a better
chance<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.040> growing<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.840> anyway<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.739> hope

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
chance of it growing so anyway I hope

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.770 
chance of it growing so anyway I hope
