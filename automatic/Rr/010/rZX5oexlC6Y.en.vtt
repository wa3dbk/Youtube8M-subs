00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
myself and I decided to do it myself

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.830 
myself and I decided to do it myself
because<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.190> didn't<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.820> two<00:00:12.509> hundred

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840

dollars to get my hair done so I just

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.660 
dollars to get my hair done so I just
looked<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.270> YouTube<00:00:18.750> video<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.369> do

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
looked up a YouTube video on how to do

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.620 
looked up a YouTube video on how to do
kinky<00:00:20.970> twists<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.699> learned<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
kinky twists and I learned from that and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
kinky twists and I learned from that and
they<00:00:25.140> came<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.680> good<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.189> first

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
they came out pretty good for my first

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
they came out pretty good for my first
try<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:29.029> mean<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.150> did<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> mom<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
try so I mean I did the mom because I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
try so I mean I did the mom because I
like<00:00:31.650> long<00:00:31.859> hair<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.210> how<00:00:33.360> long<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
like long hair so this is how long it is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
like long hair so this is how long it is
and<00:00:35.719> I<00:00:36.719> didn't<00:00:37.050> even<00:00:37.399> curl<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> attempted

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and I didn't even curl well I attempted

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
and I didn't even curl well I attempted
to<00:00:39.780> curl<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.200> ends<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.430> um<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to curl the ends but um I think the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
to curl the ends but um I think the
water<00:00:43.680> cooled<00:00:44.219> off<00:00:44.629> before<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.899> get

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
water cooled off before I can get

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.939 
water cooled off before I can get
through<00:00:46.440> everything<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:49.969> it<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:52.350> looks<00:00:52.649> kind

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
through everything so it it looks kind

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.110 
through everything so it it looks kind
of<00:00:53.010> wavy<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> ends<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.930> um<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
of wavy at the ends really because um it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.790
