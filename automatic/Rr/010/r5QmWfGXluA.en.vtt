00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
accurate because it's usually people

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.340 
accurate because it's usually people
just<00:03:10.280> venting<00:03:10.700> or<00:03:10.970> people<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:11.690> coming<00:03:12.230> up

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.120 
with just you know obnoxious thing maybe
biessing<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.620> let's<00:03:15.769> not<00:03:15.860> hundred<00:03:16.100> percent

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
biessing so let's not hundred percent

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.420 
biessing so let's not hundred percent
accurate<00:03:16.700> but<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.030> watching<00:03:17.209> someone<00:03:17.630> play

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
accurate but just watching someone play

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.580 
accurate but just watching someone play
live<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.480> better<00:03:20.690> indication<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.470> know

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
live it's a better indication you know

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.910 
live it's a better indication you know
it<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:21.860> be<00:03:21.890> miss<00:03:22.280> crude<00:03:22.580> or<00:03:23.739> inaccurate<00:03:24.739> as
