00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and there folks the Filipino very 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.759
 supreme and today I wanna show 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.890
 you a small tutorial of streets and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 avenues in the new yes he said 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.740
 we'll start with the types of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 roads 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.009
 are four types of street and three types of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 avenue 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.090
 separated by density that define the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 number of cars that can pass the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.949
 same time and is also one of the criteria 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.779
 it is necessary for you to increase the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.880
 density of your residential area 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.460
 commercial or industrial 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 you can start with the society 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 low-density dirt roads that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 are the cheapest and then you can 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.399
 upgrade to low density 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.920
 medium and high density 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.829
 What you can not do is give the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.719
 upgrade on your street to a girl then 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 it is very important to decide what you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 wants to be streets and avenues the avenues 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.079
 they are composed there of two streets is in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.449
 parallel and begin with medium density 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.010
 you can upgrade to high and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.590
 high density with rails that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 available is space for the cable car 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.900
 one of the public transport options of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.240
 game let's talk about crosses 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.720
 is that if we take this street of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 high density as a reference if I 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 put another high-density street 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.810
 together with her she will create a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.729
 crossing with the signalmen in the sand 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.680
 they are good for organizing traffic 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.350
 but depending on your design 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 they can cause a major disorder 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.909
 so important to pay attention to them only 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.799
 put a tip is medium density it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.810
 will not create signalers if I put 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.520
 a low will not create and if I 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.189
 put a dirt road it will not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.189
 create in the case of avenues and this is a 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.740
 little different and only expand here only 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.290
 put an avenue with another responds 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.850
 a little bit more 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 an avenue that with this she will create 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.430
 a crossing with the high signal 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.060
 density without rails also average 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.640
 density will create street lights of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 high density will create signalers 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.750
 average density will create 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 low-density street lights will 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.690
 did not create a signal but created in a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.610
 pedestrian strip and low street 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 density 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.490
 I did not raise the signalers if I 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 put that down 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 along with this one with rails here she 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 will not create and if I put this of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.230
 low of terrinha in this with rails note 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.320
 that she will create the signalers 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.290
 the big difference is low density 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.070
 with rails will create and the low 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.110
 without rails will not create the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.270
 crossing is a signalman but he 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.000
 christ ac that enables the cars 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.490
 make returns and create a 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.980
 pedestrian also by personnel cross 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.959
 Let's talk about curves now. 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.900
 which is one of the very important aspects 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.120
 novelty there in the new yes if it is you 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.480
 can do various layouts of ti city 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.590
 come out with rounds with curves the way 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.940
 that you prefer 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.370
 but that's not what I want to address 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.709
 I want to talk about the curves at the time of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.760
 join two streets normally we 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.890
 usually do 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.050
 I'm going to play here for the straight part and it 's going to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.000
 joining two streets and ends up creating a 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.190
 shock 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.590
 Look this is study, it's over. 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.260
 disrupting traffic, not only the cases 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.290
 They take longer to get through but 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.850
 they can also do is balloons here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.230
 they can make a comeback we can 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.060
 observe the same thing with the avenues to 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.190
 francal can make a balloon here like 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.290
 avoid this and make your transit 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.260
 more fluid with the curves 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 you build here makes a curve and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.660
 still sometimes create bugs sometimes 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.489
 they do not look so sharp but that's 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.590
 just a matter of aesthetics and you can 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.540
 erase and try several times there until 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.209
 stay cute but this way you 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.010
 ensures continuous traffic rather than 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.140
 he gets kinda stopped giving more options 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.670
 that the drivers here of returns and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.890
 also stopping here at the time of 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.010
 cross now we 're going to talk about 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.850
 a very very important point is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.010
 the question of needs and streets 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.549
 left to pay here 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.039
 the streets are one of the conditions for 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.900
 defines the density of the area so if you 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.669
 you want normal houses you can 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.200
 put the street under the city 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.000
 but if you want buildings 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.400
 you're going to have to appeal to the high 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.590
 density streets and avenues 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.910
 We're going to put a street here where I 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.250
 I want to show you one thing. 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.630
 extremely important when it comes to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.340
 the design of your city 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.590
 we explain that in areas in the area 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.540
 and here we see that 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.790
 has two green businesses 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.550
 the first one where you will actually be 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.530
 residence and this one indicates the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 she needs to increase the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.200
 diversity 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.790
 so if you want a building and no 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.570
 future for your city ​​by growing 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.210
 population 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.520
 You have to reserve the space here. 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.850
 usually when you build the streets 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.490
 following grid is that the game proposes let's 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.490
 see if he'll show us around here 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.140
 usually it shows but how I am 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.330
 doing a job only showed then 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.220
 here you may be that the game grid is 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.260
 it automatically provides the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.910
 space for an offspring of 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.550
 high density requirement 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.220
 the sale gives right to make a building 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.450
 You can put another house here in the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.730
 time you are starting the game 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.430
 which then the two areas can join 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.780
 to make a building only if I do 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.980
 Here, for example, I put a 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.200
 little more than this size and put 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.020
 So the house will see you up here. 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.950
 she will become a low-income home 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.260
 density 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.920
 but this one will already invade the space of the 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.990
 other 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.830
 I mean you can have a building 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.140
 This side 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.330
 but on this side you will not be able to have 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.020
 will not be able to grow this population 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.190
 in the case of avenues I will put here 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.980
 Let's see if we can get a 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.610
 grid of the 7th attack game the case of 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.100
 avenues 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.490
 the game is already automatically puts the 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.810
 space for two high - rise buildings 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.600
 density so you can put a 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.240
 here below and one up at the time you 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.280
 they clicks grow the density can 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.290
 stay a building under a building 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.770
 this applies also to zones 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.620
 industrial zones 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.200
 very personal this was the basic there in 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.730
 tutorial of streets and avenues and simple and 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.630
 Any questions you can ask us
