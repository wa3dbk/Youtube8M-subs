00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.010
 I also brought him something useful from ErzsÃ©bet 2010 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.010
 and that is a solar device 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.739
 this is the small version 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.089
 Schroders just now 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.279
 that's it, that's it 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.730
 whole charger it counts that is unsustainable 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 has in which country so I can do it so the button 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.029
 Below is a report of the idea 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600
 which indicates that the device is ready 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.460
 Electricity generates so to speak 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
 then I have in the middle of the packaging 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.580
 a Frisbee charger 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 What sure if that does not seem to need it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.650
 various 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.880
 adapter 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.320
 magnificently also really many irritated with it can cover 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 I see here for example 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.870
 rightly 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.170
 then the very small that should have Nokia Store Motorola 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.960
 or you Samsung also seems familiar 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 maybe the second tip for the iPhone should have 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 Also included is a small carving 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.370
 and this cable can be use around 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.720
 connect the charger with one of the beginning provided adaptation 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 For example, I have one here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 there and mini-usb 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.350
 no second and mini-usb is 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 still too big for my phone 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.030
 I have a 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.900
 HD 2 he has Nico 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.870
 I have to connect another adapter 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.760
 but that's no problem 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.740
 so tall 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.940
 I currently have 14 million 72% battery power and if I am now 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.110
 unload with subsequent 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 most recent Slade characters surfaced 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.020
 if I now have the HD2 off switch and 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.479
 There was a try Zepernick wait quarter hour 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.259
 then I have one percent 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.179
 get it when I radiate the device completely then percent could 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 In good light conditions, the device will be complete in about three to four hours 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.839
 to be charged 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.699
 As I said a solar cell only supplies so much energy we Belong light 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:33.129
 is present and therefore vary the loading times, of course, highly dependent 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.589
 from dr around environment bliss 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.049
 but still 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.879
 if you have no outlet at all, this one 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.269
 excellent alternative right now where Belm Green Energy is becoming more and more popular 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.919
 have to come 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.549
 I think so 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.950
 the percent is the right way
