00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.460 
it that's my only drawback if you want
to<00:03:21.720> snipe<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.079> zero<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.950> um<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:24.470> melee

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
to snipe a zero go for it um a melee

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.490 
to snipe a zero go for it um a melee
zero<00:03:25.769> might<00:03:26.250> be<00:03:26.549> pretty<00:03:27.060> cool<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.019> haven't

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
zero might be pretty cool I I haven't

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.490 
zero might be pretty cool I I haven't
tried<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.850> can't<00:03:30.510> imagine<00:03:30.630> it'd<00:03:31.290> be

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
tried it but I I can't imagine it'd be

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.259 
tried it but I I can't imagine it'd be
better<00:03:31.680> than<00:03:31.799> Krieg<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.850> mainly<00:03:33.000> with

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
better than Krieg and I just mainly with

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.600 
better than Krieg and I just mainly with
Krieg<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.140> figured<00:03:34.829> I'd<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> pistol<00:03:35.459> bill

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
Krieg so I figured I'd do a pistol bill

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.490 
Krieg so I figured I'd do a pistol bill
to<00:03:35.760> zero<00:03:36.000> mainly<00:03:36.450> with<00:03:36.570> Krieg<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.140> works<00:03:37.320> out

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
to zero mainly with Krieg it works out

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.009 
to zero mainly with Krieg it works out
great<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.489> hope<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.150> enjoyed<00:03:39.780> this
