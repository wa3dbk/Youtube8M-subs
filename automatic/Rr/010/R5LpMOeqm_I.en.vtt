00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello, I am a Cyrillian serov 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.640
 video in which I continue my lessons 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.040
 playing guitar 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.320
 well for beginners for beginners as 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.420
 these are my first lessons of the previous lesson i 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.920
 showed the first batch of main chords 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.849
 on which most are built 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.949
 yard songs 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.779
 these chords were built in minor and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.580
 Now I will show you four chord 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.140
 now built major and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.859
 accordingly, the song for them will already be 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.189
 funny 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.189
 Well, since Iâ€™m a major and so a chord in A major 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.350
 he sounds like that one more time 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 if brute force something like this 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.930
 next chord d in d major 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.220
 sounds like this 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.220
 if brute force is like this 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 chord g in G major it sounds like this 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 and chord C in C major 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.180
 that's how it sounds 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.890
 and now I'll show you these three chords on 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 an example of a short song 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.000
 so song 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:29.219
 I was setting today 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 spider headwash well that was the answer 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.190
 be in this song 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 logically 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:43.670
 and it does not end she subjugated the weights 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.670
 jump their gang 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.369
