00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.969
 hello and welcome to the survivor 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.070
 academy in this video I show how 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.559
 to add apples to apple jelly and applesauce 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.429
 processed and boil this through 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.429
 can be preserved 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.669
 I collect the fallen ones for that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.200
 possibly undamaged apples on it 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.149
 makes sense to make sure that the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.710
 apples if possible all of one kind 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.800
 even if they are different 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.719
 trees come from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.760
 There are apples firm and mealy the 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.960
 different good for baking or to 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.960
 are suitable for cooking 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.570
 First I want the apples in clear 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.519
 water then I quarter the apples and 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.809
 cuts the core and brown 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.789
 figure out the apple quarters 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.769
 I cut one or two more times 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:02.019
 through and enter in the sieve of 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.640
 juicer pot the sieve with the 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.070
 apple pieces I put on the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.250
 catch it with some water 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.350
 filled in soft pot still 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.409
 put the lid on it and the juicer 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.210
 turn on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.020
 The apple pieces are now through the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.940
 water vapor is released 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.920
 after about 45 minutes are the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.690
 apple pieces clearly boiled down and the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.610
 juice is in the drip tray 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.979
 under the sieve the obtained apple juice 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.440
 which now in a measuring cup around the 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.440
 to determine the required amount of sugar 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.620
 then I read the juice in a saucepan 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.150
 and give after instruction on the pack 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.660
 the appropriate amount of gelierzucker 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.660
 in addition 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.750
 The juice I cook under constant 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.770
 stir and leave it for four minutes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.770
 cooking bubbly 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.229
 Now I can give the hot liquid 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.650
 the previously thoroughly washed off glasses 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.650
 to fill 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.909
 I fill the glasses almost to the edge 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.909
 full and screw the lids tight 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.550
 then I put the glasses on the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.760
 Cover to check if this is fixed 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.190
 close and no gillet leaks through 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.780
 The cooling creates a vacuum and 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.780
 makes it so durable 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.050
 from the cooked apple pieces in the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.300
 sieve of a cooking pot I do now 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.220
 apple sauce I give a portion in 1 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.020
 pass or even see kitchens and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 drive the mass with a round 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.090
 wooden rÃ¼he club through the sieve 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.890
 after each serving I take one 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.680
 spoon the remaining apple 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.720
 shells from the victorious then I stir after 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.500
 taste sugar and a little cinnamon and then 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 is apple must 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.750
 The apple juice I fill only with one 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.380
 spoon in clean glasses with 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.380
 screw cap 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.120
 into the water filled with a little 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.230
 I put a round grid and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.230
 put the glasses inside 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.810
 when the lid is closed, the 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:45.430
 glasses now at 90 for about 30 minutes 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.080
 degree is heated so canned applesauce 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.080
 is durable now
