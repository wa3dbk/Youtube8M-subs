full-grown<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:26.080> set<00:01:26.320> these<00:01:26.470> up<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.920> wild<00:01:27.460> I

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
full-grown to set these up in the wild I

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.060 
full-grown to set these up in the wild I
mean<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.720> captivity<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.530> would<00:01:29.680> want<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.890> try

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
mean in captivity you would want to try

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.710 
mean in captivity you would want to try
to<00:01:30.130> duplicate<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.729> while<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.150> best<00:01:31.329> you<00:01:31.479> can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
to duplicate the while the best you can

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.289 
to duplicate the while the best you can
they're<00:01:32.650> found<00:01:32.979> usually<00:01:33.400> around<00:01:33.610> open<00:01:34.030> water

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.569 
they're found usually around open water
so<00:01:35.229> they<00:01:35.320> wouldn't<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.740> large<00:01:35.979> water<00:01:36.280> bowl

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579
