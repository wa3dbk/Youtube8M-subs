it<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.520> actual<00:02:18.760> program<00:02:19.210> itself<00:02:19.660> and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
it this is the actual program itself and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
it this is the actual program itself and
all<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:20.920> need<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.340> at<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.460> point<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:22.120> come

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
all we need to do at this point is come

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.390 
all we need to do at this point is come
down<00:02:22.720> here<00:02:22.990> where<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.170> says<00:02:23.200> burn<00:02:23.590> ISO<00:02:24.070> image

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
down here where it says burn ISO image

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.610 
down here where it says burn ISO image
click<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.360> click<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.440> ok<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
select an ISO image to burn so go out to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.500 
select an ISO image to burn so go out to
where<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.500> downloaded<00:02:35.680> your<00:02:36.190> Ubuntu<00:02:36.520> this

finalized disc make sure that is checked

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.510 
finalized disc make sure that is checked

and then eject disk after burning once

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.090 
and then eject disk after burning once
everything<00:02:54.850> looks<00:02:54.880> ok<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:56.080> can<00:02:56.230> go<00:02:56.380> ahead<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
everything looks ok you can go ahead the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.010 
everything looks ok you can go ahead the
last<00:02:57.340> word<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.700> advice<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.150> would<00:02:58.300> say<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:58.810> is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
last word of advice I would say to do is

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.590 
last word of advice I would say to do is
if<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.070> pull<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.460> down<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.880> there<00:03:01.030> speeds<00:03:01.450> in

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
if you pull this down in there speeds in

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.660 
if you pull this down in there speeds in
here<00:03:01.780> slower<00:03:02.140> than<00:03:02.440> your<00:03:02.560> highest<00:03:03.070> maximum

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
here slower than your highest maximum

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.450 
here slower than your highest maximum
speed<00:03:04.110> slow<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.320> disc<00:03:05.590> burn<00:03:05.830> down<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.130> little

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
speed slow this disc burn down a little

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.580 
speed slow this disc burn down a little
bit<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.820> did<00:03:06.970> find<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.420> first<00:03:07.660> disc<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.080> am<00:03:08.260> burnt

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
bit I did find the first disc I am burnt

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.650 
bit I did find the first disc I am burnt
free<00:03:08.800> Ubuntu<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> burn<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.670> really<00:03:10.090> really<00:03:10.360> fast

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
free Ubuntu I burn it really really fast

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.160 
free Ubuntu I burn it really really fast
and<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:12.160> basically<00:03:12.910> crapped<00:03:13.630> out<00:03:13.840> right<00:03:14.080> in

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and it basically crapped out right in

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.300 
and it basically crapped out right in
the<00:03:14.200> middle<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:14.920> didn't<00:03:15.130> work<00:03:15.280> for

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
the middle of it so it didn't work for

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.440 
the middle of it so it didn't work for
me<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.390> pull<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:16.900> down<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.760> select<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.910> lower

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
me so pull this down and select a lower

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.510 
me so pull this down and select a lower
bitrate<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.530> burn<00:03:20.739> at<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.220> gonna<00:03:21.280> take<00:03:21.489> a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
bitrate to burn at it's gonna take a

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.250 
bitrate to burn at it's gonna take a
little<00:03:21.640> bit<00:03:21.790> longer<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.270> it's<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.450> better<00:03:22.630> burn

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.229 

once<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.380> do<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.739> get<00:03:27.489> everything<00:03:27.730> set<00:03:28.090> up

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
once you do that get everything set up

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.360 
once you do that get everything set up
the<00:03:28.480> burn<00:03:28.900> method<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.590> automatically

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
the burn method is just automatically

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.729 
the burn method is just automatically
then<00:03:30.640> hit<00:03:30.820> burn<00:03:31.060> disk<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.200> for<00:03:35.440> those<00:03:35.560> out

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
then hit burn disk now for those out

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.350 
then hit burn disk now for those out
there<00:03:35.770> with<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> Mac<00:03:36.310> let's<00:03:36.910> switch<00:03:37.150> out<00:03:37.330> of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
there with a Mac let's switch out of

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.300 
there with a Mac let's switch out of
this<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:41.290> we're<00:03:41.440> gonna<00:03:41.530> actually<00:03:41.680> minimize

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
this and we're gonna actually minimize

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.130 
this and we're gonna actually minimize
my<00:03:42.550> windows<00:03:43.030> all<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.330> way<00:03:43.450> here<00:03:43.720> we'll<00:03:44.110> just

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
my windows all the way here we'll just

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.600 
my windows all the way here we'll just
get<00:03:44.410> rid<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:46.830> ok<00:03:47.830> now<00:03:48.070> I'm<00:03:48.190> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.430> show

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
ISO instead of burning it and then

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.180 
ISO instead of burning it and then
