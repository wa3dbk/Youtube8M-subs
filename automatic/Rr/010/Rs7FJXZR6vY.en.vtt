which you will I feel like the

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.979 
which you will I feel like the
environments<00:03:55.030> could<00:03:55.180> have<00:03:55.269> benefited<00:03:55.720> from<00:03:55.750> a

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
environments could have benefited from a

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.229 
environments could have benefited from a
little<00:03:56.290> more<00:03:56.440> personality<00:03:57.069> as<00:03:57.220> well<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
little more personality as well the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.970 
little more personality as well the
tribal<00:03:58.569> theme<00:03:58.659> is<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> cool<00:03:59.110> idea<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.769> once

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
tribal theme is a cool idea but once

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.350 
tribal theme is a cool idea but once
again<00:04:00.099> the<00:04:00.280> developers<00:04:00.700> seem<00:04:00.909> to<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.180> fallen

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
again the developers seem to have fallen

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.149 
again the developers seem to have fallen
into<00:04:01.629> this<00:04:01.810> idea<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.200> there<00:04:02.530> are<00:04:02.620> only<00:04:02.769> three

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
into this idea that there are only three

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.920 
into this idea that there are only three
colors<00:04:03.580> in<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.909> borderlands<00:04:04.390> palette<00:04:04.720> range

colors in the borderlands palette range

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.990 
colors in the borderlands palette range
