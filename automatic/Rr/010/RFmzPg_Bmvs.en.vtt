no<00:03:22.370> way<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.480> bullet<00:03:23.780> hit<00:03:23.990> all<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.410> them

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530

because<00:03:24.710> I'm<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:25.040> man<00:03:25.220> aiming<00:03:25.790> for<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.270> middle
