hissing wastes I don't know where that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
hissing wastes I don't know where that
is<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.670> haven't<00:01:32.850> unlocked<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.570> all

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is because I haven't unlocked it at all

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.990

somewhere<00:01:39.570> around<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.930> maybe<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.250> sure

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
somewhere around here maybe I'm not sure

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
somewhere around here maybe I'm not sure
I<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.930> won't<00:01:43.140> miss<00:01:43.320> it
