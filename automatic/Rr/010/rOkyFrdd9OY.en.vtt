level<00:02:26.050> 6<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.950> believe<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:29.050> mean

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
level 6 is like I believe one so I mean

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530 
level 6 is like I believe one so I mean
you're<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.440> missing<00:02:30.100> out<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.540> with

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
you're not missing out on much with

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.480 
you're not missing out on much with
separate<00:02:31.959> level<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
separate level for you know with the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.250 
separate level for you know with the
support<00:02:33.940> there<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.870> great<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
support there and it's great just to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.740 
support there and it's great just to
have<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.470> power<00:02:35.740> house<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> board<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
have that power house on the board you

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.240 
have that power house on the board you
know<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.930> worry<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:38.560> less<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:39.100> know

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
know you worry a little less you know

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.460 
know you worry a little less you know
that<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> plus<00:02:40.300> 9<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:41.380> you

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
that you have that plus 9 so when you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.170 
that you have that plus 9 so when you
calculate<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.980> challenge<00:02:42.490> out<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:42.970> kind

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
calculate your challenge out it's kind

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.820 
calculate your challenge out it's kind
of<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> given<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.530> kind<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.770> just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
of like a given and you can kind of just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.080 
of like a given and you can kind of just
add<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.160> in

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
add it in

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.850 
add it in
and<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.629> know<00:02:46.750> plus<00:02:46.959> nine<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.379> most<00:02:47.650> likely

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and you know plus nine you most likely

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.860 
and you know plus nine you most likely
just<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.000> you're<00:02:49.150> starting<00:02:49.450> off<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.720> that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
just if you're starting off with that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.050 
just if you're starting off with that
plus<00:02:50.170> your<00:02:50.410> player<00:02:50.980> card<00:02:51.010> whatever<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.940> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
plus your player card whatever it's a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.509 
plus your player card whatever it's a
attack<00:02:52.989> value<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.190> going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.459> be

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
attack value is it's just going to be

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.880 
attack value is it's just going to be
very<00:02:55.150> destructive<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.989> probably<00:02:56.440> very<00:02:56.590> hard

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
very destructive and probably very hard

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.020 
very destructive and probably very hard
for<00:02:57.069> your<00:02:57.099> opponent<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.519> deal<00:02:57.730> with<00:02:57.879> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
for your opponent to deal with that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.490 
for your opponent to deal with that
unless<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.629> a<00:02:58.660> keyblade<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.290> their

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
unless they have a keyblade in their

unless they have a keyblade in their
hand<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.849> don't<00:03:01.150> then<00:03:02.140> otherwise<00:03:02.709> it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
hand and you don't then otherwise it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.320 
hand and you don't then otherwise it's
really<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.549> going<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.849> much<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.209> they're

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
really not going to be much that they're

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.789 
really not going to be much that they're
going<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.510> be<00:03:04.599> able<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.230> mean<00:03:05.709> unless

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
going to be able to do I mean unless

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.350 
going to be able to do I mean unless
it's<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.459> only<00:03:06.549> friend<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.970> have<00:03:07.000> or

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's like the only friend you have or

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.059 
it's like the only friend you have or
something<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:07.959> even<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.560> don't<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
something but even so you don't have to

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.770 
something but even so you don't have to
discard<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:09.849> even<00:03:10.030> if<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.360> throw<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.690> in

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
discard it so even if you throw it in

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.050 
discard it so even if you throw it in
and<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.950> know<00:03:12.040> they<00:03:12.190> use<00:03:12.400> something<00:03:12.849> in<00:03:12.970> the

and you know they use something in the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.240 
and you know they use something in the
challenge<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.690> stop<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.530> lose<00:03:14.709> an<00:03:14.920> HP

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
challenge to stop it and you lose an HP

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.860 
challenge to stop it and you lose an HP
because<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.610> can<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.910> something<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.780> know
