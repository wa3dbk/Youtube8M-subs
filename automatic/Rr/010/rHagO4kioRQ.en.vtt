00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.330
 The essay protected EA's report but I believe it had protected it 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.290
 is already three or lives 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.380
 April 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.850

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 bad 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.300
 that was already so far that are now afraid many of these titles Big Apple 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.860

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 back across the screen 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.789

 Percent up the city day demanded the Marburger stand reported 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.759

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.739
 costs 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.589
