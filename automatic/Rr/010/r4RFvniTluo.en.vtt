00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right why thought I'd shoot a little

the<00:00:11.660> new<00:00:12.660> hybrid<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:14.240> 750<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:17.760> reason

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the new hybrid is 750 and the reason

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.450 
the new hybrid is 750 and the reason
it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.210> hybrid<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> uses<00:00:19.460> two

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it's a hybrid is because it uses two

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.330 
it's a hybrid is because it uses two
different<00:00:20.730> types<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> pump<00:00:21.240> configurations

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
different types of pump configurations

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.910 
different types of pump configurations
it<00:00:23.340> has<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.730> pump<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.199> there<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:25.769> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it has one pump that one there which is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
it has one pump that one there which is
the<00:00:26.099> what's<00:00:26.910> called<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> flow<00:00:27.420> through<00:00:27.810> pump

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the what's called the flow through pump

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
the what's called the flow through pump
so<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.890> pulls<00:00:29.099> water<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> sump<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so it pulls water from the sump from the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
so it pulls water from the sump from the
venturi<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.309> right<00:00:32.309> there

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
venturi there right there

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
venturi there right there
and<00:00:33.480> injects<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> into<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> body<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and injects it into the body and then it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.330 
and injects it into the body and then it
flows<00:00:35.640> through<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.680> Notley<00:00:38.040> outlet

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
flows through and the Notley outlet

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.049 
flows through and the Notley outlet
assembly<00:00:38.670> there

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
assembly there

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.040 
assembly there
the<00:00:40.020> other<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.410> pumps<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:42.360> you're<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.719> here

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.680 

our<00:00:47.880> recirculating<00:00:48.880> pumps<00:00:49.240> so<00:00:49.390> they<00:00:49.510> pull

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
our recirculating pumps so they pull

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.150 
our recirculating pumps so they pull
water<00:00:49.900> from<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.260> bottom<00:00:50.560> of<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:50.740> cup<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:51.040> the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
water from the bottom of the cup of the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.030 
water from the bottom of the cup of the
reaction<00:00:51.760> chamber<00:00:52.150> and<00:00:52.650> mix<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.770> with<00:00:53.860> their

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
reaction chamber and mix it with their

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.790 
reaction chamber and mix it with their
shredded-up<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.730> inject<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.090> back<00:00:55.150> in<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
shredded-up and inject it back in and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.370 
shredded-up and inject it back in and
that<00:00:57.460> allows<00:00:58.150> us<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:59.160> have<00:01:01.110> less<00:01:02.110> water

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
that allows us to have less water

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.840 
that allows us to have less water
flowing<00:01:02.980> through<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.250> reaction<00:01:03.580> chamber

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
flowing through the reaction chamber

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.840 
flowing through the reaction chamber
which<00:01:04.449> increases<00:01:04.960> contact<00:01:05.440> time<00:01:05.850> more

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
which increases contact time more

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.840 
which increases contact time more
control<00:01:07.300> over<00:01:07.330> contact<00:01:08.080> time<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:09.190> optimizes

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
control over contact time and optimizes

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.410 
control over contact time and optimizes
pump<00:01:10.090> efficiency<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.560> instead<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:11.860> having<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
pump efficiency so instead of having you

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.050 
pump efficiency so instead of having you
know<00:01:14.130> 1,500<00:01:15.130> or<00:01:15.190> 2,000<00:01:15.670> gallons<00:01:15.880> an<00:01:16.000> hour

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
know 1,500 or 2,000 gallons an hour

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.450 
know 1,500 or 2,000 gallons an hour
pouring<00:01:16.510> out<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.900> outlet<00:01:17.140> assembly<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:18.340> have

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
pouring out the outlet assembly you have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.280 
pouring out the outlet assembly you have
a<00:01:18.520> lot<00:01:18.670> finer<00:01:18.880> control<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.140> will

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
a lot finer control so this will

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.690 
a lot finer control so this will
increase<00:01:20.500> overall<00:01:20.890> skimming<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.310> pitcher<00:01:21.550> so

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
increase overall skimming the pitcher so

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.030 
increase overall skimming the pitcher so
you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.470> foam<00:01:23.710> 8<00:01:23.890> this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
you can see that's up a foam 8 this

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
you can see that's up a foam 8 this
thing<00:01:24.220> makes<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.300> just<00:01:25.740> nice<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.130> dense

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
thing makes it is just nice and dense

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.630 
thing makes it is just nice and dense
it's<00:01:29.200> already<00:01:30.000> getting<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.060> nice<00:01:32.430> layer<00:01:33.430> of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
it's already getting a nice layer of

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.080 
it's already getting a nice layer of
stem<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.090> there<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.640> movement<00:01:36.940> in<00:01:37.000> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
stem in there and the movement in the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.600 
stem in there and the movement in the
transaction<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.960> smooth<00:01:38.830> then<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.399> body

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
transaction is smooth then on the body

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.280 
transaction is smooth then on the body
it's<00:01:39.820> smooth

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
it's smooth

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.990 
it's smooth
we<00:01:41.740> actually<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.130> wire<00:01:42.280> level<00:01:42.580> kind<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.850> low

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
we actually the wire level kind of low

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.690 
we actually the wire level kind of low
so<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.570> little<00:01:43.930> more<00:01:44.160> larger<00:01:45.160> bubbles<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.580> here

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
so a little more larger bubbles in here

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.250 
so a little more larger bubbles in here
just<00:01:45.880> because<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.180> has<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.540> be<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.780> low<00:01:46.960> cuz<00:01:47.170> I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
just because it has to be that low cuz I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.140 
just because it has to be that low cuz I
the<00:01:48.010> protein<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.730> system<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.150> these

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
the protein in the system and these

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.600 
the protein in the system and these
pumps<00:01:52.510> are<00:01:52.600> pulling<00:01:52.900> in<00:01:52.990> about<00:01:53.230> 19<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.310> 20

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
pumps are pulling in about 19 to 20

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.170 
pumps are pulling in about 19 to 20
litres<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:55.000> minute<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.420> air<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:58.150> you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
litres a minute of air so if you

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.400 
litres a minute of air so if you
multiply<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.690> by<00:01:58.750> 3<00:01:59.170> you're<00:01:59.380> looking<00:01:59.680> at<00:01:59.830> 38

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
multiply that by 3 you're looking at 38

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.530 
multiply that by 3 you're looking at 38
about<00:02:02.410> 57<00:02:03.310> litres<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.030> almost<00:02:04.150> 60

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
about 57 litres and then it almost 60

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.070 
about 57 litres and then it almost 60
litres<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.840> minute<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.260> air<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.630> that's<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.020> lot

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
litres a minute of air and that's a lot

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.560 
litres a minute of air and that's a lot
so<00:02:11.080> per<00:02:11.740> hour<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.040> about<00:02:12.190> 3,600<00:02:13.000> litres<00:02:13.300> an

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
so per hour it's about 3,600 litres an

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.890 
so per hour it's about 3,600 litres an
hour<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:14.140> air<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.980> that's<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.940> 36<00:02:16.480> inch<00:02:16.600> tall

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
hour of air and that's a 36 inch tall

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530 
hour of air and that's a 36 inch tall
skimmer<00:02:17.230> 12<00:02:17.590> inches<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.980> diameter<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.640> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
skimmer 12 inches in diameter and you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
skimmer 12 inches in diameter and you
