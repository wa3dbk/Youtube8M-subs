from my PRS SE to 4/5 which is a lovely
guitar<00:01:02.539> into<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.690> Zen<00:01:04.049> Drive<00:01:04.260> pedal<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> then

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
guitar into my Zen Drive pedal and then

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.190 
guitar into my Zen Drive pedal and then
straight<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> fender<00:01:06.330> blues<00:01:06.450> jr.<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
straight into the fender blues jr. and
MacLean<00:01:07.530> sound<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:09.150> this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.510 

with<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> Zen<00:01:17.140> drive<00:01:17.410> engaged<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.400> low

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
with the Zen drive engaged in the low

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:41.109 
with the Zen drive engaged in the low
gain<00:01:18.760> sound<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.630> what<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.930> get

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.359 

so<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.049> can<00:01:42.170> agree<00:01:42.469> it's<00:01:42.590> very<00:01:42.799> lush<00:01:43.070> sang

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
so you can agree it's very lush sang

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.130 
so you can agree it's very lush sang
with<00:01:43.549> cords<00:01:44.000> now<00:01:44.600> as<00:01:44.719> I<00:01:44.780> was<00:01:44.869> talking<00:01:45.109> about

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
with cords now as I was talking about

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.349 
with cords now as I was talking about
earlier<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.770> Zen<00:01:46.070> Drive<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.640> very<00:01:47.030> tight

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
earlier the Zen Drive is very tight

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.440 
earlier the Zen Drive is very tight
responsive<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.439> demonstrate<00:01:48.619> this

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
responsive and just to demonstrate this

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.690 
responsive and just to demonstrate this
my<00:01:50.450> volume<00:01:50.780> fill<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.079> on<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.289> guitar<00:01:51.619> I'm<00:01:52.429> just

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
my volume fill up on the guitar I'm just

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.240 
my volume fill up on the guitar I'm just
gonna<00:01:52.819> change<00:01:53.090> my<00:01:53.329> picking<00:01:53.600> dynamics<00:01:54.109> to<00:01:55.009> show

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
gonna change my picking dynamics to show

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:39.430 
gonna change my picking dynamics to show
you<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> difference<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:55.880> sound

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.230 

so<00:02:40.440> again<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> big<00:02:41.250> difference<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.820> by

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
so again a big difference just by

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.030 
so again a big difference just by
changing<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:42.780> picking<00:02:43.050> dynamics<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
changing or picking dynamics but the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040 
changing or picking dynamics but the
gain<00:02:44.190> turned<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.730> slightly<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.420> Zen<00:02:45.600> drive<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
gain turned up slightly the Zen drive is

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
gain turned up slightly the Zen drive is
capable<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.500> producing<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.190> most<00:02:47.340> delicious

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
capable of producing the most delicious

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.090 
capable of producing the most delicious
lead<00:02:48.120> sound<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.290> sounds<00:02:49.680> something<00:02:49.980> like

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
lead sound and it sounds something like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:48.289 
lead sound and it sounds something like
this

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.449
