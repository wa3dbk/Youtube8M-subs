00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
can actually make with this case so what

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.860 
can actually make with this case so what
we're<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.849> do<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.239> we're<00:02:19.720> going<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.350 
we're going to do is we're going to
bring<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.440> up<00:02:20.530> like<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.769> stand<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.150> is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
bring it up like a stand and this is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.809 
bring it up like a stand and this is
actually<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.140> stands<00:02:23.620> right<00:02:23.950> here<00:02:24.400> it

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
actually one of the stands right here it

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.940 
actually one of the stands right here it
actually<00:02:25.060> holds<00:02:25.480> up<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:26.050> these<00:02:26.260> indents<00:02:26.800> on

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
actually holds up in these indents on

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.089 
actually holds up in these indents on
your<00:02:27.370> case<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.720> have<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
your case so we have one right here and

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.680 
your case so we have one right here and
then<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.370> another<00:02:30.400> indent<00:02:31.120> lower<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
then we have another indent lower and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.180 
then we have another indent lower and
these<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:31.959> actually<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.440> only<00:02:32.620> two<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:33.010> have

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
these are actually the only two we have

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.640 
these are actually the only two we have
so<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:34.090> two<00:02:34.330> choices<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:35.019> stands<00:02:35.349> this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
so you have two choices of stands this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.680 
so you have two choices of stands this
actually<00:02:36.250> gives<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.550> higher<00:02:36.849> view<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.269> would
