00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
hey there everybody Phil here for

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.570 
hey there everybody Phil here for
android<00:00:06.870> central.com<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.620> we've<00:00:08.040> got<00:00:08.250> four

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
android central.com and we've got four

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.830 
android central.com and we've got four
phones<00:00:08.820> lined<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.510> they<00:00:09.690> got

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
phones lined up and they got

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.690 
phones lined up and they got
fingerprints<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.500> them<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.070> means<00:00:11.490> one

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
fingerprints on them so that means one

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
fingerprints on them so that means one
thing<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:12.090> time<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.360> benchmark<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.380> we've

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
thing it's time to benchmark so we've

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.020 
thing it's time to benchmark so we've
got<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> motorola<00:00:14.099> droid<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
got the motorola droid with the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.410 
got the motorola droid with the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
relatively stock android 2.1 on it

relatively stock android 2.1 on it
cyanogenmod<00:00:19.140> rom<00:00:19.580> we've<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> nexus<00:00:21.090> one

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
cyanogenmod rom we've got the nexus one

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
cyanogenmod rom we've got the nexus one
with<00:00:21.449> froyo<00:00:21.900> we've<00:00:22.439> got<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> new<00:00:22.890> HTC<00:00:23.160> aria

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
with froyo we've got the new HTC aria

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.290 
with froyo we've got the new HTC aria
from<00:00:24.029> AT&amp;T<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.380> we've<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.369> sprint<00:00:26.970> EVO

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
from AT&amp;T and we've got the sprint EVO

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.769 
from AT&amp;T and we've got the sprint EVO
4G<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:28.949> let's<00:00:29.160> run<00:00:29.340> linpack<00:00:30.029> test<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
4G so first let's run linpack test the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.610 
4G so first let's run linpack test the
cpu<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.679> quick<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:33.410> how<00:00:34.410> many

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
cpu and how quick it is how many

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760 
cpu and how quick it is how many
floating<00:00:35.690> point<00:00:36.690> operations<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.559> run

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
floating point operations that can run

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.660 
floating point operations that can run
so<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.790> you've<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.980> 6.75<00:00:40.980> mflops

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so there you go you've got 6.75 mflops

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.889 
so there you go you've got 6.75 mflops
on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> evo<00:00:44.690> 3.8<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.530> Aria<00:00:47.210> 28.6<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.510> the

on the evo 3.8 on the Aria 28.6 on the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
on the evo 3.8 on the Aria 28.6 on the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
evo on the Nexus One and 4.3 on the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
evo on the Nexus One and 4.3 on the
droid<00:00:52.410> we'll<00:00:52.860> run<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> again<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
droid we'll run it again here now the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
droid we'll run it again here now the
nexus<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> loads

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
nexus one is just going to be loads

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
nexus one is just going to be loads
faster<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.329> froyo<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.109> an

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
faster because it has froyo and it's an

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
faster because it has froyo and it's an
actual<00:00:58.620> build<00:00:59.399> intended<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> nexus<00:01:00.449> one

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actual build intended for the nexus one

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.139 
actual build intended for the nexus one
and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> just-in-time<00:01:01.680> compiler<00:01:02.579> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and it has the just-in-time compiler so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.020 
and it has the just-in-time compiler so
see<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.809> 38<00:01:04.199> m<00:01:04.320> flops<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.890> versus<00:01:05.369> four

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
see we got 38 m flops there versus four

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.410 
see we got 38 m flops there versus four
and<00:01:06.390> three<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.049> six<00:01:07.590> any<00:01:08.159> other<00:01:08.280> phones<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and three and six any other phones so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
and three and six any other phones so
the<00:01:09.689> aria<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the aria you know it's right there in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.660 
the aria you know it's right there in
line<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.150> pretty<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.990> we'd<00:01:13.140> expect

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
line with pretty much what we'd expect

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.840 
line with pretty much what we'd expect
now<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.030> run<00:01:15.330> quadrant<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> fun

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
now let's run quadrant this is that fun

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
now let's run quadrant this is that fun
little<00:01:18.000> test<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.600> does<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.080> sorts<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> stuff

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
little test that does all sorts of stuff

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
little test that does all sorts of stuff
and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.130> spits<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> nice<00:01:20.970> fat<00:01:21.420> number<00:01:21.780> at

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and then spits out a nice fat number at

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
and then spits out a nice fat number at
the<00:01:21.930> end<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.920> compare<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> other

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the end so you can compare it to other

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
the end so you can compare it to other
phones<00:01:23.880> doesn't<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:25.020> break<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
phones doesn't really break down the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.740 
phones doesn't really break down the
results<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> other

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
results the way that some of the other

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.719 
results the way that some of the other
tests<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.520> swimming

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
tests do but you know swimming

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.219 
tests do but you know swimming
everything's<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> up-and-up<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
everything's on the up-and-up you can

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.700 
everything's on the up-and-up you can
compare<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.549> let's<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
compare things that way so let's do that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.749 
compare things that way so let's do that
obviously<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> nexus<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.430> running<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
obviously the nexus one is running a

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.010 
obviously the nexus one is running a
little<00:01:35.939> faster<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.420> again<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
little faster here again it's that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
little faster here again it's that
just-in-time<00:01:37.380> compiler<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
just-in-time compiler it really really

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
just-in-time compiler it really really
speeds<00:01:39.570> things<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> can't<00:01:40.470> wait<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> get

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
speeds things up and I can't wait to get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
speeds things up and I can't wait to get
it<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.130> other<00:01:41.310> phones<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> evo<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it on other phones like the evo and the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.649 
it on other phones like the evo and the
droid<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> Aria<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.909> mean<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.509> going

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
droid two and the Aria I mean it's going

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.060 
droid two and the Aria I mean it's going
to<00:01:45.720> speed<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.860> going

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to speed everything up it's really going

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
to speed everything up it's really going
to<00:01:47.130> change<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.460> life<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.229> all<00:01:49.229> right

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to change your life it will all right

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.600 
to change your life it will all right
maybe<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.829> life<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.250> it'll<00:01:50.430> change

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
maybe not your life but it'll change

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480 
maybe not your life but it'll change
your<00:01:50.790> phone<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> lot<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.979> here<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.310> one

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
people are talking about how the evo

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.090 
people are talking about how the evo
appears<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> be<00:04:26.050> capped<00:04:26.320> at<00:04:26.530> 30<00:04:26.710> frames<00:04:26.860> per

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
appears to be capped at 30 frames per

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.300 
appears to be capped at 30 frames per
second<00:04:27.669> there's<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.540> Aria<00:04:28.870> hitting<00:04:29.800> 60<00:04:30.190> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
second there's the Aria hitting 60 and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.020 
second there's the Aria hitting 60 and
change<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> nexus<00:04:32.380> 1<00:04:32.650> 60<00:04:33.310> something<00:04:33.760> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
change is the nexus 1 60 something and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.330 
change is the nexus 1 60 something and
the<00:04:34.360> droids<00:04:34.630> poking<00:04:35.200> right<00:04:35.380> along<00:04:35.680> there<00:04:35.919> 30

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
the droids poking right along there 30

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.700 
the droids poking right along there 30
as<00:04:36.550> well<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.050> think<00:04:38.169> that's<00:04:38.440> pretty<00:04:38.590> obvious

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
as well so I think that's pretty obvious

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.760 
as well so I think that's pretty obvious
in<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.669> time<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.180> heck<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:41.140> droid<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
in the time the heck the droid and the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.409 
in the time the heck the droid and the
evo<00:04:42.070> are<00:04:42.220> still<00:04:42.430> going<00:04:42.610> we<00:04:42.880> can<00:04:43.000> run<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.300> other

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
evo are still going we can run the other

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:51.780 
evo are still going we can run the other
two<00:04:43.630> twice<00:04:44.430> interesting<00:04:49.830> there<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.010> go<00:04:51.160> 1000

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
two twice interesting there you go 1000

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.520 
two twice interesting there you go 1000
iterations<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.510> sure<00:04:52.810> took<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.230> long<00:04:53.380> enough

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
iterations that sure took it long enough

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.730 
iterations that sure took it long enough
and<00:04:53.860> it's<00:04:54.419> everything<00:04:55.419> about<00:04:55.690> 30<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.380> that's<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
and it's everything about 30 so that's a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.780 
and it's everything about 30 so that's a
big<00:04:56.890> difference<00:04:57.010> between<00:04:57.430> all<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.610> phones

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
big difference between all the phones

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.810 
big difference between all the phones
they're<00:04:58.590> all<00:04:59.590> right<00:04:59.919> everybody<00:05:00.430> that's<00:05:00.729> a

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
they're all right everybody that's a

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.280 
they're all right everybody that's a
decent<00:05:01.000> little<00:05:01.330> test<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.780> benchmarking

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
decent little test of benchmarking

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.409 
decent little test of benchmarking
between<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.740> Aria<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.280> evo<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.790> droid<00:05:04.060> and

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
between the Aria the evo the droid and

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.669 
between the Aria the evo the droid and
the<00:05:05.320> nexus<00:05:05.590> one<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.070> we'll<00:05:06.340> see<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.490> later
