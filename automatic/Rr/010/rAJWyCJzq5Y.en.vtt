00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.509 
now I think there are 16 competitors
registered<00:02:09.119> 15<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.599> 16<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.229> maybe<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.340> couple

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
registered 15 or 16 and maybe a couple

more<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> come<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.150> were<00:02:12.239> hinting<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.629> so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
more to come they were hinting about so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.369 
more to come they were hinting about so
that<00:02:13.920> should<00:02:14.069> be<00:02:14.099> interesting<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.790> and
