but David I'm looking at Psalm 51 there
are<00:02:23.440> many<00:02:23.710> things<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.100> minister<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.880> me<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.360> I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
are many things that minister to me if I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.000 
are many things that minister to me if I
didn't<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> New<00:02:26.260> Testament<00:02:26.290> said

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
didn't know what the New Testament said

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.380 
didn't know what the New Testament said
with<00:02:27.280> regard<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> verses<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.120> just

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
with regard to the verses you just

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.160 
with regard to the verses you just
quoted<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:29.020> I'd<00:02:29.650> be<00:02:29.830> confused<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.840> it's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
quoted I I'd be confused here but it's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
quoted I I'd be confused here but it's
not<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.620> difficult<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.300> read<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
not that difficult if you just read the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610 
not that difficult if you just read the
Word<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.490> God<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:37.660> you're<00:02:37.930> able<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> make
