quality quad core cpu obviously it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.099 
quality quad core cpu obviously it
doesn't<00:00:29.939> compete<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.570> something<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.990> an

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
doesn't compete with something like an

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.940 
doesn't compete with something like an
i5<00:00:31.529> 3570k<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.880> 4670k<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> does<00:00:34.530> compete

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
i5 3570k or 4670k but it does compete

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
i5 3570k or 4670k but it does compete
with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> i3<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> i3<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.930> forty<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
with the i3 and the i3 is about forty to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.840 
with the i3 and the i3 is about forty to
fifty<00:00:37.739> dollars<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.100> expensive<00:00:38.670> actually

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
fifty dollars more expensive actually

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.630 
fifty dollars more expensive actually
and<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> FX<00:00:40.559> 4300<00:00:41.219> since<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> has

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and you know the FX 4300 since it has

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
and you know the FX 4300 since it has
four<00:00:41.940> physical<00:00:42.239> cores<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:43.050> performs

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
four physical cores actually performs

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.139 
four physical cores actually performs
better<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> things<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.340> video<00:00:44.610> editing

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
better in things like video editing

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
better in things like video editing
rendering<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> live<00:00:46.590> streaming<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> things

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
rendering and live streaming and things

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
rendering and live streaming and things
like<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.780> with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> FX<00:00:49.200> 4300<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> won't<00:00:50.129> be

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
like that with the FX 4300 you won't be

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
like that with the FX 4300 you won't be
able<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.610> live<00:00:50.850> streaming<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.960> much

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
able to do live streaming all that much

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
able to do live streaming all that much
on<00:00:52.500> higher-end<00:00:52.739> games<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> want<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
on higher-end games but if you want to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.830 
on higher-end games but if you want to
play<00:00:54.000> something<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.300> League<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
play something like League you can

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.310 
play something like League you can
perfectly<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> perfectly<00:00:56.820> fine<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
perfectly do that perfectly fine so the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.069 
perfectly do that perfectly fine so the
FX<00:00:58.590> 4300<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.640> great<00:00:59.969> CPU<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.020> know

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
FX 4300 is a really great CPU and I know

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
FX 4300 is a really great CPU and I know
are<00:01:01.500> more<00:01:01.859> people<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.670> siding<00:01:03.390> with

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
are more people are you know siding with

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.469 
are more people are you know siding with
the<00:01:03.539> FX<00:01:03.899> 6300<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.650> even<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> 8350<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
the FX 6300 or even the 8350 and you
know<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.810> towards<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> quad<00:01:07.830> core<00:01:08.130> plus

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
know going towards that quad core plus

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120 
know going towards that quad core plus
CP<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.720> quad<00:01:09.930> cores<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.320> still<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.770> good

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
CP is but quad cores are still very good

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in the holiday it is about sixty dollars

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.260 
in the holiday it is about sixty dollars
versus<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> 70

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
versus the 70

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.030 
versus the 70
it<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.720> before<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.200> if<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it was before so if you do have the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800 
it was before so if you do have the
money<00:02:15.220> go<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:15.910> eight<00:02:16.060> gigabytes<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.570> RAM<00:02:16.780> I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
money go for eight gigabytes of RAM I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.690 
money go for eight gigabytes of RAM I
highly<00:02:17.230> recommend<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.770> but<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.190> four

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
highly recommend it but if not four

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.610 
highly recommend it but if not four
gigabytes<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.210> RAM<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.630> still<00:02:19.870> very<00:02:20.080> useable

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
gigabytes of RAM is still very useable

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
gigabytes of RAM is still very useable
it<00:02:20.770> still<00:02:21.070> can<00:02:21.280> run<00:02:21.430> every<00:02:21.820> game<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.780> know

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
it still can run every game you know

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
it still can run every game you know
fine<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.500> paired<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.250> other<00:02:24.550> high

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
fine if it's paired with other high

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.870 
fine if it's paired with other high
quality<00:02:25.240> parts<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.860> know<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.670> 4

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
quality parts and you know you know 4

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.670 
quality parts and you know you know 4
gigabytes<00:02:28.270> ram<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.690> only<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.080> stick<00:02:29.380> also

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
gigabytes ram it's only one stick also

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.830 
gigabytes ram it's only one stick also
so<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.010> do<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.210> future<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.630> can

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so if you do get in the future you can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.390 
so if you do get in the future you can
buy<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.020> second<00:02:32.470> stick<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.950> you'll<00:02:33.100> have<00:02:33.220> eight

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
buy a second stick and you'll have eight

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.860 
buy a second stick and you'll have eight
gigabytes<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.910> RAM<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.300> you'll<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.600> good<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
gigabytes of RAM and you'll be good to

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.170 
gigabytes of RAM and you'll be good to
go<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.290> that's<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.710> fairly<00:02:36.340> good<00:02:36.610> setup<00:02:36.970> right

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
go so that's a fairly good setup right

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
go so that's a fairly good setup right

mail-in rebate it normally retails for

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.480 
mail-in rebate it normally retails for
170<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.530> think<00:02:47.680> about<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.890> price<00:02:48.250> draw

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
170 so just think about that price draw

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.490 
170 so just think about that price draw
for<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> second<00:02:49.090> guys<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.900> great<00:02:50.050> graphics

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
for a second guys really great graphics

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.920 
for a second guys really great graphics
card<00:02:50.770> very<00:02:50.950> good<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.490> even<00:02:51.760> 1080p<00:02:52.300> gaming<00:02:52.330> if

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
card very good for even 1080p gaming if

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.990 
card very good for even 1080p gaming if
you<00:02:53.020> play<00:02:53.200> at<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> resolution<00:02:53.740> by<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.280> 1680<00:02:54.850> x

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
you play at a resolution by like 1680 x

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.090 
you play at a resolution by like 1680 x
1050<00:02:55.420> it'll<00:02:55.810> perform<00:02:55.990> even<00:02:56.590> better<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.920> think

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
1050 it'll perform even better I think

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.670 
1050 it'll perform even better I think
that's<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.700> resolution<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.560> 1750<00:02:59.560> is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
that's the resolution that the 1750 is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.370 
that's the resolution that the 1750 is
geared<00:02:59.920> towards<00:03:00.250> 1680<00:03:00.820> x<00:03:00.970> 1050<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:01.810> even<00:03:02.290> at

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
geared towards 1680 x 1050 but even at

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380 
geared towards 1680 x 1050 but even at
1080p<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.070> can<00:03:03.310> run<00:03:03.550> most<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> titles

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
1080p you can run most of the titles

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.330 
1080p you can run most of the titles
today<00:03:04.510> at<00:03:04.810> medium<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.560> high<00:03:05.680> setting<00:03:06.160> so
