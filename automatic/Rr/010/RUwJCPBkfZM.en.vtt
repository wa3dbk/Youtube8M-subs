00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.629

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.199

 description when they have downloaded 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.699
 they open it and this interface will come out 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.670

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.229

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.710
 put him 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.649
 droid 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.330
 as for example we are going to put trace 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.910
 and we're just going to do something here in 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.220
 create and we will leave here considered that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.770
 we are going to open there and with it we are going to 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.230
 get out this skin template that is like 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 a stick but I do not remember that it is a skin 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.880
 well and they only play when they want 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.410
 a face like for example we touch the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.990
 face and here they will leave different 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 types of colors can customize their 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.120
 colors as you see here a little clearer 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.360
 as you see today we are going to put them what 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.030
 we play like this in each and we are going to put here 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's play here as well as for example 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's a demonstration you can 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 do better and for example the color 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.700
 carnitas that shows us and I can not 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.770
 I can not get it here I'm going to touch the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.050
 color and I'll give you here in color itch 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.790
 and I'm going to select the color that admits 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.440
 each number is going to put there cash 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.880
 this option and I'm already starting to paint another 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 time as you see is a very application 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.290
 effective very efficient as you come here to one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.870
 put a coffee to see where I can 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.880
 find I will see where you find 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 cancer here and here here 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.300
 and there they eat and we are going to put you here 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.040
 this effect that I put on my skin 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.620
 these to see as well as for example 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.500
 I do not put a super Sayayin over here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.960
 so like that so like that so like that so like that so like that 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.760
 well so that 's an example just 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.330
 you can make your skin like 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.010
 you want 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.240
 anyway the template leaves them 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 in the application and continue and if I want 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.520
 customize a skin that I already have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.130
 they just need to move it to their folder 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.830
 of downloads here says download and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.260
 as I have this 15 are goku is a 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.480
 skin that unloads of coconut and as they see 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.190
 just personalize the eyes as you see 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.380
 there you can put other colors that 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.210
 you want can download level 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.700
 of corner type and they put you in google 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.860
 download the skin that you want and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.110
 they will leave several and only what 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.580
 move in your downloads folder or I think 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.800
 obviously it will be downloaded to your 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.860
 Download folder and you're done 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.220
 how are they going to see there and only have 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.230
 to go to his make up and enter the menu 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.590
 of skin where he says customize touch 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.420
 there and select the file of your skin 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.850
