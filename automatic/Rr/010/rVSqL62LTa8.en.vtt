bring the sections forward then you're
going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.660> go<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.900> quite<00:02:06.290> small<00:02:06.680> sections<00:02:07.190> so

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
going to go in quite small sections so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.110 
going to go in quite small sections so
I'll<00:02:07.580> split<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.030> into<00:02:08.270> three<00:02:09.910> then<00:02:10.910> with

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
I'll split that into three then with

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.630 
I'll split that into three then with
your<00:02:11.270> tall<00:02:11.540> you're<00:02:11.870> gonna<00:02:11.990> hold<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.190> end<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
your tall you're gonna hold the end of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.560 
your tall you're gonna hold the end of
this<00:02:13.790> piece<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.790> then<00:02:16.790> you're<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.330> wrap

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
this piece and then you're going to wrap

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.070 
this piece and then you're going to wrap
around<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.430> middle<00:02:19.730> section<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
around just that middle section so you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.960 
around just that middle section so you
leave<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> end<00:02:21.530> quite<00:02:21.920> straight<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
leave the end quite straight and you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.729 
leave the end quite straight and you
leave<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.330> top<00:02:23.570> quite<00:02:23.870> straight<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.620> they

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
leave the top quite straight so they

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.090 
leave the top quite straight so they
were<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:25.040> king<00:02:25.370> from<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.760> middle<00:02:25.910> piece

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
were just king from that middle piece

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.979 
were just king from that middle piece

gentle way don't do anything to the wave

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.039 
gentle way don't do anything to the wave
yet<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.430> kind<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.700> brush<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.269> back<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.959> it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
then leave to cool and then I'm going to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.309 
then leave to cool and then I'm going to
make<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.480> basic<00:03:17.900> being<00:03:18.079> you're<00:03:18.200> going

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
make this the basic being you're going

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:33.820 
make this the basic being you're going
to<00:03:18.379> repeat<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.680> throughout<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.190> whole<00:03:19.400> head

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.970 

we've<00:03:34.830> done<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.099> bottom<00:03:35.459> section<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.060> then

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
we've done that bottom section and then

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
we've done that bottom section and then
you're<00:03:37.980> gonna<00:03:38.099> let<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.459> topic<00:03:38.909> come<00:03:39.209> down

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
you're gonna let this topic come down

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.449 
you're gonna let this topic come down
loose<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.830> how<00:03:40.980> many<00:03:41.129> sections

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
loose it's up to you how many sections

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.009 
loose it's up to you how many sections
you<00:03:41.640> want<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.849> do<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.209> I've<00:03:42.569> been<00:03:42.840> doing

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
you want to do it in I've been doing

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.809 
you want to do it in I've been doing
bottom<00:03:43.349> half<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> top<00:03:43.890> parts<00:03:44.190> probably<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
bottom half the top parts probably the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.399 
bottom half the top parts probably the
most<00:03:44.970> easiest<00:03:45.329> method<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.959> then<00:03:46.049> splitting

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
most easiest method and then splitting

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.890 
most easiest method and then splitting
into<00:03:46.620> two<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.129> you<00:03:47.220> could<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.489> each<00:03:47.610> side<00:03:47.900> but

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
into two so you could do each side but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.600 
into two so you could do each side but
if<00:03:49.019> you're<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.980> find<00:03:50.190> you've<00:03:50.310> got<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> lot

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
if you're if you find you've got a lot

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.369 
if you're if you find you've got a lot
of<00:03:50.670> hair<00:03:50.879> in<00:03:50.909> your<00:03:51.150> top<00:03:51.299> section<00:03:51.659> just<00:03:51.840> try<00:03:52.230> and

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
of hair in your top section just try and

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.770 
of hair in your top section just try and
still<00:03:52.590> keep<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.980> sections<00:03:53.250> small<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.690> you

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
still keep the sections small that you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.690 
still keep the sections small that you
Tong<00:03:55.170> otherwise<00:03:55.709> you're<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.069> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> find

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
Tong otherwise you're just going to find

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:39.060 
Tong otherwise you're just going to find
it<00:03:56.790> goes<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.060> early

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.400 

so<00:04:40.070> I'm<00:04:40.190> on<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.400> my<00:04:40.430> last<00:04:40.759> piece<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:42.139> probably

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
so I'm on to my last piece you probably

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.070 
so I'm on to my last piece you probably
did<00:04:42.590> notice<00:04:43.009> but<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:44.030> clarify<00:04:44.539> it<00:04:44.870> you're
