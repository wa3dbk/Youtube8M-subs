you<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.519> think<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:02.970> decision<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.510> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you know I think the decision here is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.250 
you know I think the decision here is
pretty<00:03:03.750> simple<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.379> she<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.769> not<00:03:05.010> terminated

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
well I guess there's probably that means

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.759 
well I guess there's probably that means
there's<00:03:09.150> lots<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.690> racism<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.500> school

be<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.180> or<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.329> other<00:03:33.359> right<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.200> know<00:03:34.319> it

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
be one or the other right you know it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.990 
be one or the other right you know it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
certainly could be a combination in fact

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.569 
certainly could be a combination in fact
as<00:03:36.209> with<00:03:36.720> most<00:03:36.930> things<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> combination

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
as with most things it is a combination

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.629 
as with most things it is a combination
of<00:03:38.730> both<00:03:39.030> nature<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.660> nurture<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> know

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
of both nature and nurture so you know

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.479 
of both nature and nurture so you know
the<00:03:41.910> entire<00:03:42.319> context<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.889> she<00:03:44.459> was

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489
