00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.359
 we put dough and cut now 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.030
 the dough in two stories that we are the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 size of a cookie and you're going to do 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.780
 then lines that represent the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 size of the cookies and once that's done 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.630
 we will put them in the oven at 180 Â° 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.119
 twelve to fifteen minutes for the recipe 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 caramel you will need 50 grams of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.460
 more cause or funds of which with 10 g 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.270
 liquid 130 g sugar a spoon 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.159
 butter soup and to finish the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 tweet you will need a tablet of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.409
 milk chocolate in a saucepan on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 will put the water as well as the fondant and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.310
 we will mix well then we will 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.869
 add the sugar but I'm thrown well 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.490
 once you have the beautiful has a beautiful 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.870
 color we will add the butter made 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.320
 Warning 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.570
 and you mix well and finish in 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.850
 adding the chalk badly we did 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.700
 watch out he may have small 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.440
 splash and you have to mix well 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.450
 and that's it, we're done 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.900
 to be able to pour this caramel on 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.050
 biscuits 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.370
 that's the result and biscuits so they 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.260
 are just perfect you can eat 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.730
 nature like that it's very good too 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.850
 we see tablecloth is now 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.070
 Gently caramel cookies 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.010
 so I advise you to start 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.180
 one end and put a little 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.250
 everywhere 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.470
 be careful caramel is very very 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.770
 hot and we'll spread all the caramel to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.180
 using a spoon and tells me that 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.070
 I advise you to do it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.350
 put it in the fridge for thirty 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.700
 minutes for the caramel to be 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.740
 taken well on the biscuit 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 I invite you to go also 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.510
 15 minutes in the freezer for either 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.610
 easier to work and then we 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.690
 just cut them out and 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.480
 put on a plate 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.550
 that's how came I 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.360
 not made all the tweets of course but 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.180
 it's to show you 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.580
 so you're going to slap 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.120
 chocolate so you go there delicately 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.970
 on the top here you put in 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.700
 good shape and for that to come down 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.110
 down and we do that for all 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.450
 tricks 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.550
 the result after half an hour 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.880
 in the fridge so here we have the tweet 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.080
 we will say original and that's my 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.080
 recipes so we see that it's very 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.750
 likenesses I invite you to do the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.390
 chocolate below as we did for 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.610
 the top and we will go directly to 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.269
 the tasting is gone for the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.250
 tasting 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.560
 so I'm going to take a tweak already I 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.260
 see if it opens like the others 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.110
 os x so here we have the good of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.519
 fondant caramel so it's rather not 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.620
 badly I'm pretty happy with the result 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.910
 we will have a beautiful color so these 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.930
 black parties 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.510
 frankly the recipe 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.390
 everything is there is this good side crispy 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.609
 of biscuit the caramel well melting and 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.379
