not tighten up to the glass so I'm going

more that's that you know that you got a

more that's that you know that you got a

vacuum on kind of a break because that

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.960 
vacuum on kind of a break because that

indicator right here that Red Lions

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.290 
indicator right here that Red Lions
honest<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.070> doesn't<00:04:30.250> rise<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.760> by<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.150> got

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
honest it doesn't rise up by it you got

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.940 
honest it doesn't rise up by it you got
a<00:04:31.330> real<00:04:31.510> good<00:04:31.690> back<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.140> held<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.440> position

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
a real good back and held in position

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.530 
a real good back and held in position
which<00:04:33.640> is<00:04:33.790> important<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:36.270> if<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.390> lose

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
which is important because if you lose

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.210 
which is important because if you lose
in<00:04:37.690> vacuum<00:04:38.110> you're<00:04:38.470> defeating<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.040> purpose

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
in vacuum you're defeating the purpose

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.640 
in vacuum you're defeating the purpose
of<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.580> tool<00:04:42.600> this<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.780> very<00:04:44.050> small<00:04:44.380> break

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
of the tool this is a very small break

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.130 
of the tool this is a very small break
so<00:04:45.040> that's<00:04:45.640> probably<00:04:45.880> enough<00:04:46.240> baking<00:04:46.930> time

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
so that's probably enough baking time

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.030 
so that's probably enough baking time
right<00:04:47.350> there<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:49.180> turn<00:04:49.390> pen<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.870> the

right there I just turn pen to the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
and turn the piston tuck a little bit of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.269 
and turn the piston tuck a little bit of
pressure<00:05:01.330> check<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.479> off<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.919> pressure<00:05:04.219> him
