what's up YouTube my name's Kenneth
today's<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.210> space<00:00:03.480> cubes<00:00:03.899> and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
today's video is on the space cubes and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.559 
today's video is on the space cubes and
I<00:00:04.170> got<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.560> made<00:00:04.830> from<00:00:05.400> v<00:00:05.520> cubes<00:00:05.819> calm<00:00:06.299> in

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I got these made from v cubes calm in

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.500 
I got these made from v cubes calm in
there<00:00:06.990> create<00:00:07.529> your<00:00:07.770> own<00:00:07.799> cube<00:00:08.519> section<00:00:09.389> on

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
there create your own cube section on

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.970 
there create your own cube section on
their<00:00:09.660> website<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.230> there<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.710> able<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
their website and there I was able to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.820 
their website and there I was able to
upload<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.460> own<00:00:11.639> images<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.530> create<00:00:13.530> these

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
upload my own images and create these

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.860 
upload my own images and create these
cubes<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.730> let<00:00:14.849> me<00:00:14.910> show<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.719> here

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
cubes so let me show them to you so here

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
cubes so let me show them to you so here
we<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.350> square<00:00:16.650> cubes<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.490> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
we have one of the square cubes and this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
we have one of the square cubes and this
of<00:00:18.240> course<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> 2x2<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.650> each<00:00:19.949> side<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
of course is a 2x2 and on each side I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 
of course is a 2x2 and on each side I
got<00:00:20.580> printed<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:21.150> image<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> night<00:00:22.439> sky

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
got printed an image of the night sky

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.550 
got printed an image of the night sky
that<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.670> took<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> most<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.199> from

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
that I took and most of them are from

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
that I took and most of them are from
the<00:00:25.619> ancient<00:00:26.130> Bristlecone<00:00:26.310> pine<00:00:26.910> forest<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the ancient Bristlecone pine forest and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
the ancient Bristlecone pine forest and
so<00:00:28.289> these<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> oldest<00:00:29.640> trees<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
so these are the oldest trees in the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.749 
so these are the oldest trees in the
world<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> Milky<00:00:32.640> Way

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
world and you can see the Milky Way

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.440 
world and you can see the Milky Way
behind<00:00:33.149> them<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.450> shooting

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
behind them and here we have a shooting

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.619 
behind them and here we have a shooting
star<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> Perseid<00:00:37.620> shooting<00:00:38.340> star<00:00:38.969> here

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
star that's a Perseid shooting star here

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.970 
star that's a Perseid shooting star here
we<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.809> another<00:00:39.960> Bristlecone<00:00:40.530> pine<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we have another Bristlecone pine in the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
we have another Bristlecone pine in the
Milky<00:00:41.309> Way<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.390> Milky<00:00:42.690> Way<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Milky Way and the Milky Way here and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.250 
Milky Way and the Milky Way here and
this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:43.890> taken<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> Mono<00:00:44.940> Lake<00:00:45.260> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this is actually taken in Mono Lake and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
this is actually taken in Mono Lake and
then<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> top<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.250> figured<00:00:47.760> since<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.629> feel

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
then at the top I figured since you feel

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
then at the top I figured since you feel
like<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> ground<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> down<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.760> top

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
like the ground is down here the top

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
like the ground is down here the top
needed<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.809> sky<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.829> have

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
needed to be all sky and so I just have

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
needed to be all sky and so I just have
some<00:00:53.070> Milky<00:00:53.640> Way<00:00:53.789> across<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> top<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> then

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
some Milky Way across the top and then

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
some Milky Way across the top and then
on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> bottom<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.160> chose<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.789> very<00:00:56.969> kind<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
on the bottom I chose a very kind of

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
on the bottom I chose a very kind of
bizarre<00:00:57.870> image<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.410> took<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.859> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
bizarre image that I took and it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.670 
bizarre image that I took and it's
actually<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> full<00:01:00.000> 360-degree<00:01:00.960> image<00:01:01.410> like

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
actually a full 360-degree image like

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
actually a full 360-degree image like
spherical<00:01:02.219> image<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.670> been<00:01:02.789> mapped<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
spherical image that's been mapped on to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
spherical image that's been mapped on to
a<00:01:03.750> flat<00:01:04.049> surface<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.220> everywhere<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
a flat surface and so everywhere you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.929 
a flat surface and so everywhere you
look<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> horizon<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
look is kind of horizon and this is the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
look is kind of horizon and this is the
entire<00:01:09.210> night<00:01:09.540> sky<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.380> Milky<00:01:10.650> Way<00:01:10.770> goes

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
entire night sky and the Milky Way goes

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
entire night sky and the Milky Way goes
across<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.790> crease<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.630> too<00:01:12.780> bad

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
across the crease which was too bad

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
across the crease which was too bad
because<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> hides<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> Milky<00:01:14.400> Way<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
because it kind of hides the Milky Way I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
because it kind of hides the Milky Way I
should<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.909> made<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> went<00:01:15.930> across

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
should have made it so it went across

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
should have made it so it went across
kind<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> had<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> diagonal<00:01:18.180> or

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
kind of you know I had a diagonal or

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
kind of you know I had a diagonal or
something<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
something like that but this is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
something like that but this is
basically<00:01:20.490> no<00:01:21.090> matter<00:01:21.180> where<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> look<00:01:21.659> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
basically no matter where you look it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
basically no matter where you look it's
horizon<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> entire<00:01:23.580> sky<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
horizon and that's the entire sky and so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
horizon and that's the entire sky and so
I<00:01:24.659> figured<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> fun<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I figured that was kind of a fun way to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
I figured that was kind of a fun way to
map<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.659> ground<00:01:27.930> ground

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
map it because we have ground ground

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
map it because we have ground ground
ground<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.670> ground<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
ground and so here we have ground on the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.560 
ground and so here we have ground on the
corners<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.810> well<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.740> anyway<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> chose<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.479> do

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
corners as well so anyway I chose to do

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
corners as well so anyway I chose to do
almost<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> exact<00:01:34.259> same<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> 3x3<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.000> did

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
almost the exact same for the 3x3 I did

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
almost the exact same for the 3x3 I did
switch<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> couple<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> images<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
switch out a couple of the images I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
switch out a couple of the images I
think<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.939> image<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
think it was this image here so this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
think it was this image here so this
image<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.579> believe<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.570> image<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.970> are

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
image and I believe this image I are

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
image and I believe this image I are
unique<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> these<00:01:45.930> puzzels<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
unique to these puzzels but all the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380 
unique to these puzzels but all the
other<00:01:47.159> images<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
other images are the same so we have

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.200 
other images are the same so we have
Mono<00:01:48.570> Lake<00:01:49.100> Bristlecone<00:01:50.100> pine<00:01:50.340> Bristlecone

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
Mono Lake Bristlecone pine Bristlecone

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050 
Mono Lake Bristlecone pine Bristlecone
pine<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> shooting<00:01:52.259> star<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.939> Milky<00:01:53.939> Way

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
pine with a shooting star and Milky Way

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
pine with a shooting star and Milky Way
at<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> top<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> see

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
at the top and then here you can see

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
at the top and then here you can see
them<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.759> Milky<00:01:57.090> Way<00:01:57.270> across<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.990> center

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
them the Milky Way across the center

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.219 
them the Milky Way across the center
down<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> 3x3<00:02:00.390> what's<00:02:00.780> fun<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
down here and with the 3x3 what's fun of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
down here and with the 3x3 what's fun of
course<00:02:01.500> these<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.310> pitcher<00:02:02.729> cubes<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
course these are pitcher cubes and so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
course these are pitcher cubes and so
you<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.049> deal<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you have to really deal with the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
you have to really deal with the
orientation<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> centers<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
orientation of the centers and so it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.270 
orientation of the centers and so it
makes<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.399> harder<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.450> solve<00:02:09.720> because

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
makes it a lot harder to solve because

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.130 
makes it a lot harder to solve because
you<00:02:11.280> know<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> regular<00:02:11.730> 3x3<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.810> would<00:02:12.989> be

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you know on a regular 3x3 this would be

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know on a regular 3x3 this would be
solved

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
solved

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.160 
solved
right<00:02:13.739> now<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.459> obviously<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> picture

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
right now but obviously on a picture

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
right now but obviously on a picture
cube<00:02:16.439> or<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> super<00:02:17.010> cube<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:17.610> solved

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
cube or a super cube it's not solved

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.670 
cube or a super cube it's not solved
because<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.510> center<00:02:18.840> needs<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.230> twisted

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
because the center needs to be twisted

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.080 
because the center needs to be twisted
and<00:02:19.890> same<00:02:20.459> with<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.790> one

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and same with this one

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.690 
and same with this one
and<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.079> makes<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.860> puzzle<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.579> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and so it makes the the puzzle of just a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.869 
and so it makes the the puzzle of just a
little<00:02:23.939> bit<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.209> challenging<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.310> think

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
little bit more challenging and I think

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.699 
little bit more challenging and I think
it<00:02:26.970> makes<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> more<00:02:27.299> fun<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.230> anyway<00:02:28.560> these

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it makes it more fun and so anyway these

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.490 
it makes it more fun and so anyway these
puzzles<00:02:29.099> are<00:02:29.189> very<00:02:29.700> difficult<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.269> solve<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
puzzles are very difficult to solve and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.080 
puzzles are very difficult to solve and
part<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.159> reason<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.519> because<00:02:32.549> some<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
part of the reason is because some of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.330 
part of the reason is because some of
all<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> pieces<00:02:33.569> look<00:02:33.870> very<00:02:34.200> similar<00:02:34.829> if<00:02:35.250> you

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
all the pieces look very similar if you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.460 
all the pieces look very similar if you
look<00:02:35.519> up<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.060> these<00:02:36.510> two<00:02:36.810> corners<00:02:37.140> they

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
look up here like these two corners they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.520 
look up here like these two corners they
look<00:02:37.739> identical<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.379> know

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
look identical and you have to you know

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.289 
look identical and you have to you know
make<00:02:41.040> sure<00:02:41.069> they're<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.700> place<00:02:41.849> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
make sure they're in the right place and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.539 
make sure they're in the right place and
oriented<00:02:42.720> correctly<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:44.159> know<00:02:44.280> from

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
oriented correctly and you know from

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.729 
oriented correctly and you know from
this<00:02:44.790> side<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.569> side<00:02:45.629> there's<00:02:46.079> not<00:02:46.349> much

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
this side and this side there's not much

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.860 
this side and this side there's not much
different<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.459> they're<00:02:47.609> very<00:02:47.760> dark<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
different and they're very dark and it's

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.509 
different and they're very dark and it's
hard<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.109> see<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.340> very

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
hard to see and so it's a very

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.460 
hard to see and so it's a very
challenging<00:02:50.609> dissolve<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.959> anyway<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
challenging dissolve so anyway this is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.229 
challenging dissolve so anyway this is
the<00:02:52.620> other<00:02:52.859> square<00:02:53.250> cube<00:02:53.489> here<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.819> one<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the other square cube here is one of the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.720 
the other square cube here is one of the
pillowed<00:02:54.540> cubes<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.190> pillow<00:02:56.370> cubes

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
pillowed cubes and on the pillow cubes

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.000 
pillowed cubes and on the pillow cubes
that<00:02:56.849> tried<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.420> something<00:02:57.629> different

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that tried to do something different

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.369 
that tried to do something different
instead<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.159> using<00:02:59.340> six<00:02:59.819> images<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.359> used<00:03:00.870> three

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
instead of using six images I used three

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.550 
instead of using six images I used three
panorama<00:03:02.099> images<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:04.409> they're

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
panorama images and so because they're

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.229 
panorama images and so because they're
kind<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.829> pillowed<00:03:05.159> here<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.730> has<00:03:05.879> full

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
kind of pillowed here and it has full

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
kind of pillowed here and it has full
edge<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> edge<00:03:06.780> printing<00:03:07.349> we<00:03:07.920> have<00:03:08.099> one<00:03:08.400> long

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
edge to edge printing we have one long

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.319 
edge to edge printing we have one long
image<00:03:09.209> across<00:03:09.769> both<00:03:10.769> sides<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.549> here<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.150> have

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
image across both sides and here we have

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.050 
image across both sides and here we have
an<00:03:12.480> ancient<00:03:12.780> Bristlecone<00:03:12.930> pine<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.400> bunch

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
an ancient Bristlecone pine with a bunch

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.610 
an ancient Bristlecone pine with a bunch
of<00:03:15.150> shooting<00:03:15.450> stars<00:03:15.750> from<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.200> Perseid

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
of shooting stars from the Perseid

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.159 
of shooting stars from the Perseid
meteor<00:03:16.980> shower<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.569> we<00:03:18.840> look<00:03:19.019> over

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
meteor shower and then if we look over

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.580 
meteor shower and then if we look over
here<00:03:19.549> we<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.669> a<00:03:20.699> panorama<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.989> Milky<00:03:22.470> Way

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
here we have a panorama of the Milky Way

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.939 
here we have a panorama of the Milky Way
kind<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.129> as<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.639> rainbow<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:25.079> we<00:03:25.500> have<00:03:25.650> another

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
kind of as a rainbow and we have another

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.369 
kind of as a rainbow and we have another
Bristlecone<00:03:26.549> pine<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.299> here<00:03:28.049> we<00:03:28.199> have

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
Bristlecone pine there and here we have

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.250 
Bristlecone pine there and here we have
a<00:03:28.410> third<00:03:28.799> Bristlecone<00:03:29.400> pine<00:03:29.669> with<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.870> Milky

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
a third Bristlecone pine with the Milky

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.220 
a third Bristlecone pine with the Milky
Way<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.099> only<00:03:32.819> three<00:03:33.209> images<00:03:33.659> on<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:34.049> but

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
Way and so only three images on here but

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.960 
Way and so only three images on here but
they<00:03:34.379> kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.739> span<00:03:34.980> across<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.849> actually

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
they kind of span across and it actually

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.640 
they kind of span across and it actually
makes<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.389> puzzle<00:03:36.659> even<00:03:36.989> harder<00:03:37.290> because

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
makes a puzzle even harder because

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.000 
makes a puzzle even harder because
there's<00:03:38.639> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.569> sky<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.590> makes<00:03:40.829> it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
there's kind of more sky and it makes it

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.339 
there's kind of more sky and it makes it
so<00:03:41.159> all<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.489> pieces<00:03:41.790> look<00:03:42.120> very<00:03:42.359> similar<00:03:42.840> and

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
so all the pieces look very similar and

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.680 
so all the pieces look very similar and
it's<00:03:43.979> I'm<00:03:44.220> not<00:03:44.280> gonna<00:03:44.519> lie<00:03:44.639> it's<00:03:44.790> hard<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
it's I'm not gonna lie it's hard it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.089 
it's I'm not gonna lie it's hard it
takes<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.989> very<00:03:46.139> long<00:03:46.260> time<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.709> solve<00:03:46.889> these

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
takes a very long time to solve these

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.990 
takes a very long time to solve these
things<00:03:47.389> so<00:03:48.389> anyway<00:03:48.629> that's<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
things so anyway that's the this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.369 
things so anyway that's the this
pillowed<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.359> then<00:03:51.479> we<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.139> last

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
pillowed one and then we have the last

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.159 
pillowed one and then we have the last
pillow<00:03:53.010> 2x2<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.909> it's<00:03:54.359> actually<00:03:54.720> identical

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
pillow 2x2 and it's actually identical

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.339 
pillow 2x2 and it's actually identical
to<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.190> 3x3<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.970> have<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> three<00:03:57.599> exact<00:03:58.109> same

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
to the 3x3 we have the three exact same

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.250 
to the 3x3 we have the three exact same
images<00:03:58.979> and<00:03:59.879> they<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.449> think<00:04:00.599> turned<00:04:01.079> out

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
images and they I think turned out

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.009 
images and they I think turned out
pretty<00:04:01.440> well<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.970> was<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.479> little<00:04:03.900> bit

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
pretty well so I was a little bit

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.349 
pretty well so I was a little bit
disappointed<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.709> these<00:04:04.859> because<00:04:05.370> first

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
disappointed with these because first

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.469 
disappointed with these because first
off<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.349> didn't<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.799> a<00:04:08.190> option<00:04:09.180> for

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
off the they didn't have a option for

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.689 
off the they didn't have a option for
the<00:04:09.629> inside<00:04:10.169> of<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.440> puzzle<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:10.949> so<00:04:11.340> all<00:04:11.519> the

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
the inside of the puzzle and so all the

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.909 
the inside of the puzzle and so all the
insides<00:04:12.120> are<00:04:12.419> white<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.989> they<00:04:13.440> kind<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.769> are

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
insides are white and they kind of are

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.939 
insides are white and they kind of are
very<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.669> think<00:04:15.359> kind<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.870> harsh<00:04:16.169> against<00:04:16.590> these

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
very I think kind of harsh against these

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.279 
very I think kind of harsh against these
dark<00:04:17.250> puzzles<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:19.079> it's

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
dark puzzles and so you can see it's

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.219 
dark puzzles and so you can see it's
white<00:04:19.650> right<00:04:19.709> here<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:21.239> that's<00:04:21.690> how<00:04:21.840> they<00:04:22.049> all

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
white right here and that's how they all

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.159 
white right here and that's how they all
are<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.580> can<00:04:23.700> see<00:04:23.849> on<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> 3x3<00:04:24.479> but<00:04:25.020> that

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
are and you can see on the 3x3 but that

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:25.770 
are and you can see on the 3x3 but that
kind<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.409> looks

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
kind of looks

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.690 
kind of looks
mid-turn<00:04:26.290> so<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.860> was<00:04:27.040> love<00:04:27.190> disappointed<00:04:27.640> you

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
mid-turn so I was love disappointed you

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.670 
mid-turn so I was love disappointed you
couldn't<00:04:27.820> choose<00:04:28.210> like<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.690> black<00:04:28.990> blank

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
couldn't choose like a black blank

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.790 
couldn't choose like a black blank
puzzle<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:30.580> build<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.090> off<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.390> that

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
puzzle and then build it off of that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.050 
puzzle and then build it off of that
instead<00:04:32.800> they're<00:04:33.040> all<00:04:33.220> white<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> inside

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
instead they're all white on the inside

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.320 
instead they're all white on the inside
but<00:04:34.870> besides<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.610> printing<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.090> pretty

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
but besides that the printing is pretty

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.510 
but besides that the printing is pretty
high-quality<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.740> really<00:04:39.010> like<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.370> edge

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
high-quality and I really like the edge

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.090 
high-quality and I really like the edge
to<00:04:39.760> edge<00:04:39.880> printing<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:41.140> think<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.470> turned

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
to edge printing and I think it turned

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.160 
to edge printing and I think it turned
out<00:04:42.280> pretty<00:04:42.340> good<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:42.940> anyway<00:04:43.420> I<00:04:43.450> hope<00:04:44.020> you

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
out pretty good so anyway I hope you

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.700 
out pretty good so anyway I hope you
