00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
so this is basically my map from idea to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.829 
so this is basically my map from idea to
actual<00:00:04.850> specific<00:00:05.850> style<00:00:06.120> lines<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.690> now<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and then the pockets right that's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.930 
and then the pockets right that's
getting<00:00:46.770> confusing<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.700> add

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
getting confusing over there so add

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
getting confusing over there so add
write<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.260> write<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.879> I'm<00:00:50.879> gonna

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
write you can write over here I'm gonna

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.750 
write you can write over here I'm gonna
say<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.390> wrap<00:00:51.600> around<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.410> sides<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:55.760> then

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
say they wrap around the sides and then

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.299 
say they wrap around the sides and then
I'm<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.010> has<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I'm also going to say that this has to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'm also going to say that this has to
be<00:00:59.430> interfaced<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:01.550> interfacing<00:01:02.550> which

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
be interfaced with interfacing which

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.450 
be interfaced with interfacing which
kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> structures<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> fabric<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.250> get

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of structures the fabric so we get

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.620 
kind of structures the fabric so we get
more<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:07.760> structure<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.420> add

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
more of a structure you know just add

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
more of a structure you know just add
structure<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.530> thin<00:01:11.040> silk<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.580> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
structure to your thin silk because we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
structure to your thin silk because we
want<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:16.020> supple<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
want this to be you know supple but the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.410 
want this to be you know supple but the
pockets<00:01:17.220> need<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.000> structure

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pockets need a little more structure

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060 
pockets need a little more structure
because<00:01:18.570> they're<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:18.840> tailored<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> then

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
because they're more tailored and then

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.480 
because they're more tailored and then
overall<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:23.250> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
overall what I really think is that this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.410 
overall what I really think is that this
should<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:24.020> cut<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> bias<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.430> cutting<00:01:27.330> on

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
should be cut on the bias and cutting on

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
should be cut on the bias and cutting on
the<00:01:27.540> bias<00:01:27.570> means<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> have

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the bias means that you know if you have

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.830 
the bias means that you know if you have
a<00:01:29.790> piece<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> silk<00:01:30.390> here

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
a piece of silk here

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
a piece of silk here
you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.110> here's<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.530> silk<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.040> want

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you know here's your silk and you want

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.319 
you know here's your silk and you want
to<00:01:32.250> cut<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> dress<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:35.119> it'll<00:01:36.119> hang

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to cut the dress out here it'll hang

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.719 
to cut the dress out here it'll hang
straight<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
straight but actually it's going to have

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
straight but actually it's going to have
some<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> fabric<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.840> some

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
some the fabric is gonna have some

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.679 
some the fabric is gonna have some
stretch<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> hang<00:01:41.070> better<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.790> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
stretch it's going to hang better if we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
stretch it's going to hang better if we
go<00:01:42.960> ahead<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.590> place<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.759> pattern<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.860> way

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
go ahead and place the pattern this way

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.130 
go ahead and place the pattern this way
this<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> how<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> dresses<00:01:49.020> were

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
this is kind of how all the dresses were

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.399 
this is kind of how all the dresses were
built<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> 40s<00:01:50.729> when<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.720> drape

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
built in like the 40s when they drape

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.990 
built in like the 40s when they drape
really<00:01:52.710> beautifully<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.880> all

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
really beautifully and they they all

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
really beautifully and they they all
hang<00:01:54.299> down<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.590> need<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> zipper

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
hang down it and you don't need a zipper

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
hang down it and you don't need a zipper
because<00:01:56.310> it'll<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.790> stretchy<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
because it'll be stretchy because the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.490 
because it'll be stretchy because the
fabric<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.969> woven<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fabric is going to be woven this way and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
fabric is going to be woven this way and
it's<00:02:01.619> gonna<00:02:01.740> stretch<00:02:02.189> rather<00:02:02.579> than<00:02:02.850> being<00:02:03.119> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it's gonna stretch rather than being you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
it's gonna stretch rather than being you
know<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
know up and down we want to go for this

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.479 
know up and down we want to go for this
where<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.469> where<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
where it's where it's you know that

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.250 
where it's where it's you know that
intersection

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
intersection

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.899 
intersection
so<00:02:12.319> I'm<00:02:12.470> gonna<00:02:12.590> put<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.830> note<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.189> says<00:02:13.400> cut<00:02:13.730> on

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
so I'm gonna put a note that says cut on

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.300 
so I'm gonna put a note that says cut on
the<00:02:14.030> bias<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> remember<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.189> that's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
the bias just so I remember that that's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030 
the bias just so I remember that that's
how<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.549> want<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.939> construct<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.739> there<00:02:18.920> we

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
how I want to construct it and there we

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.339 
how I want to construct it and there we
go<00:02:19.189> now<00:02:19.790> you're<00:02:20.060> ready<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.599> take<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
go now you're ready to take it to the

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.909 
go now you're ready to take it to the
workroom<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> turn<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.220> into<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.519> pattern
