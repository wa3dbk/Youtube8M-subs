00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.750 

this<00:00:28.990> battery<00:00:29.440> here<00:00:29.650> let's<00:00:30.130> look<00:00:30.280> at<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.520> port

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
this battery here let's look at the port

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.950 
this battery here let's look at the port
one<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:32.800> tracks<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.400> cells

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one two tracks of cells

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.560 
one two tracks of cells
I'll<00:00:34.960> hook<00:00:35.170> up<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.770> port<00:00:36.190> three<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.760> four

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.010 

so<00:00:41.140> when<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.500> go<00:00:42.310> in<00:00:42.520> and<00:00:42.760> turn<00:00:43.060> on<00:00:43.210> pork<00:00:43.780> -<00:00:43.960> I'm

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
so when you go in and turn on pork - I'm

so when you go in and turn on pork - I'm
not<00:00:44.260> using<00:00:44.470> right<00:00:44.770> now<00:00:44.890> so<00:00:45.340> they'll<00:00:46.270> notice

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
not using right now so they'll notice

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.890 

there's<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.750> labor<00:00:59.140> balance<00:01:00.720> like<00:01:01.720> Oh

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
there's a labor balance like Oh

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.900 
there's a labor balance like Oh
discharge<00:01:03.120> lipo<00:01:04.120> storage<00:01:05.250> fast<00:01:06.250> charge<00:01:06.580> they

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
discharge lipo storage fast charge they

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
both like the charge back the lipo

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.050 
both like the charge back the lipo

I'll<00:05:40.270> go

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
I'll go

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.950 
I'll go
so<00:05:42.160> young

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.010

it's reading 17.5 for internally to the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.330 
it's reading 17.5 for internally to the
charger<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:52.030> will<00:05:52.240> read<00:05:52.419> in<00:05:52.830> 17.7<00:05:53.830> 3<00:05:54.100> at<00:05:54.220> the

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
output of the power supply so it's

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.240 
output of the power supply so it's
reasonable<00:05:58.210> there's<00:05:59.139> some<00:05:59.289> loss<00:05:59.500> to<00:05:59.800> go

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
reasonable there's some loss to go

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.499 
reasonable there's some loss to go

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
will pick the I'm swimming back on here

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.230 
will pick the I'm swimming back on here
if<00:06:09.430> I<00:06:09.639> go

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:24.220 

okay<00:06:16.240> labour<00:06:16.720> balance<00:06:17.139> man<00:06:17.460> so<00:06:18.460> yeah

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.350 

incorrect

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
incorrect

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.260 
incorrect
hit<00:06:26.900> enter<00:06:27.050> quickly<00:06:27.759> and<00:06:28.759> it<00:06:28.849> lets<00:06:29.030> you<00:06:29.150> adjust

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
hit enter quickly and it lets you adjust

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.540 
hit enter quickly and it lets you adjust
settings<00:06:29.750> so<00:06:30.169> this<00:06:30.439> is<00:06:30.590> your<00:06:30.740> charge<00:06:31.009> wait<00:06:31.310> in

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
settings so this is your charge wait in

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.330 
settings so this is your charge wait in
balance<00:06:32.210> mode<00:06:32.419> so<00:06:33.259> it<00:06:33.470> will<00:06:33.620> show<00:06:34.069> you<00:06:34.129> the

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
balance mode so it will show you the

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:46.180 
balance mode so it will show you the
range<00:06:34.610> here

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.270 

so<00:06:46.730> we<00:06:46.820> can<00:06:46.940> push<00:06:47.150> 10<00:06:47.480> in<00:06:47.690> in<00:06:48.080> balance<00:06:48.920> mode<00:06:49.130> if

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
so we can push 10 in in balance mode if

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.980 
so we can push 10 in in balance mode if
I<00:06:49.370> go<00:06:49.520> past<00:06:49.790> that<00:06:49.970> it<00:06:50.120> jumps<00:06:50.360> back<00:06:50.420> around<00:06:50.870> the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
I go past that it jumps back around the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.130 
I go past that it jumps back around the
point<00:06:51.290> 1<00:06:52.150> okay<00:06:53.150> so<00:06:53.210> we<00:06:53.360> can<00:06:53.480> choose<00:06:53.690> up<00:06:53.840> to<00:06:53.960> 10

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
point 1 okay so we can choose up to 10

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.640 
point 1 okay so we can choose up to 10
in<00:06:54.350> and<00:06:54.950> we<00:06:55.040> can<00:06:55.160> hit<00:06:55.250> any<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:57.050> now<00:06:57.200> you<00:06:57.260> see<00:06:57.530> it

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
in and we can hit any so now you see it

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.950 
in and we can hit any so now you see it
highlights<00:06:58.010> the<00:06:58.220> 2s

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
highlights the 2s

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.200 
highlights the 2s
now<00:06:59.960> we<00:07:00.080> cannot<00:07:00.290> get<00:07:00.500> the<00:07:00.620> 1s<00:07:01.010> it's<00:07:01.400> 2<00:07:01.640> s<00:07:01.820> or

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
now we cannot get the 1s it's 2 s or

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.960 
now we cannot get the 1s it's 2 s or
higher<00:07:02.590> and<00:07:03.590> basically<00:07:03.980> 3<00:07:04.460> 4<00:07:04.880> 5<00:07:05.390> 6<00:07:06.520> so<00:07:07.520> back<00:07:07.940> to

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
higher and basically 3 4 5 6 so back to

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.040 
higher and basically 3 4 5 6 so back to
2<00:07:08.530> whenever<00:07:09.530> you<00:07:09.740> get<00:07:09.860> to<00:07:09.980> that<00:07:10.130> what<00:07:10.340> you<00:07:10.490> need

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
2 whenever you get to that what you need

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.440 
2 whenever you get to that what you need
just<00:07:12.050> tap<00:07:12.260> enter<00:07:12.790> at<00:07:13.790> that<00:07:13.940> point<00:07:14.180> if<00:07:14.270> you<00:07:14.360> had

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
just tap enter at that point if you had

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.880 
just tap enter at that point if you had
a<00:07:14.480> battery<00:07:14.810> hooked<00:07:14.930> up<00:07:15.170> you<00:07:15.350> would<00:07:15.470> do<00:07:15.560> the<00:07:15.680> 3

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
a battery hooked up you would do the 3

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.670 
a battery hooked up you would do the 3
second<00:07:16.250> home<00:07:16.810> confirm<00:07:17.810> what<00:07:18.020> the<00:07:18.110> screen<00:07:18.380> says

second home confirm what the screen says

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.500 
second home confirm what the screen says
is<00:07:18.920> the<00:07:19.100> same<00:07:19.340> on<00:07:19.520> the<00:07:19.640> top<00:07:19.880> which<00:07:20.210> is<00:07:20.240> it

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.510 
is the same on the top which is it
