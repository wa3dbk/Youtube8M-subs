00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello everyone! I am the captain of the "SK-Gaming" team, Ocelot. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 We took the Kingston hacker (HyperX) to Dreamhack to participate in the LCS competition. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 The trip to Sweden is always so enjoyable, because the people and the audience here are always passionate about us. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 They always cheer for us, we really like this feeling. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 So far, we have made a second draw this season, we just want to improve the shortcomings of last season. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 In the next week, what we have to do is improve, improve, and improve so that we can reach the finals of the world. 0:00:34.000,0:00:10.000 I think our strongest opponent is Fnatic, and this season is the time to beat them. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Although they did not beat them this weekend, the next time, they will definitely make them fearful of us. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 The Kingston Hacker will launch the SteelSeries Siberia V2 release at Dreamhack. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 In fact, I have used this product myself, it is really great. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The sound quality of this headset is perfect and clear, you will find it is the best companion for game competition and listening to music; it is awesome. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Kingston hacker headphones are very comfortable and lightweight to wear, very suitable for listening to music, playing games, overall, is a very good headset. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Hacker products can improve PC performance, especially when playing games or competitions, and when there is a high demand for perfect and uninterrupted presentation of everything and smooth operation. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 I use it myself, I am sure that you will also be attracted to it. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 In order for eSports to flourish, we definitely need someone to invest a lot of energy in this area. Fortunately, Kingston hackers are ubiquitous and they are sponsors of Dreamhack. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 They have sponsored many teams around the world, which really helped a lot because they always allowed us to perform at their best. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 They are always caring for us and providing us with the highest quality, we are very satisfied. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Our team gathered at the hacker's booth and signed the fans. Everyone is very friendly to us. It is always pleasant to work with them. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Thanks to the hacker god for everything. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Participate in the hacker's booth at Dreamhack, and spend the days with hacker staff and fans. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
