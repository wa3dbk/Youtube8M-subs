next<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.020> increase<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.500> 18<00:00:01.920> to

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
next we're going to increase from 18 to

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.340 
next we're going to increase from 18 to
24<00:00:02.370> so<00:00:02.879> chain<00:00:03.149> 1<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.540> make<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.720> new<00:00:03.929> row

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
24 so chain 1 to make a new row

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.230 
24 so chain 1 to make a new row
now<00:00:05.040> you're<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.370> single<00:00:05.670> crochet<00:00:05.790> in

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
now you're going to single crochet in

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.890 
now you're going to single crochet in
the<00:00:06.359> next<00:00:06.390> two<00:00:06.750> holes

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.709 

then<00:00:10.860> increase<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.549> third<00:00:11.730> hole<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.539> make

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
then increase in the third hole so make

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.330 
then increase in the third hole so make
two<00:00:12.929> stitches<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.589> that<00:00:13.769> hole<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:16.340> you're

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
two stitches in that hole so you're

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.460 
two stitches in that hole so you're
going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.849> all<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.029> way<00:00:18.240> around

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
going to do that all the way around

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.240 
going to do that all the way around
single<00:00:19.470> crochet<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.279> holes<00:00:22.099> and<00:00:23.099> then

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
single crochet and two holes and then

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
single crochet and two holes and then
increase<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.820> every<00:00:24.090> third<00:00:24.329> hole<00:00:28.039> now<00:00:29.039> I've

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
increase in every third hole now I've

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.429 
increase in every third hole now I've
gotten<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> end<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> skip<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> stitch

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
gotten to the end and I skip that stitch

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
gotten to the end and I skip that stitch
slip<00:00:32.129> stitch<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.519> the<00:00:32.610> next<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.970> to<00:00:33.120> join<00:00:33.269> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
slip stitch on the next one to join the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.200 
slip stitch on the next one to join the
row<00:00:33.570> chain<00:00:33.920> one<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> start<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> new<00:00:35.519> row<00:00:35.699> now

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
row chain one to start a new row now

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.160 
row chain one to start a new row now
you're<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.690> another<00:00:36.900> row<00:00:37.110> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you're going to do another row of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.650 
you're going to do another row of
twenty-four<00:00:37.830> so<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> put<00:00:39.089> one<00:00:39.269> single

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
twenty-four so just put one single

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.219 
twenty-four so just put one single
crochet<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> each<00:00:40.440> hole<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.839> that<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
crochet and each hole so do that all the

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.619 
crochet and each hole so do that all the
way<00:00:43.350> around<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:44.159> you<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.309> 24<00:00:45.000> stitches<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
way around so you have 24 stitches and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.369 
way around so you have 24 stitches and
that<00:00:45.659> row<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:47.150> I've<00:00:48.150> gotten<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.659> end<00:00:48.690> skip

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that row and I've gotten to the end skip

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.960 
that row and I've gotten to the end skip
that<00:00:49.559> stitch<00:00:49.830> do<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> slip<00:00:50.309> stitch<00:00:50.519> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> next

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
that stitch do a slip stitch in the next

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.750 
that stitch do a slip stitch in the next
one<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.420> join<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.720> row<00:00:51.869> chain<00:00:52.610> one<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one to join the row chain one to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.219 
one to join the row chain one to
starting<00:00:54.089> your<00:00:54.119> row<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.689> the<00:00:54.900> last<00:00:54.930> row

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
starting your row and the last row

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.780 
starting your row and the last row
you're<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> decrease<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.519> you're

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
you're going to decrease and you're

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.689 
you're going to decrease and you're
going<00:00:56.939> to<00:00:56.970> do<00:00:57.119> everything<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.869> the<00:00:57.930> back<00:00:58.110> loop

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
going to do everything and the back loop

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.719 
going to do everything and the back loop
so<00:00:59.699> each<00:00:59.909> stitch<00:01:00.269> has<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.689> loops<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:02.400> is<00:01:02.610> the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
so each stitch has two loops this is the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.080 
so each stitch has two loops this is the
front<00:01:02.970> one<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.680> that's<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
front one and that's the back one so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.550 
front one and that's the back one so
going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> everything<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.290> loop

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
going to do everything in the back loop

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to do everything in the back loop
so<00:01:08.369> from<00:01:08.610> eighteen<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> twenty-four<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.869> did

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
so from eighteen to twenty-four we did

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.609 
so from eighteen to twenty-four we did
single<00:01:10.439> crochet<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.040> two<00:01:11.220> holes<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.470> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
single crochet in two holes and then we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
single crochet in two holes and then we
increased<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.280> third<00:01:14.490> hole<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> go

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
increased in the third hole so to go

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
increased in the third hole so to go
from<00:01:15.930> 24<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.440> 18<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.280> decrease<00:01:17.730> in<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.030> third

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
from 24 to 18 you decrease in the third

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280 
from 24 to 18 you decrease in the third
hole<00:01:18.420> instead<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> increasing

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.900 

so<00:01:24.290> go<00:01:24.530> through<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> back<00:01:25.040> loop<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.520> next

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
so go through the back loop of the next

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.680 
so go through the back loop of the next
two<00:01:26.060> stitches<00:01:27.850> yarn<00:01:28.850> over<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.300> pull<00:01:29.510> through

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
two stitches yarn over and pull through

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.190 
two stitches yarn over and pull through
those<00:01:30.050> two<00:01:30.260> loops<00:01:31.390> then<00:01:32.390> yarn<00:01:32.420> over<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.020> pull

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
those two loops then yarn over and pull

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.590 
those two loops then yarn over and pull
through<00:01:33.380> these<00:01:33.770> two<00:01:33.980> loops<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:35.360> you're<00:01:35.480> going

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
through these two loops so you're going

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.200 
through these two loops so you're going
to<00:01:35.660> do<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.900> same<00:01:36.110> thing<00:01:36.380> all<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> way<00:01:36.770> around

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
to do the same thing all the way around

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.710 
to do the same thing all the way around
single<00:01:38.210> crochet<00:01:38.600> through<00:01:38.840> two<00:01:39.050> holes<00:01:39.610> and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
single crochet through two holes and

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.930 
single crochet through two holes and
then<00:01:41.720> decrease<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:49.280> do<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.640> all<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.820> way

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
then decrease so do that all the way

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.850 
then decrease so do that all the way
around<00:01:50.090> doing<00:01:51.080> everything<00:01:51.229> on<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.740> back

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
around doing everything on the back

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.330 
around doing everything on the back
loops<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.119> I've<00:01:53.180> gone<00:01:53.360> all<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.690> way<00:01:53.720> around

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
loops so I've gone all the way around

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.530 
loops so I've gone all the way around
and<00:01:55.340> when<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.000> back<00:01:56.149> loop<00:01:56.360> you

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
and when you do it on the back loop you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.109 
and when you do it on the back loop you
see<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:56.930> line<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.070> started<00:01:58.460> here<00:01:58.729> that's

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
see this line so I started here that's

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.880 
see this line so I started here that's
the<00:01:59.330> end<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.229> there's<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.649> little

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the end and then there's this little

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.830 
the end and then there's this little
stitch<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.550> way<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.149> that's<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.540> chain

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
stitch in the way so that's that chain

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.990 
stitch in the way so that's that chain
