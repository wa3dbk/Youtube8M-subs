00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.850
 Hello friends with you when there is 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.850
 Today we will talk about such a technique as 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.400
 paladin is currently top 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.160
 art of the eighth level which is at 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.570
 supplier marat and shishkin paladin is 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 upgraded me-109 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.329
 which has 155 millimeters howitzer m 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.980
 284 l-39 when a little less than 16 seconds but 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.320
 at the expense of equipment when you can 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.080
 cut to 11 seconds and this is not considering 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.970
 Crew commander skills to me as a result of 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.620
 managed to shake by d to nine with 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.750
 half a second what's on my mind 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.580
 pretty quick from that high 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.440
 rate of fire and as a result 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.300
 opportunities and give a lot of damage each 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 fight well of course do not forget at the same time 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.590
 move otherwise you will become easy 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.659
 prey for enemy arty u paladin 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.210
 higher speed turning tower speed 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.610
 aiming than the same notch 2000 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 also this art has a large range of variation 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.869
 if you have to fight back in melee 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.850
 something like a duel we lose with a big 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.130
 a bit like a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.900
 we are not yes and the dimensions are large enough 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.450
 it won't make us big 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.460
 labor as you know the art shines after 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.800
 the third shot and we do not have a drum 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.870
 it means we have an advantage over 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.310
 artois loader cassettes from single 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.810
 shots on the map we glow 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.220
 fairly short time 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.410
 if you compare the same drums to you 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 for example wait for thousands in the set 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.610
 besides high-explosive and actively 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.070
 rockets has such projectiles 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 as smoke and lighting demagogues 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.790
 projectile and hide all allies in 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.160
 a radius of 30 meters to 20 you 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.130
 this time is enough to change 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.690
 position or regroup 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.520
 lighting shells the other way around 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.400
 a radius of 30 meters show all 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.410
 opponents for 10 seconds even 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.080
 after the general nerve nerve which touched 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.820
 and half he did not become worse for 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.260
 equipment expense among damages can 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.229
 keep high enough 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.100
 penetration damage can be from 600 to 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.620
 700 without breaking through from 100 to 500 but this 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.090
 all numbers in real game every shot 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.980
 deals approximately 350,450 strength points 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.910
 The art is not high precision as the same 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 Challenge 2000 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.360
 but they have a lot of bt 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.890
 throw a pleasure 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680
 especially for all sorts of someone to us 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 Challenger and other slow tank 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 swing your mouth anyway have to since 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.020
 it opens very useful equipment 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.920
 firepower such as a magnetic 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.110
 privat paladin 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.660
 and gyroscopic stabilizer and decrees 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 h2000 on this I hope everything 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.290
 the information was helpful to you with you 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.290
 There was a genze once for all bye
