00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the tip and tail and then 40% camber

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
the tip and tail and then 40% camber
under<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> tip<00:00:43.469> underfoot<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.270> lends

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
under the tip underfoot it kind of lends

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
under the tip underfoot it kind of lends
itself<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:46.829> versatile

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
itself to be actually a pretty versatile

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.270 
itself to be actually a pretty versatile
ski<00:00:47.610> doesn't<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.360> does<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.960> so

ski doesn't it it does you know so
basically<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.489> ski<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.730> designed<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
basically the ski is designed for the

the<00:01:01.050> mountain<00:01:01.230> okay<00:01:01.649> cool

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the mountain okay cool

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
the mountain okay cool
and<00:01:02.539> step-down<00:01:03.539> sidewall<00:01:04.049> which<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and step-down sidewall which is kind of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
and step-down sidewall which is kind of
you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.040> Atomics<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> way<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you know Atomics and you know way of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
you know Atomics and you know way of
making<00:01:07.200> skis<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.650> days<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.130> works<00:01:08.340> very

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
making skis these days which works very

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
making skis these days which works very
well<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.330> lightweight<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.170> offers

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
well because it's lightweight and offers

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
well because it's lightweight and offers
a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> control<00:01:11.610> stability<00:01:12.180> right<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> does

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a lot of control stability right it does

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.109 
a lot of control stability right it does
it<00:01:12.900> lends<00:01:13.650> itself<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.549> torsional

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it lends itself to a very torsional

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
it lends itself to a very torsional
rigidity<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:16.080> adds<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> control<00:01:17.189> okay

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
rigidity which adds to the control okay

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.929 
rigidity which adds to the control okay
and<00:01:18.290> wood<00:01:19.290> core<00:01:19.619> obviously<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> ski<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and wood core obviously in a ski of this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.560 
and wood core obviously in a ski of this
caliber

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
caliber

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
caliber
but<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.259> something<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> unique<00:01:23.189> with

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
but then something kind of unique with

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
but then something kind of unique with
the<00:01:23.729> sprocket<00:01:24.479> power<00:01:24.659> boosters<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the sprocket power boosters and in this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
the sprocket power boosters and in this
case<00:01:26.280> they're<00:01:26.490> carbons<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> ski<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
case they're carbons so the ski is a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.060 
case they're carbons so the ski is a
little<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.020> lively<00:01:28.500> compared<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
little more lively compared to the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670 
little more lively compared to the
automatic<00:01:29.610> absolutely<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> basically<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
automatic absolutely the basically the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.249 
automatic absolutely the basically the
carbon-fiber<00:01:32.220> sprocket<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.210> boosters<00:01:33.990> are

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
carbon-fiber sprocket power boosters are

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.399 
carbon-fiber sprocket power boosters are
inlaid<00:01:34.829> tip<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> tail<00:01:35.729> there's<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:37.290> on

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
inlaid tip and tail there's two one on

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
inlaid tip and tail there's two one on
each<00:01:37.590> side<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> edge<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> does<00:01:39.270> add

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
each side of the edge so that does add

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
each side of the edge so that does add
to<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.950> agility<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> ski<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.430> adds<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to the agility of the ski and adds to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
to the agility of the ski and adds to
the<00:01:42.090> pop<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> okay<00:01:43.170> cool<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.280> you're<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the pop of it okay cool so if you're a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.760 
the pop of it okay cool so if you're a
freestyle<00:01:45.060> big<00:01:45.390> mountain<00:01:45.689> ripper<00:01:45.899> definitely

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
freestyle big mountain ripper definitely

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
freestyle big mountain ripper definitely
