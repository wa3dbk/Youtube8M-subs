00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
for health care in this country and walk

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.710 
for health care in this country and walk
around<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.310> you'll<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.730> we're<00:03:06.570> not

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
around and you'll see that we're not

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320 
around and you'll see that we're not
quite<00:03:07.160> following<00:03:08.160> our<00:03:08.550> following<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.180> lead

quite following our following that lead

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.729 
quite following our following that lead
but<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.600> think<00:03:09.840> it's<00:03:09.959> important<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.440> people

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
but I think it's important that people

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.000 
but I think it's important that people
eat<00:03:11.190> healthier<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.630> very<00:03:12.930> expensive<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.770> part

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
eat healthier it's very expensive a part

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
eat healthier it's very expensive a part
of<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> problems<00:03:14.459> if<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.970> family

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
of the problems if you have a family

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.840 
of the problems if you have a family
people<00:03:16.020> think<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> agree<00:03:17.370> we'll<00:03:17.700> go

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
crazy on this for as anybody talking

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.530 
crazy on this for as anybody talking
about<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.459> been<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.360> a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
about it because I have been in a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.850 
about it because I have been in a
position<00:03:21.690> where<00:03:21.930> I've<00:03:22.140> been<00:03:22.440> almost<00:03:22.680> like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
position where I've been almost like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.800 
position where I've been almost like
dead<00:03:23.160> broke<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.430> had<00:03:23.760> no<00:03:23.970> money<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.420> I've

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
dead broke and had no money and I've

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.449 
dead broke and had no money and I've
been<00:03:24.959> able<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.290> eat<00:03:25.320> completely<00:03:25.980> clean<00:03:26.220> during

been able to eat completely clean during
that<00:03:26.700> time<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.209> think<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.750> feed<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> family

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
that time I think you can feed a family

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.990 
that time I think you can feed a family
completely<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.070> same<00:03:29.250> type<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.489> money<00:03:29.760> I

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
completely on that same type of money I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.640 
completely on that same type of money I
understand<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.720> 59<00:03:31.050> cents<00:03:31.260> maybe<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.560> get

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
understand it's 59 cents maybe to get

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.080 
understand it's 59 cents maybe to get
mcdonalds<00:03:32.160> or<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> burger<00:03:32.610> but<00:03:32.880> there<00:03:33.000> are

no there you carry the water with your
name<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.959> wasn't<00:04:19.170> like<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.470> flask

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
name it wasn't like that it's flask

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.040 
name it wasn't like that it's flask
shaped<00:04:20.010> yeah<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.550> is<00:04:20.670> very<00:04:20.910> nicest<00:04:21.209> future

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
shaped yeah that is very nicest future

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.600 
shaped yeah that is very nicest future
is<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.860> myth<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.400> more

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
is not it's a myth that it is more

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.310 
is not it's a myth that it is more
expensive<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.480> initially<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:25.020> might<00:04:25.170> be

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
expensive I think initially it might be

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.390 
expensive I think initially it might be
because<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.680> might<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.920> to<00:04:25.980> retrain

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
because you might have to retrain

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.130 
because you might have to retrain
yourself<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.880> how<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.060> prepare<00:04:27.420> meals<00:04:27.660> you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
yourself on how to prepare meals you

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.120 
yourself on how to prepare meals you
might<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.470> figure<00:04:28.590> out<00:04:28.680> how<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.890> get<00:04:29.010> your

juice<00:05:27.090> or<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.390> water<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.080> am<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:28.710> think<00:05:29.190> that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
juice or a water so I am I think that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.220 
juice or a water so I am I think that
argument<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.060> know<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.300> sounds<00:05:30.540> good<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.170> I

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
argument I know it sounds good and I

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.270 
argument I know it sounds good and I
know<00:05:31.290> people<00:05:31.500> are<00:05:31.650> gonna<00:05:31.710> get<00:05:31.890> pissed<00:05:32.100> in<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
know people are gonna get pissed in the

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.460 
know people are gonna get pissed in the
comments<00:05:32.700> but<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.110> argument

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
comments but it's I think that argument

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.530 
comments but it's I think that argument
sounds<00:05:34.710> better<00:05:35.130> than<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.580> actually<00:05:35.760> is<00:05:36.000> does

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
sounds better than it actually is does

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.540 
sounds better than it actually is does
that<00:05:36.750> does<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.020> jive<00:05:37.290> we<00:05:37.470> do<00:05:37.590> families<00:05:38.250> out

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
that does that jive we do families out

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.880 
that does that jive we do families out
there<00:05:38.580> with<00:05:39.060> five<00:05:39.360> kids<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.410> problem

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
there with five kids that have a problem

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
thinking if i had a family to support

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.390 
thinking if i had a family to support
how<00:05:45.960> would<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.140> do<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.740> there<00:05:46.890> needs<00:05:47.130> two

chocolate cake is made through chemicals

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.320 
chocolate cake is made through chemicals
I<00:06:20.130> think<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:20.610> make<00:06:20.760> chocolate<00:06:21.120> cake<00:06:21.300> with

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
I think if you make chocolate cake with

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.909 
I think if you make chocolate cake with
the<00:06:21.540> ingredients<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.169> initially<00:06:22.530> went<00:06:22.710> into

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
the ingredients and initially went into

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.500 
the ingredients and initially went into
making<00:06:23.070> a<00:06:23.310> chocolate<00:06:23.490> cake<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:24.330> would<00:06:24.450> have

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
making a chocolate cake you would have

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.700 
making a chocolate cake you would have
people<00:06:24.780> that<00:06:24.870> are<00:06:24.930> healthy<00:06:25.290> and<00:06:25.320> eating<00:06:25.530> a

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
people that are healthy and eating a

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.170
