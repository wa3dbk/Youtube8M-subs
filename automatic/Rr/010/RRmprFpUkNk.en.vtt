 Finance Tinners perception that would be 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.180
 the weather is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.640

 or did someone write that i could very quickly forget that was 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.960
 he certainly 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 Mr he or she said because of that one yes or was the conviction that that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.940

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.270
 but we have done that now 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.539
