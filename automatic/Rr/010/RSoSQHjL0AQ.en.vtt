00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.190
 20 superiority and 3 points that leave the 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.170
 Real Madrid closer to the second 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.240
 square in the league a fair victory and 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.099
 deserved that also prolongs the good 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.039
 streak in front of the mattresses but that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.490
 the team has clearly been superior in 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.200
 all the senses there is an aspect I 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 I think that very important has been built 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.120
 there are three forum from behind we have just 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.440
 granted no occasion and we have 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.380
 tapped 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.720
 the chances that wonderful frank of 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.660
 Christian has opened the game for us 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 from ozil's goal, I think that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.930
 we have felt very comfortable and 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.720
 we have been superior we have been able 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.820
 score more goals and in the end then I think 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.710
 that people have been happy so a 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.320
 very important victory to whom the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.600
 true whenever the team gets 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 ahead is difficult for the rival 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.860
 because it has to open a little bit the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.220
 spaces have to risk a little more 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.589
 and those plays against us because the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.360
 we handle them especially well we have 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.150
 very fast and very precise people in the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.800
 pass and today once has shown that no 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.110
 has finished in goal but it has been a 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.470
 of the best matches of the game for 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 we were a party 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.320
 a little special after having 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.340
 lost in seville 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.860
 well I think it has been very important 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.000
 the response of the team in all 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.909
 very concentrated senses very solid 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.909
 demonstrating 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.649
 we are going to go match by match 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.470
 hoping to cut that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.000
 disadvantage 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.530
 and see if little by little we're also going 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.550
 recovering all the injured is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.660
 say it 's a very long season and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.520
 now think about Tuesday's game 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.890
 that although we're classified we 're going 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.920
 here before our audience and we have to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.220
 of course give a good image and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.400
 then to continue advancing which is 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 Our objective is true that from time to time 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.100
 when the team can lose but 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.320
 when you think about the possibilities 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 of the team the venues are huge so 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.659
 so much one always has to be very 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.979
 optimistic when Real Madrid plays at 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.979
 less is the point of view
