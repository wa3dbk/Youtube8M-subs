judging by this drive so far it actually

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
seems to write better than the both of

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.970 
seems to write better than the both of
those<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.810> back-to-back<00:02:28.290> drive<00:02:28.590> would

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
those but a back-to-back drive would

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
those but a back-to-back drive would
probably<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> real<00:02:29.700> test<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
probably be the real test for that so it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930 
probably be the real test for that so it
handles<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.590> rides<00:02:34.860> well<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.760> even
