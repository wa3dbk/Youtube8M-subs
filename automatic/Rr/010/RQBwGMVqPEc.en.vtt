00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
shot we have to understand the role of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.140 
shot we have to understand the role of
the<00:00:22.320> defensive<00:00:22.890> player<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.850> let's<00:00:23.880> put

ourselves in the role the defensive
player<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> second<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
player for a second what do we want to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
do as a defender well we want to stay

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.859 
do as a defender well we want to stay
about<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.939> arm's<00:00:30.269> length<00:00:30.330> away<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.689> the

about an arm's length away from the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.170 
about an arm's length away from the
offensive<00:00:31.410> player<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.059> get

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
offensive player so that one we can get

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990 
offensive player so that one we can get
a<00:00:33.239> hand<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.750> any<00:00:33.960> shot<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.620> two<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.850> can

move<00:00:36.149> our<00:00:36.300> feet<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.960> stay<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.260> front<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
move our feet to stay in front of the

move our feet to stay in front of the
offensive<00:00:38.129> player<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.640> allow<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
offensive player and not allow them to

offensive player and not allow them to
get<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> rim<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> goal<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
get to the rim so if the goal of the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
get to the rim so if the goal of the
defense<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> keep<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> offensive<00:00:43.379> player

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
defense is to keep the offensive player

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.709 
defense is to keep the offensive player
an<00:00:43.680> arm's<00:00:44.010> length<00:00:44.070> away<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.730> an<00:00:45.390> offensive

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
an arm's length away as an offensive

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
an arm's length away as an offensive
player<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:46.860> allow<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> have

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
player we want to not allow them to have

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
player we want to not allow them to have
that<00:00:47.730> advantage<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.200> need<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that advantage so what we need to do in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.520 
that advantage so what we need to do in
order<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> create<00:00:50.579> space<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:52.020> close<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
order to create space is to close the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.180 
order to create space is to close the
space<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.629> when<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.989> create<00:00:55.320> space<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
space so when we create space we need to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
space so when we create space we need to
close<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> gap<00:00:56.699> by<00:00:57.239> closing<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> gap<00:00:58.170> what

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
close the gap by closing the gap what

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
close the gap by closing the gap what
we're<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.739> doing<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.520> causing<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
we're actually doing is causing the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.630 
we're actually doing is causing the
defender<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> adjust<00:01:01.559> their<00:01:01.770> stance<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.460> order

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
defender to adjust their stance in order

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
defender to adjust their stance in order
to<00:01:02.730> stay<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.000> front<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> us<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:04.260> right

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to stay in front of us if we're right

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
to stay in front of us if we're right
next<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> defensive<00:01:05.640> player<00:01:05.850> what

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
next to the defensive player what

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
next to the defensive player what
happens<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.470> easily<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.920> around

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
happens is is we can easily get around

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000 
happens is is we can easily get around
them<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> rim<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.020> close<00:01:10.320> hard<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
them to the rim so if we close hard and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
them to the rim so if we close hard and
drive<00:01:11.310> hard<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> defensive<00:01:12.330> player<00:01:12.540> their

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
drive hard at a defensive player their

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
drive hard at a defensive player their
natural<00:01:13.470> response<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.760> step

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
natural response is going to be to step

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
natural response is going to be to step
back<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.600> create<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.200> arm's<00:01:16.710> length

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
back to create that arm's length

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
back to create that arm's length
distance<00:01:17.100> between<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.119> defender<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
distance between the defender and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
distance between the defender and
ourselves<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.070> gives<00:01:20.280> us<00:01:20.430> prime

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
ourselves that gives us prime

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
ourselves that gives us prime
opportunity<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> step<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.680> create

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
opportunity to step back and create

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
opportunity to step back and create
space<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:25.909> how<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.060> create<00:01:27.450> space<00:01:27.810> now

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
space so how do we create space now

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
space so how do we create space now
what's<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.439> effective<00:01:29.130> way<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.729> create

we're gonna drive right through them to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
we're gonna drive right through them to
the<00:01:40.470> rim<00:01:40.619> that'll<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.610> adjust<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
most by stepping backwards in order to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.760 
most by stepping backwards in order to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
stay in front of you once we have them

moving backwards once their weight is in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
their heels that's the easiest time to

their heels that's the easiest time to
step<00:01:50.790> back<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.479> create<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> move<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.740> why<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:52.950> we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
step back to create a move now why do we

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.109 
step back to create a move now why do we
want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> step<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.490> why<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
want to step back why do we want to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
want to step back why do we want to
create<00:01:54.329> space<00:01:54.659> well<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.920> create<00:01:56.250> space

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
create space well when we create space

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
create space well when we create space
when<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.790> step<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.140> creates<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
when we step back that creates a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
when we step back that creates a
closeout<00:01:59.130> situation<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.630> about<00:02:00.869> think

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
closeout situation so think about think

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.450 
closeout situation so think about think
about<00:02:01.259> anytime<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.950> you've<00:02:02.070> caught<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
about anytime that you've caught the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
about anytime that you've caught the
ball<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> three-point<00:02:03.060> line<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
ball on the three-point line and the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749 
ball on the three-point line and the
defenders<00:02:04.380> been<00:02:04.530> running<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> get

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
defenders been running out to you to get

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
defenders been running out to you to get
a<00:02:05.790> hand<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.299> shot<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a hand up on your shot that's the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740 
a hand up on your shot that's the
easiest<00:02:07.619> time<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> score<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.759> attack<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.569> rib

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
easiest time to score or attack the rib

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.119 
easiest time to score or attack the rib
because<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> defender<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.590> running<00:02:10.830> full

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
because the defender is running full

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.850 
because the defender is running full
speed<00:02:11.489> towards<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.900> step<00:02:13.200> back

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
speed towards you so if we step back

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
speed towards you so if we step back
and<00:02:13.950> show<00:02:14.310> our<00:02:14.520> eyes<00:02:14.730> at<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> rim<00:02:15.600> what<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and show our eyes at the rim what the
