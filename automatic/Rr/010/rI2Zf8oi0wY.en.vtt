00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello everyone decided to rent a garage 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.170
 all live here I will show that I have 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.679
 turned out at the moment the garage here 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:20.180
 such an urban 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:26.730
 this is the first city 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:30.539
 garage 8 squares here are 2 or 2 garage 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 here will be my washing and painting here 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:40.200
 did not have time this year to put the gate 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.579
 as if so, but the frost will fall 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.820
 make the gate 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 here I get a drain hole 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.149
 can only drizzle over the winter 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 your buries from the cerna inside the cube under 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:10.110
 Garage rocket shesterik my dad a little 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.240
 just need to do UAZ but on top somehow 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.240
 so for now 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560
 believe stick out 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.179
 each garage turns out to be 40 squares 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:38.600
 in general, that's such a big car 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:41.149
 It turned out at me but now let 's go in 1 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.450
 garage I already because in the first garage 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:48.619
 here we go mountain now see how 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:58.310
 hydrogen from the automaton in the morning was 50 now 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:02:07.509
 if you see 43 degrees here we go our 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:11.209
 the doors are made right here 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.310
 here I also want to hang a light bulb on the remote 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.760
 so that when you come at night or at the keys 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.220
 on the remote switch switched on here 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.640
 somehow so now let's go in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.840
 inside 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.049
 I'll tell you next we are in the first garage 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.579
 how would my machine come to 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.850
 repairs need to do the box with him 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.519
 Of course it's terrible here. 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.329
 will drive out all the holes that exist 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.889
 on her but she is not talking about my 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:50.480
 so here is a stand like everything is 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:55.840
 at hand immediately the best mess after 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.620
 the last repair was like this 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.549
 locker is on my work clothes on 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.239
 come change my computer stands under 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.239
 diagnostics 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:19.050
 kitchen corner whistled without pale 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 conquer he had a compressor crouched down 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.610
 I have an extra bonus of mine 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:33.090
 too, hands do not reach to paint 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:35.390
 Need some kind of gate like yours 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.200
 hands got outside you saw them 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.420
 the curtain on them 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.190
 it turns out 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:51.050
 stoked I was interested in what to seryoga 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:53.040
 here such here at me from a pipe stick up 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.390
 it turns out I scored them 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 half a meter into the ground and sticking out of the anime 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.730
 15 centimeters to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.110
 and all around the garage so made here 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.200
 behind canisters 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:19.850
 under the table it turns out too tama sticks out 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.850
 first arrival of the garage that is also a cheat 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:30.300
 here I have the same crowd you all this 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.670
 interferes here so see here too not 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.890
 hurry them on 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.840
 it seems not even learn the phone and here 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:44.510
 here, too, here's a question whether they will survive 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.660
 my car is stretching or not if 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.200
 comments if something like write here 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.960
 so here and so here is a question for me 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.050
 it turns out the garage especially fso sleepers like 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.940
 seen or not even there he is from peanut 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:10.770
 lighting as he has done here 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:14.750
 well, how could there be light here 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.100
 the lamp was burning you need to change the map so 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:24.210
 Here trash made this with my brother for 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.110
 whether he harped off his turners 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.630
 bungled with him and that's shorter for me 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:37.740
 the game is based on sleepers and the first 6 screws 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:42.420
 10 how do you feel they are stitched in my 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:47.120
 lock and punched in hundredths and here 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:50.070
 such a question if I them them more precisely 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:57.380
 brewed they say I will 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:59.880
 or to sleep I will do two sides 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.530
 platforms on this our area 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:08.280
 did the hook and want to learn will stand or 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.390
 yet they have me stretch myself 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.120
 last bottoms 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:16.470
 the streets will be good from what’s seen here 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.760
 here already fell didn’t see everything 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:28.310
 sewn tight as it were so up above me 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:35.480
 two rails made here then wilsa 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:37.100
 above is a parallel from the region but 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:44.650
 today we will not work on the street 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.650
 you somehow do not want to be cold like that 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.450
 write comments and likes 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.450
