trim<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.379> be<00:02:42.379> easier<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.739> play<00:02:43.069> with<00:02:44.830> okay

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
trim it to be easier to play with okay

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
idea and how it was done so we have him

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580 
idea and how it was done so we have him
what<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.489> need<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.760> do<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.360> we<00:03:02.660> need<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.870> do

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
what we need to do is then we need to do

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.640 
what we need to do is then we need to do
the<00:03:03.709> mask<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:05.769> quite<00:03:06.769> long<00:03:07.510> thing<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.750> do<00:03:08.930> I'm

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the mask is quite long thing to do I'm

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
the mask is quite long thing to do I'm
just<00:03:09.860> going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.099> be<00:03:10.640> really<00:03:11.060> quickly<00:03:11.480> first<00:03:12.349> we

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
just going to be really quickly first we

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.470 
just going to be really quickly first we
had<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:13.040> adjust<00:03:13.310> mask<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:17.060> enough<00:03:17.450> for

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
had we can adjust mask it's enough for

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.880 
had we can adjust mask it's enough for
showing<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:21.260> go<00:03:22.239> none<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:24.109> we<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.410> see<00:03:24.650> and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
showing I can go none so we can see and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.199 
showing I can go none so we can see and
we<00:03:25.069> have<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.400> go<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:26.299> bit<00:03:27.200> where<00:03:27.440> he's<00:03:28.209> doing

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
we have to go to a bit where he's doing

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.479 
we have to go to a bit where he's doing
so<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:31.420> can<00:03:32.470> finish<00:03:33.470> it

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.630 

you<00:03:38.489> can't<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.360> them<00:03:39.920> okay<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.159> i<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.459> just

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
you can't see them okay so i can just

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.920 
you can't see them okay so i can just
show<00:03:42.049> let's<00:03:43.049> say<00:03:43.230> I'm<00:03:43.470> gonna<00:03:43.830> stop<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.280> frame

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
show let's say I'm gonna stop the frame

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.390 
show let's say I'm gonna stop the frame
and<00:03:45.930> I'm<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.319> going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> show<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.860> how<00:03:47.190> it's

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and I'm just going to show you how it's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.580 
and I'm just going to show you how it's
done<00:03:47.489> without<00:03:47.909> motion<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> if<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.950> do<00:03:51.590> well

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
done without motion so if I do well

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.920 
done without motion so if I do well
basically<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.760> keep<00:03:54.090> all<00:03:54.329> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
basically you have to keep all the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.949 
basically you have to keep all the
movement<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> do<00:03:56.930> mask<00:03:57.930> +<00:03:58.920> M<00:03:59.250> then<00:04:00.120> mask

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
movement so you do mask + M then mask

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.589 
movement so you do mask + M then mask
and<00:04:01.379> then<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.739> have<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.040> go<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.540> adjust<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
and then you have to go to adjust the

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.979 
and then you have to go to adjust the
mast<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.829> take<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:05.940> those<00:04:06.180> points

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
mast like this take all those points

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.319 
mast like this take all those points
move<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.340> legs<00:04:08.700> are<00:04:08.849> changing

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
move it like that the legs are changing

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.960 
move it like that the legs are changing
now<00:04:09.359> here<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.319> would<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.620> easy<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.609> do<00:04:11.940> just

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
now here that would be easy to do just

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.250 
now here that would be easy to do just
like<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:13.349> can<00:04:13.560> get<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.579> here<00:04:15.329> but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
like that you can get just here but

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.409 
like that you can get just here but
that's<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.799> takes<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.310> take<00:04:18.000> out<00:04:18.209> this

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that's what it takes to take out this

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.719 
that's what it takes to take out this
guy<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.199> background<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.709> really<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.310> the

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
guy is the background is really and the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.039 
guy is the background is really and the
foreground<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.359> background<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.870> not

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
foreground and the background is not

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.379 
foreground and the background is not
really<00:04:22.440> different<00:04:23.370> from<00:04:23.550> each<00:04:23.760> other<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.330> it

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
really different from each other so it

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.800 
really different from each other so it
would<00:04:24.810> be<00:04:24.960> really<00:04:25.169> hard<00:04:25.350> okay<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.570> we<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.680> him

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
would be really hard okay so we have him

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.409 
would be really hard okay so we have him
like<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:32.789> have<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.060> do<00:04:33.210> now<00:04:33.240> is

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
like that so what we have to do now is

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.370 
like that so what we have to do now is
we<00:04:33.720> have<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.050> create<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.380> null<00:04:34.889> object<00:04:35.690> now<00:04:36.690> with

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
we have to create a null object now with

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.040 
we have to create a null object now with
this<00:04:37.500> video<00:04:37.919> is<00:04:37.979> really<00:04:38.220> hard<00:04:38.760> because<00:04:39.050> it's

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
this video is really hard because it's

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.020 
this video is really hard because it's
really<00:04:40.289> low<00:04:40.830> quality<00:04:41.130> i<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.520> already<00:04:41.729> two

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
really low quality i have already two

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.820 
really low quality i have already two
hundred<00:04:42.300> percent<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.169> original<00:04:43.410> is

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
hundred percent and the original is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.790 
hundred percent and the original is
really<00:04:44.099> small<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.780> what<00:04:45.780> i<00:04:45.810> will<00:04:45.930> do<00:04:46.200> now<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.590> I

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
really small so what i will do now is I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.629 
really small so what i will do now is I
will<00:04:47.280> take<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:50.130> guy<00:04:50.430> here<00:04:51.139> it's<00:04:52.139> really
