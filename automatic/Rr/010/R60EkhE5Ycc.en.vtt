get<00:00:32.210> started<00:00:32.689> okay<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:33.079> what<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:33.410> usually<00:00:33.680> do<00:00:34.010> is

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
get started okay so what I usually do is

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.020 
get started okay so what I usually do is
I<00:00:34.520> just<00:00:34.579> put<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.450> thin<00:00:35.899> slice<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.280> outside

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
I just put a thin slice on the outside

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.600 
I just put a thin slice on the outside
shell<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.989> both<00:00:39.230> sides<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.890> then<00:00:40.129> I<00:00:40.219> cut<00:00:40.460> one

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
shell on both sides and then I cut one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.580 
shell on both sides and then I cut one
side<00:00:40.850> off<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:41.690> will<00:00:41.809> peel<00:00:42.020> off<00:00:42.050> really

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
side off so that it will peel off really

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.130 
side off so that it will peel off really
easily<00:00:43.360> because<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:44.390> will<00:00:44.600> see<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:44.989> is<00:00:45.110> a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
easily because you will see it is a

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.130 
easily because you will see it is a
thick<00:00:46.930> shell<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:48.980> do<00:00:49.280> want<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.579> have<00:00:49.790> some

and then I will take them out and put
them<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.629> paper<00:02:27.870> towel<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:29.069> put<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.400> well

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
