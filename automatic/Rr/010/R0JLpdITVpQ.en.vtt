00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
ones but now that we're in 0.9.5 I
figured<00:00:33.720> I'd<00:00:33.809> make<00:00:33.900> this<00:00:34.170> video<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> go

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
figured I'd make this video over and go

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
figured I'd make this video over and go
into<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.329> detail<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> must<00:00:37.860> say

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
into more detail so first one I must say

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530 
into more detail so first one I must say
about<00:00:38.250> connecting<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> external<00:00:38.910> servers

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
about connecting to external servers

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
about connecting to external servers
before<00:00:39.900> I<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.320> teaching<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.769> what<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
before I go teaching you what to do and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.860 
before I go teaching you what to do and
stuff<00:00:41.699> is<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:43.110> cannot<00:00:43.769> connect<00:00:44.519> it<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
stuff is if you cannot connect it is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.329 
stuff is if you cannot connect it is
because<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.790> server<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.589> off<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:51.150> server<00:00:51.480> is

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
because the server is off the server is

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.959

connect that is why there's pretty much

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.510 
connect that is why there's pretty much
going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.929> be<00:01:21.990> no<00:01:22.170> other<00:01:22.380> reason<00:01:22.770> unless

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.530 
infinity servers for other servers you
would<00:06:26.310> just<00:06:26.460> have<00:06:26.610> to<00:06:26.730> read<00:06:26.910> it<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.420> would

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
would just have to read it and it would

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.240 
would just have to read it and it would
say<00:06:27.780> do<00:06:27.990> slash<00:06:29.360> register<00:06:30.360> and<00:06:30.800> then<00:06:31.800> once<00:06:32.130> you

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
say do slash register and then once you

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.220 
say do slash register and then once you
do<00:06:32.400> slash<00:06:32.640> register<00:06:33.150> you<00:06:33.750> would<00:06:33.870> put<00:06:34.110> in<00:06:34.200> your

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
do slash register you would put in your

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.410 
do slash register you would put in your
pad<00:06:34.530> you<00:06:34.680> do<00:06:34.950> space<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.580> password<00:06:36.000> so<00:06:36.180> we<00:06:36.210> do

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
pad you do space and password so we do

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.780 
pad you do space and password so we do
poopy<00:06:37.670> face<00:06:39.200> Bobby<00:06:40.200> my<00:06:40.440> password<00:06:40.920> and<00:06:41.160> the<00:06:41.670> way

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
poopy face Bobby my password and the way

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.810 
poopy face Bobby my password and the way
to<00:06:41.850> do<00:06:42.120> slash<00:06:42.630> login<00:06:44.270> poopy<00:06:46.070> face<00:06:47.070> and<00:06:47.460> that's

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
to do slash login poopy face and that's

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.730 
to do slash login poopy face and that's
for<00:06:48.000> other<00:06:48.180> servers<00:06:48.630> that<00:06:48.780> are<00:06:48.840> like<00:06:49.230> that

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
for other servers that are like that

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.650 
for other servers that are like that
after<00:06:50.190> you<00:06:50.250> ask<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:50.730> that's<00:06:50.940> called<00:06:51.180> simple

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
after you ask you that's called simple

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.740 
after you ask you that's called simple
off<00:06:51.840> plug<00:06:52.140> in<00:06:52.430> so<00:06:53.430> that's<00:06:54.060> pretty<00:06:54.300> much<00:06:54.420> it<00:06:54.630> but

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
off plug in so that's pretty much it but

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.240 
off plug in so that's pretty much it but
for<00:06:54.900> this<00:06:55.020> server<00:06:55.290> that's<00:06:55.620> how<00:06:55.740> you<00:06:55.800> log<00:06:56.040> in

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
for this server that's how you log in

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.760 
for this server that's how you log in
for<00:06:56.430> other<00:06:56.880> servers<00:06:57.330> it's<00:06:57.570> different<00:06:58.140> might

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
for other servers it's different might

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.460 
for other servers it's different might
have<00:06:58.919> my<00:06:59.100> speed<00:06:59.340> mod<00:06:59.580> on<00:06:59.760> what<00:06:59.910> the<00:07:00.030> hell

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
have my speed mod on what the hell

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.170 
have my speed mod on what the hell
anyways<00:07:01.470> for<00:07:01.979> other<00:07:02.160> servers<00:07:02.580> it's<00:07:02.760> different

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
anyways for other servers it's different

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.860 
anyways for other servers it's different
so<00:07:03.630> I

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
so I

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.620
