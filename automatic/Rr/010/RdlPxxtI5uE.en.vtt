00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
do like the NFC technology I've only

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
do like the NFC technology I've only
used<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.340> once<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.939> safeway<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.110> worked

used it once at safeway and it worked

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
used it once at safeway and it worked
fantastically<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.670> pretty<00:01:30.000> much

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
stolen left and right and being
vulnerable<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.240> having<00:01:42.479> something

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
vulnerable and I think having something

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
vulnerable and I think having something
like<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.740> NFC<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.479> pay<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.960> things<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
like a NFC way to pay for things that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
like a NFC way to pay for things that
only<00:01:46.500> gives<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.070> device<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.610> unique<00:01:48.119> code<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
only gives the device a unique code that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.649 
only gives the device a unique code that
only<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.729> provides<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> more

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
only it can use actually provides a more

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
only it can use actually provides a more
secure<00:01:52.140> method<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:53.159> credit<00:01:53.610> cards<00:01:53.880> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
secure method than credit cards not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
secure method than credit cards not
saying<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> Apple<00:01:54.990> pay<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.590> defining

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
saying that Apple pay is the defining

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
saying that Apple pay is the defining
thing<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.420> saying<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> NFC<00:01:58.140> technology

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
thing but I'm saying that NFC technology

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.370 
thing but I'm saying that NFC technology
and<00:01:59.310> using<00:01:59.640> stuff<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.570> rather<00:02:01.170> than

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and using stuff like this rather than

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
and using stuff like this rather than
plastic<00:02:01.619> cards<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.149> better<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.689> go

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
plastic cards is the better way to go

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.190 
plastic cards is the better way to go
and<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:05.040> happy<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> Apple<00:02:06.000> has<00:02:06.030> finally<00:02:06.869> yes

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and I'm happy that Apple has finally yes

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.520 
and I'm happy that Apple has finally yes
finally<00:02:07.950> added<00:02:08.700> NFC

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
finally added NFC

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.170 
finally added NFC
to<00:02:09.770> their<00:02:09.950> phones<00:02:10.280> yes<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.729> know<00:02:10.759> it's<00:02:11.000> been

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
to their phones yes I know it's been

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.540 
to their phones yes I know it's been
long<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.110> making<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.190> know<00:02:13.280> it's

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
long in the making but you know it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.580

finally here I also like the user

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.680 
finally here I also like the user

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
thing that I've been seeing is that

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
thing that I've been seeing is that
people<00:03:13.880> who<00:03:14.030> are<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:14.269> starting<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.690> wear

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
people who are now starting to wear

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
people who are now starting to wear
jeans<00:03:15.260> because<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.799> now<00:03:15.920> getting<00:03:16.100> into<00:03:16.370> fall

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
jeans because it's now getting into fall

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.210 
jeans because it's now getting into fall
is<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.720> blue<00:03:18.049> dye<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> genes<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
is that the blue dye in the genes is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.240 
is that the blue dye in the genes is
starting<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.790> die<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.090> plastic<00:03:20.959> parts<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
starting to die the plastic parts on the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.300 
starting to die the plastic parts on the
antennas<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.269> dyeing<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.810> blue<00:03:24.440> color<00:03:25.040> so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
antennas and dyeing it a blue color so

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.340 
antennas and dyeing it a blue color so
if<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.430> don't<00:03:25.579> have<00:03:25.790> some<00:03:26.570> sort<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.840> case<00:03:27.140> on

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
if you don't have some sort of case on

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.840 
if you don't have some sort of case on
it<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.650> could<00:03:27.920> start<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.280> turn<00:03:28.430> these<00:03:28.579> little

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it it could start to turn these little

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.150 
it it could start to turn these little
white<00:03:29.060> bits<00:03:29.299> blue<00:03:29.930> which<00:03:30.200> seems<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.709> little<00:03:30.860> odd

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
white bits blue which seems a little odd

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.210 
white bits blue which seems a little odd
and<00:03:31.910> weird<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.019> always<00:03:33.380> put<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.650> case<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.010> line

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
and weird so I always put a case on line

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.289 
and weird so I always put a case on line
so<00:03:34.370> that's<00:03:34.519> probably<00:03:34.730> never<00:03:34.910> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.150> happen

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
so that's probably never going to happen

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
so that's probably never going to happen

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
series because of this it's because they

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.650 
series because of this it's because they
control<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.280> hardware<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.790> they<00:05:42.300> control

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
and can control it to such a degree that

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.090 
and can control it to such a degree that
it<00:05:48.360> works<00:05:48.660> perfectly<00:05:49.410> with<00:05:49.680> each<00:05:49.860> other
