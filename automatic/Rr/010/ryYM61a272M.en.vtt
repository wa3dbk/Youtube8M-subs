00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
soon as the tip starts within the top

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.539 
soon as the tip starts within the top
window<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.599> kind<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.780> cool<00:03:55.549> shapes

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
window you have that kind of cool shapes

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.479 
window you have that kind of cool shapes
frames<00:03:57.030> kind<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.419> sliding<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.859> there<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.370> have

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
frames kind of sliding so there you have

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.729 
frames kind of sliding so there you have
it<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.729> now<00:03:59.879> have<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.269> skin<00:04:00.569> within<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.260> skin<00:04:01.470> or

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it you now have a skin within a skin or

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.710 
it you now have a skin within a skin or
kind<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.159> clip<00:04:02.310> within<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.579> clip<00:04:02.760> now<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.449> can

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
kind of clip within a clip now you can

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
kind of clip within a clip now you can
then<00:04:03.840> apply<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.199> logic<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.530> absolutely

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
then apply that logic to absolutely

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.469 
then apply that logic to absolutely
anything<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:05.879> example<00:04:06.209> you're<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:06.389> of

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
anything so for example you're one of

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.819 
anything so for example you're one of
those<00:04:06.540> people<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:06.900> loves<00:04:07.049> making<00:04:07.229> montages

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
those people that loves making montages

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.319 
those people that loves making montages
and<00:04:07.979> you<00:04:08.370> think<00:04:08.549> yourself<00:04:08.609> oh<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.209> know<00:04:09.299> I

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
and you think yourself oh you know I

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.759 
and you think yourself oh you know I
can't<00:04:09.599> really<00:04:09.750> do<00:04:09.959> much<00:04:09.989> with<00:04:10.199> a<00:04:10.379> five-click

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
can't really do much with a five-click

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.860 
can't really do much with a five-click
Multi<00:04:11.190> tip<00:04:11.340> that's<00:04:11.790> fine<00:04:12.030> because<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.780> you

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
Multi tip that's fine because if you

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.089 
Multi tip that's fine because if you
think<00:04:12.989> about<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.379> this<00:04:13.620> same<00:04:13.859> principle

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
think about it this same principle

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.550 
think about it this same principle
applies<00:04:14.579> put<00:04:15.419> your<00:04:15.540> fire<00:04:15.780> clips<00:04:16.079> into<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
applies put your fire clips into the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.159 
applies put your fire clips into the
multi<00:04:16.799> clip<00:04:17.039> render<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.909> out<00:04:18.060> stay<00:04:18.780> there

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
multi clip render it out stay there

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.750 
multi clip render it out stay there
go<00:04:19.530> back<00:04:19.709> into<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.979> multi<00:04:20.250> clip<00:04:20.430> template

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
go back into the multi clip template

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.640 
go back into the multi clip template
take<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.599> clip<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.019> made<00:04:22.229> with<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
take that clip that you made with the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.260 
take that clip that you made with the
five<00:04:22.830> clips<00:04:23.099> put<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.580> into<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.820> first<00:04:24.090> pocket

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
five clips put it into the first pocket

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.450 
five clips put it into the first pocket
then<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.050> have<00:04:25.200> another<00:04:25.440> four<00:04:25.710> clips

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
then you have another four clips

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.830 
then you have another four clips
so<00:04:26.550> then<00:04:26.699> you<00:04:26.759> put<00:04:26.789> them<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.389> now<00:04:27.569> you<00:04:27.630> have

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
so then you put them in and now you have

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.710 
so then you put them in and now you have
an<00:04:28.080> only<00:04:28.259> multi<00:04:28.889> dip<00:04:29.069> upload<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.030> put<00:04:30.630> it

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
an only multi dip upload that put it

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.840 
an only multi dip upload that put it
back<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.990> add<00:04:31.530> another<00:04:31.800> four<00:04:32.069> and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.789> you

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
back in add another four and then you

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.510 
back in add another four and then you
have<00:04:33.319> 13<00:04:34.370> yes<00:04:35.370> my<00:04:35.729> maths<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.120> there<00:04:36.300> 13<00:04:37.080> clips

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
have 13 yes my maths is there 13 clips

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.800 
have 13 yes my maths is there 13 clips
so<00:04:38.520> as<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.210> can<00:04:39.330> see<00:04:39.389> okay

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
so as you can see okay

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.180 
so as you can see okay
I<00:04:39.900> mean<00:04:40.080> I'm<00:04:40.169> admittedly<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.889> little<00:04:41.099> bit

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
I mean I'm admittedly it's a little bit

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.980 
I mean I'm admittedly it's a little bit
hacky<00:04:41.430> little<00:04:41.639> bit<00:04:41.729> kind<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:41.910> long-winded<00:04:42.270> but

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
hacky little bit kind of long-winded but

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.719 
hacky little bit kind of long-winded but
the<00:04:43.919> important<00:04:44.280> thing<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.400> I'm<00:04:44.520> trying<00:04:44.580> to

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
the important thing that I'm trying to

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.890 
the important thing that I'm trying to
highlight<00:04:44.849> is<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.120> there<00:04:45.360> are<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.509> lot<00:04:45.870> of

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
highlight is that there are a lot of

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.150 
highlight is that there are a lot of
things<00:04:46.199> you<00:04:46.319> can<00:04:46.440> do<00:04:46.560> with<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.039> with

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
things you can do with this and with

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.680 
things you can do with this and with
some<00:04:47.460> clever<00:04:47.699> use<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.000> templates<00:04:48.389> clever<00:04:48.569> use

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
some clever use the templates clever use

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.270 
some clever use the templates clever use
of<00:04:48.720> skins<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.560> can<00:04:49.680> get<00:04:49.800> some<00:04:49.919> really<00:04:50.190> cool

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
of skins you can get some really cool

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 
of skins you can get some really cool
effects<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.849> fact<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.449> can<00:04:51.599> also<00:04:51.750> even

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
effects in fact you can also even

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.600 
effects in fact you can also even
overlay<00:04:52.440> even<00:04:52.740> more<00:04:52.889> skins<00:04:53.160> if<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.310> want<00:04:53.490> so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
overlay even more skins if you want so

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
overlay even more skins if you want so
so<00:04:53.729> for<00:04:53.849> example<00:04:54.180> when<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.300> was<00:04:54.389> just<00:04:54.539> showing

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
so for example when I was just showing

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.020 
so for example when I was just showing
you<00:04:54.840> there<00:04:55.020> what<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> could<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:55.919> done<00:04:56.030> you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you there what I could have done you

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.580 
you there what I could have done you
know<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.150> can<00:04:57.389> overlay<00:04:57.690> Chevron's<00:04:58.169> on<00:04:58.319> top<00:04:58.470> of

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
know I can overlay Chevron's on top of

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.990 
know I can overlay Chevron's on top of
frames<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.130> then<00:04:59.280> suddenly<00:04:59.610> when<00:04:59.759> you<00:04:59.820> get<00:04:59.940> the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
frames so then suddenly when you get the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.279 
frames so then suddenly when you get the
frame<00:05:00.180> opened<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.630> get<00:05:00.750> everyone<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.199> goes

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
frame opened you get everyone that goes

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.719 
frame opened you get everyone that goes
across<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:02.070> you<00:05:02.099> can<00:05:02.250> get<00:05:02.340> some<00:05:02.460> really<00:05:02.639> really

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
across so you can get some really really

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.390 
across so you can get some really really
cool<00:05:03.030> effects<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.810> um<00:05:04.169> yeah<00:05:04.680> that's<00:05:05.099> pretty

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
cool effects so um yeah that's pretty

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920 
cool effects so um yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.669> that's<00:05:05.699> kind<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.030> my<00:05:06.180> my<00:05:06.690> sort<00:05:06.870> of
