here I have my 1600 watt 4 channel amp

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.840 
here I have my 1600 watt 4 channel amp
and<00:00:25.100> right<00:00:26.100> now<00:00:26.190> I'm<00:00:26.310> only<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.640> two

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
and right now I'm only using two

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.700 
and right now I'm only using two
channels<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.480> only<00:00:27.600> have<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> two

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
channels because I only have a two

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.450 
channels because I only have a two
channels<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.990> my<00:00:30.990> input<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.189> phone

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

I'm gonna play some music for you guys

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.180 
I'm gonna play some music for you guys
or<00:00:33.780> not

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
or not

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.580 
or not
anyways<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> my<00:00:35.989> splitter<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.440> my

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
anyways this is my splitter for my

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
anyways this is my splitter for my
positive<00:00:38.120> wire<00:00:39.120> connected<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
positive wire connected right to the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
positive wire connected right to the
battery<00:00:40.730> goes<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.420> there's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
battery goes in here and then there's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740 
battery goes in here and then there's
two<00:00:42.720> fuses<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.520> each<00:00:44.640> amp<00:00:44.910> each

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
two fuses and then one for each amp each

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
two fuses and then one for each amp each
wire<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.680> wire<00:00:46.920> goes<00:00:47.130> into<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
wire and then this wire goes into the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.330 
wire and then this wire goes into the
positive<00:00:47.640> lead<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> amplifiers<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.340> then

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
positive lead on the amplifiers and then

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
positive lead on the amplifiers and then
the<00:00:50.610> negative<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> little

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the negative is right here in the little

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.280 
the negative is right here in the little
splitting<00:00:53.219> block<00:00:53.430> block<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.450> this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
splitting block block right here this

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.260 
splitting block block right here this
negative<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.399> also<00:00:56.700> hooked<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
negative is also hooked up to the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.830 
negative is also hooked up to the
battery<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> remote<00:00:59.820> wire<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.690> could

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
battery and the remote wire you could

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.250 
battery and the remote wire you could
just<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.649> two<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.309> use<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.049> crimp<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
just get these two and use a crimp to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
just get these two and use a crimp to
connect<00:01:05.010> those<00:01:05.129> together<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.119> run

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
connect those together and then just run

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
connect those together and then just run
one<00:01:06.659> single<00:01:07.170> wire<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.680> head<00:01:07.890> unit<00:01:08.220> which

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
one single wire to your head unit which

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
one single wire to your head unit which
will<00:01:09.060> power<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.840> often<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
will power it on an often but this is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.870 
will power it on an often but this is
what<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:11.310> since<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> not

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
what I have right now since is not

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
what I have right now since is not
actually<00:01:12.299> connected<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> car<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.830> have

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
actually connected in the car you have

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.760 
actually connected in the car you have
to<00:01:14.040> say<00:01:14.220> both<00:01:14.520> power<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> flip<00:01:16.470> switch

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to say both power up when I flip switch

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
to say both power up when I flip switch
and<00:01:17.630> let's<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> guess<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.470> going

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and let's see if I can guess I'm going

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.380 
and let's see if I can guess I'm going
to<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.100> guys<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:26.760> it's<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.060> a

the<00:02:30.060> house<00:02:30.209> done<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.599> got<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.049> little

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the house done I got this little

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.509 
the house done I got this little
splitters<00:02:32.010> right<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:34.340> remote<00:02:35.340> wire

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
splitters right here and remote wire

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.720 
splitters right here and remote wire
that's<00:02:36.000> pretty<00:02:36.480> basic<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.459> some<00:02:38.459> people

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
that's pretty basic but some people

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
that's pretty basic but some people
don't<00:02:39.690> know<00:02:39.750> how<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:40.380> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
don't know how to do it so I'm just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.070 
don't know how to do it so I'm just
showing<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.950> guys<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.660> back<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.959> your

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
showing you guys on the back of your

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680 
showing you guys on the back of your
head<00:02:43.230> unit<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> should<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:44.040> an<00:02:44.580> output<00:02:45.420> for

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
head unit you should have an output for

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.270 
head unit you should have an output for
a<00:02:45.720> subwoofer<00:02:47.780> which<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.959> metal<00:02:49.170> right<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a subwoofer which is metal right and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.860 
a subwoofer which is metal right and
then<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:52.109> four<00:02:52.350> channel<00:02:53.570> for<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:57.060> amplifier

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
then the four channel for this amplifier

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.670 
then the four channel for this amplifier
is<00:02:58.190> usually<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> back<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> stereo<00:03:00.090> too

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
is usually in the back of the stereo too
