00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
could use something like this which is a

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.500 
could use something like this which is a
liner<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:06.340> tend<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> use<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.000> loss<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.300> think

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
liner I tend to use the loss I think

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.210 
liner I tend to use the loss I think
it's<00:04:07.600> very<00:04:07.750> very<00:04:08.050> effective<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.890> delivery

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
it's very very effective so delivery

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.580 
it's very very effective so delivery
what<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.730> do<00:04:09.850> pick<00:04:10.810> out<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.050> moss

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
what we do pick out the moss

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.080 
what we do pick out the moss
fluff<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.400> out

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
fluff it out

pack it in Gooden ties up against the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.730 
pack it in Gooden ties up against the
sides

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.770

that's<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.069> fairly<00:04:34.819> straightforward<00:04:35.110> stuff

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
that's it fairly straightforward stuff

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.450 
that's it fairly straightforward stuff
so<00:04:36.710> that's<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:37.039> done<00:04:38.259> then<00:04:39.259> what<00:04:40.189> you<00:04:40.279> need

it's good for drainage the other thing
you<00:04:52.729> need<00:04:52.759> is<00:04:53.029> some<00:04:53.330> kind<00:04:53.449> of<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.629> fertilizer

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
you need is some kind of a fertilizer

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.230 
you need is some kind of a fertilizer
this<00:04:54.710> one<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.009> slow<00:04:55.370> release<00:04:55.729> fertilizer

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
this one is a slow release fertilizer

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.649 
this one is a slow release fertilizer
but<00:04:56.629> it<00:04:56.719> also<00:04:56.870> contains<00:04:57.409> water<00:04:58.189> gel<00:04:58.610> an<00:04:59.150> agent

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
but it also contains water gel an agent

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.230 
but it also contains water gel an agent
that<00:04:59.809> holds<00:05:00.229> water<00:05:00.289> holds<00:05:01.039> moisture<00:05:01.189> in<00:05:01.639> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
that holds water holds moisture in the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.719 
that holds water holds moisture in the
Indus<00:05:03.199> aisle<00:05:03.379> okay<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:03.949> we<00:05:04.039> put<00:05:04.069> some<00:05:04.249> of<00:05:04.520> this

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
Indus aisle okay so we put some of this

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.029 
Indus aisle okay so we put some of this
into<00:05:05.029> soil<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.689> then<00:05:05.779> into<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.050> exactly<00:05:06.770> so

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
into soil and then into that exactly so

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.230 
into soil and then into that exactly so
basically<00:05:07.279> what<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.520> do<00:05:07.639> is<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.819> mix<00:05:08.029> that

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
basically what you do is you mix that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.079 
basically what you do is you mix that
through<00:05:08.719> the<00:05:08.900> soil<00:05:09.370> then<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:10.400> put<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.819> soil

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:11.089 
through the soil then you put the soil

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.909 
through the soil then you put the soil
directly<00:05:11.629> into<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.050> basket<00:05:12.439> this<00:05:12.589> already

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.159 

when<00:05:22.730> you<00:05:22.820> compact<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.390> down

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
when you compact it down

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.679 
when you compact it down
