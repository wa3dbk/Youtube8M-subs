that<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> see<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.850> probably<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
that you see here is probably one of the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.060 
that you see here is probably one of the
earliest<00:00:18.779> models<00:00:18.930> pictures<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.039> have

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
earliest models pictures that we have

earliest models pictures that we have
available<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> brake<00:00:21.779> handle<00:00:22.140> on

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
there the brake handle is consistent

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.250 
there the brake handle is consistent
through<00:00:24.150> all<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> years<00:00:24.570> that's<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> book

the<00:00:25.380> only<00:00:25.439> way<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.160> recognize<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the only way I can really recognize it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.330 
the only way I can really recognize it
as<00:00:27.000> being<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.359> Louis<00:00:27.630> winch<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.740> particular

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
as being a Louis winch this particular

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.910 
as being a Louis winch this particular
model<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.240> chain<00:00:30.599> drive<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.650> didn't

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
model was a chain drive now it didn't

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.229 
model was a chain drive now it didn't
use<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> same<00:00:32.340> kind<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> chain<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.940> used<00:00:33.090> today

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
use the same kind of chain we used today

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
use the same kind of chain we used today
it<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:33.780> used<00:00:33.960> roller<00:00:34.290> chain<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.829> had

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
it actually used roller chain so you had

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.459 
it actually used roller chain so you had
to<00:00:35.219> convert<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.149> chain<00:00:36.420> saw<00:00:36.450> over<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> roller

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to convert your chain saw over to roller

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
to convert your chain saw over to roller
chain<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.010> order<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.399> run<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.910> Louis<00:00:39.210> winch

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
chain in order to run this Louis winch

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
chain in order to run this Louis winch
but<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> sprocket<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.100> there

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
but you can see the sprocket in there

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
but you can see the sprocket in there
you<00:00:41.399> had<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> once<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.690> bolted<00:00:43.050> up

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you had to once you have that bolted up

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.690 
you had to once you have that bolted up
you<00:00:43.230> had<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> run<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.710> chain<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> did

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you had to run your chain on but it did

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
you had to run your chain on but it did
the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:44.969> thing<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.270> today<00:00:45.480> didn't<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.930> as

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the same thing as today didn't have as

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
the same thing as today didn't have as
much<00:00:46.170> power<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.710> course<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> did<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
much power of course but but it did the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
much power of course but but it did the
job<00:00:48.649> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.860> next<00:00:50.250> evolution<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
job this is the next evolution of the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
job this is the next evolution of the
Louis<00:00:51.449> winch<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:52.379> these<00:00:52.559> ones<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:53.460> very

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Louis winch now these ones are very

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
Louis winch now these ones are very
similar<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:54.899> today<00:00:54.930> again

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
similar to what you see today again

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
similar to what you see today again
you'll<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> brake<00:00:56.280> handle<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.699> exactly

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you'll see the brake handle is exactly

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
you'll see the brake handle is exactly
the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.410> fairlead<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> much<00:00:59.370> narrower

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the same the fairlead is much narrower

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
the same the fairlead is much narrower
we've<00:01:00.300> widened<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> fairlead<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
we've widened the fairlead out now so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
we've widened the fairlead out now so
it's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> full<00:01:02.250> width<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> spool<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's the full width of the spool so it's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's the full width of the spool so it's
easy<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> wind<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> cable<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.589> nice<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.860> even

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
easy to wind the cable on nice and even

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
easy to wind the cable on nice and even
and<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> model<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> crank

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and on this model you can see the crank

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
and on this model you can see the crank
on<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> clutch<00:01:07.799> channel<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> clutch

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
on the clutch channel so the clutch

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.149 
on the clutch channel so the clutch
screwed<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> hole<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> sprocket<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
screwed into a hole in the sprocket so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.890 
screwed into a hole in the sprocket so
that<00:01:11.640> has<00:01:11.820> changed<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> lot<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.810> years

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that has changed a lot over the years

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
that has changed a lot over the years
and<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:13.979> were<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.490> piece<00:01:14.760> aluminum

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and these were a two piece aluminum

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
and these were a two piece aluminum
housing<00:01:15.689> whereas<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.380> all

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
housing whereas now it's all

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
housing whereas now it's all
state-of-the-art<00:01:16.920> one-piece<00:01:17.759> aluminum<00:01:17.790> all

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
state-of-the-art one-piece aluminum all

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
state-of-the-art one-piece aluminum all
machined<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.960> CNC<00:01:19.530> machines<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.430> big

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
machined on CNC machines so a big

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.280 
machined on CNC machines so a big
difference<00:01:20.909> between<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.659> model<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> new
