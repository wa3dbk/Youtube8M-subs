try all the tricks on the snow i touch

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.430 
try all the tricks on the snow i touch
my<00:01:53.800> head<00:01:53.980> you're<00:01:54.160> good<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.540> we<00:01:55.780> use<00:01:55.930> bubble<00:01:56.260> for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
my head you're good so we use bubble for

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.260 
my head you're good so we use bubble for
two<00:01:56.560> reasons<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.950> visual<00:01:57.280> cue<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.880> soften

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
two reasons a visual cue is and soften

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.800 
two reasons a visual cue is and soften
the<00:01:58.360> land<00:01:59.370> basically<00:02:00.370> after<00:02:00.700> 12<00:02:01.240> feet<00:02:01.540> water

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
the land basically after 12 feet water

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.660 
the land basically after 12 feet water
is<00:02:02.050> concrete

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is concrete

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.350 
is concrete
so<00:02:03.270> without<00:02:03.420> bubbles<00:02:03.720> it's<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.229> very<00:02:04.500> hard

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360
