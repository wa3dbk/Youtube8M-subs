own I think it's interesting how John
looks<00:01:39.620> looks<00:01:40.580> back<00:01:40.900> in<00:01:41.900> order<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:42.560> he<00:01:42.770> makes

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
looks looks back in order but he makes

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.610

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
completely original but he went back to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.510 
completely original but he went back to
the<00:01:49.850> kind<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.150> shook<00:01:50.300> own<00:01:50.680> form<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.430> I

to me how composers reinvent the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
possibilities today that I don't think

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.070 
possibilities today that I don't think
Beethoven<00:02:34.430> had<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.120> mean<00:02:35.300> even<00:02:35.480> physically

which<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.050> guess<00:03:49.590> we<00:03:49.890> play<00:03:50.130> many<00:03:50.700> times<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.270> think

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
which I guess we play many times I think

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.450 
which I guess we play many times I think
I<00:03:51.570> said<00:03:51.720> many<00:03:51.960> times<00:03:51.990> I'm<00:03:52.320> sure<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.830> lady

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
I said many times I'm sure you have lady

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.180 
I said many times I'm sure you have lady
many<00:03:53.670> times<00:03:53.880> when<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.090> guess<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.840> always<00:03:55.190> find

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
many times when I guess we always find

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.920 
many times when I guess we always find
something<00:03:56.430> exciting<00:03:57.030> something<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.540> yeah

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
something exciting something you yeah

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.520 
something exciting something you yeah
and<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.230> think<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.680> same<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.070> the<00:04:00.530> it's

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
and I think it's the same of the it's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.220 
and I think it's the same of the it's
completely<00:04:02.040> revolutionary

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
completely revolutionary

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.680 
completely revolutionary
and<00:04:03.800> again<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:04.760> come<00:04:04.879> back<00:04:05.060> from<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.330> idea<00:04:05.599> of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
and again we come back from the idea of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.410 
and again we come back from the idea of
scale<00:04:06.099> running<00:04:07.099> throughout<00:04:07.370> it's<00:04:07.909> like<00:04:08.120> this

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
scale running throughout it's like this

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.509 
scale running throughout it's like this
like<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.599> actually<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.159> as<00:04:13.280> geese

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
like I actually think of it as geese

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.300 
like I actually think of it as geese
intricately<00:04:14.150> made<00:04:14.330> out<00:04:14.720> mosaic<00:04:15.590> tiles<00:04:15.950> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
intricately made out mosaic tiles and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.030 
intricately made out mosaic tiles and
then<00:04:16.669> it's<00:04:16.790> always<00:04:17.389> undulating<00:04:18.040> always

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
then it's always undulating always

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.260 
then it's always undulating always
moving<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:20.660> know<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.900> violence<00:04:21.290> kind<00:04:21.560> of

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
moving and you know the violence kind of

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.180 
moving and you know the violence kind of
you<00:04:23.270> know<00:04:23.330> floating<00:04:24.320> sometimes<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:24.919> top

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
you know floating sometimes on top

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.820 
you know floating sometimes on top
sometimes<00:04:25.750> interweaving<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.380> just<00:04:27.680> an

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
sometimes interweaving and it's just an

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.430 
sometimes interweaving and it's just an
amazing<00:04:28.330> piece<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.600> think<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.990> two<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.380> you

dance too I mean both of them yeah I
mean<00:04:35.449> in<00:04:35.690> very<00:04:35.930> different<00:04:36.139> ways<00:04:36.289> but<00:04:39.820> yeah

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
mean in very different ways but yeah

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.760 
mean in very different ways but yeah
there's<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:41.479> something<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.440> groove

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
there's just something to it a groove

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.129 
there's just something to it a groove
and<00:04:43.130> Beethoven<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.180> guess<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.810> end<00:04:44.960> of

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
and Beethoven to I guess the end of

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.600 
and Beethoven to I guess the end of
their<00:04:45.260> movement<00:04:45.740> absolutely<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.310> actually

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
their movement absolutely I actually

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.520 
their movement absolutely I actually
feel<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.389> entire<00:04:47.660> piece<00:04:47.990> in<00:04:48.229> entire

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
feel it in the entire piece in entire

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.020 
feel it in the entire piece in entire
being<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:48.860> it's<00:04:49.070> actually<00:04:49.400> interesting<00:04:49.639> do

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
being and it's actually interesting do

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.300 
being and it's actually interesting do
pairing<00:04:50.539> it<00:04:50.660> with<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.960> atoms<00:04:51.289> because<00:04:51.710> it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
pairing it with the atoms because it

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.719 
pairing it with the atoms because it
brings<00:04:52.639> that<00:04:52.880> out<00:04:52.940> even<00:04:53.330> more<00:04:53.360> oh<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:55.580> this

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
brings that out even more oh so this

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.000 
brings that out even more oh so this
entire<00:04:55.940> idea<00:04:56.389> of<00:04:56.600> like<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.260> larger<00:04:57.620> bead<00:04:57.830> in

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
entire idea of like the larger bead in

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.300 
entire idea of like the larger bead in
the<00:04:58.100> bar<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.850> how<00:04:59.389> we<00:04:59.449> feel<00:04:59.840> it<00:05:00.020> like<00:05:00.310> crossing

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
the bar and how we feel it like crossing

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.879 
the bar and how we feel it like crossing
over<00:05:01.430> several<00:05:02.000> bar<00:05:02.300> lines<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:03.770> know

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
over several bar lines you know

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.909 
over several bar lines you know
especially<00:05:04.160> in<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.639> last<00:05:04.760> movement

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.350 

it's<00:05:08.919> just<00:05:09.159> from<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.430> technical<00:05:10.060> point<00:05:10.300> of

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
it's just from the technical point of

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.839 
it's just from the technical point of
view<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.900> know<00:05:10.960> John<00:05:11.379> um<00:05:11.680> we<00:05:12.370> were<00:05:12.490> talking

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
view and I know John um we were talking

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.909 
view and I know John um we were talking
about<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.330> with<00:05:13.569> John<00:05:13.870> yesterday<00:05:14.409> you're

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
about this with John yesterday you're

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.939 
about this with John yesterday you're
saying<00:05:15.159> that<00:05:16.110> technically<00:05:17.110> it's<00:05:17.590> quite

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
saying that technically it's quite

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.469 
saying that technically it's quite
different<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.490> mean<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.759> means<00:05:18.939> we<00:05:19.180> have<00:05:19.330> today

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
different I mean the means we have today

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.360 
different I mean the means we have today
and<00:05:19.810> even<00:05:19.900> when<00:05:20.169> we<00:05:20.229> think<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.830> piece<00:05:21.039> your

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
and even when we think of the piece your

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.270 
and even when we think of the piece your
frustration<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:23.289> possibilities<00:05:24.099> the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
frustration and the possibilities the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.820 
frustration and the possibilities the
instruments<00:05:24.729> he<00:05:24.849> use<00:05:25.030> as<00:05:25.270> John<00:05:25.539> uses<00:05:25.830> these

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
instruments he use as John uses these

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.339 
instruments he use as John uses these
keyboards<00:05:27.189> of<00:05:27.580> examples<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.449> that<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:29.020> key<00:05:29.319> to

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
keyboards of examples and that is key to

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.469 
keyboards of examples and that is key to
making<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.099> second<00:05:30.400> movement<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:30.789> magical<00:05:31.300> to

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
making the second movement so magical to

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.629 
making the second movement so magical to
me<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.349> also<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.770> possibilities<00:05:33.400> within

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
me and also the possibilities within

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.300 
me and also the possibilities within
each<00:05:34.000> excellent<00:05:34.569> yeah<00:05:36.090> yeah<00:05:37.090> yes<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.560> up<00:05:38.770> for

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
each excellent yeah yeah yes but up for

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.119 
each excellent yeah yeah yes but up for
you<00:05:39.520> as<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.699> performer<00:05:40.169> was<00:05:41.169> if<00:05:41.560> your<00:05:41.830> approach

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
you as a performer was if your approach

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.830 
you as a performer was if your approach
different<00:05:42.550> are<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.090> challenges<00:05:43.270> very

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
different are the challenges very

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.450 
different are the challenges very
different<00:05:44.199> technically<00:05:44.770> when<00:05:45.099> you<00:05:45.189> look<00:05:45.340> at

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
different technically when you look at

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.019 
different technically when you look at
some<00:05:46.240> pieces<00:05:46.529> not<00:05:47.529> so<00:05:47.889> much<00:05:48.069> technically<00:05:48.789> I

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
some pieces not so much technically I

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.189 
some pieces not so much technically I
say<00:05:50.219> you<00:05:51.219> know<00:05:51.250> in<00:05:51.550> a<00:05:51.639> way<00:05:51.819> like<00:05:52.629> the<00:05:52.810> approach

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
say you know in a way like the approach

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.760 
say you know in a way like the approach
to<00:05:53.710> sound<00:05:54.279> a<00:05:54.610> little<00:05:55.120> bit<00:05:55.360> different<00:05:55.779> because

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
to sound a little bit different because

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.350 
to sound a little bit different because
the<00:05:57.219> orchestration<00:05:57.879> is<00:05:57.969> very<00:05:58.180> different

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
the orchestration is very different

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.059 
the orchestration is very different
because<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:59.020> time<00:05:59.349> in<00:05:59.590> which<00:05:59.620> they<00:06:00.009> were

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
because the time in which they were

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.409 
because the time in which they were
created<00:06:00.300> are<00:06:01.300> so<00:06:01.569> different<00:06:02.610> so<00:06:03.610> but<00:06:04.029> I<00:06:04.060> think

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
created are so different so but I think

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.119 
created are so different so but I think
it's<00:06:04.599> also<00:06:04.719> individual<00:06:05.409> to<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.620> pieces

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
it's also individual to the pieces

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.219 
it's also individual to the pieces
because<00:06:06.610> again<00:06:07.029> if<00:06:07.210> I<00:06:07.300> think<00:06:07.509> of<00:06:07.659> John's<00:06:07.990> other

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
because again if I think of John's other

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.439 
because again if I think of John's other
piece<00:06:08.469> for<00:06:08.949> violent<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.729> would<00:06:09.879> one<00:06:10.120> of<00:06:10.150> which

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
piece for violent and would one of which

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.810 
piece for violent and would one of which
is<00:06:10.479> Road<00:06:10.960> movies

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
is Road movies

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.970 
is Road movies
yeah<00:06:12.090> it's<00:06:12.840> also<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.140> slightly<00:06:13.680> different

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
yeah it's also a slightly different

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.740 
yeah it's also a slightly different
approach<00:06:14.160> than<00:06:14.430> one<00:06:14.970> would<00:06:15.150> take<00:06:15.360> with<00:06:15.630> the

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
approach than one would take with the

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.580 
approach than one would take with the
concerto<00:06:16.170> so<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.590> think<00:06:16.920> it's<00:06:17.190> also<00:06:17.340> individual

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
concerto so I think it's also individual

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.650 
concerto so I think it's also individual
well<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:19.620> think<00:06:20.520> this<00:06:20.910> is<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.240> most<00:06:21.270> fabulous

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
well I think this is the most fabulous

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.520 
well I think this is the most fabulous
program<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:24.120> I'm<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.630> glad<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.050> you
