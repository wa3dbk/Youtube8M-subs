 boss mullen conquers all 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.930
 world slipping here is because it is I think 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:31.350
 which is the serpentine effect that you 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.660

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.580

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.530
 compensates for its shortcomings with a 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.540
 animation with that stick face that is 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.570

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.880
 songs that you will present that you 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.210
 take the microphone away for you 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.400
 be able to have a better diction achieve 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.040

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.410
 Someone who can kiss this 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.410
 drug in his championship 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.830
 He has to understand that we are 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.830
 dealing with children 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.150
