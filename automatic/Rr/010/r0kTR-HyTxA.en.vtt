00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
if we look at the connector it is a 4

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
if we look at the connector it is a 4
conductor<00:01:58.079> connector<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.460> hard

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
conductor connector it's a little hard

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.469 
conductor connector it's a little hard
to<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.180> through<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.140> opaque<00:02:02.479> plastic

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
to see that through this opaque plastic

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
to see that through this opaque plastic
but<00:02:03.689> there's<00:02:03.899> four<00:02:04.079> conductors<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but there's four conductors there so it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
but there's four conductors there so it
has<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> microphone<00:02:06.270> built<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> cord

is<00:02:38.580> probably<00:02:39.270> inside<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:39.990> case<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.680> just

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
is probably inside the case and just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.490 
is probably inside the case and just
needs<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:42.030> plastic<00:02:42.480> removed<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the case off that was very easy sure

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.370

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.480 
out and it looks like the zoom goes here
very<00:03:12.270> hard<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.720> see<00:03:12.990> but<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> symbol

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
very hard to see but there is a symbol

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.660 
very hard to see but there is a symbol
that<00:03:14.940> makes<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.300> look<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.900> notch

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
that makes it look like the notch

that makes it look like the notch
goes<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.630> that's<00:03:21.780> where<00:03:22.050> your

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
goes like this so that's where your

goes like this so that's where your
t-mobile<00:03:22.620> SIM<00:03:22.950> goes<00:03:23.250> there's<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.090> battery

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
t-mobile SIM goes there's the battery

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.810 
t-mobile SIM goes there's the battery
contacts<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.200> there<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> contacts<00:03:26.520> on<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
contacts and there the contacts on the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:36.380 
contacts and there the contacts on the
battery<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.350> goes<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.709> battery<00:03:35.090> very<00:03:36.090> easy

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
battery so in goes the battery very easy

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.199 
battery so in goes the battery very easy
to<00:03:36.690> get<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.050> battery<00:03:37.290> cover<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.190> off<00:03:38.340> now

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
to get that battery cover on and off now

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.240 
to get that battery cover on and off now
here's<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.750> size<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> phone<00:03:40.590> compared<00:03:41.100> to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
here's the size of the phone compared to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.880 
here's the size of the phone compared to
a<00:03:41.280> credit<00:03:41.700> card<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:43.050> is<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> pretty

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
a credit card so this is a pretty

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.449 
a credit card so this is a pretty
substantial<00:03:44.250> phone<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.690> it's

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
substantial phone you can see it's

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.340 
substantial phone you can see it's
larger<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.610> both<00:03:47.820> directions<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:49.110> that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
larger in both directions then that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.500 
larger in both directions then that
credit<00:03:49.769> card<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.310> but<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.180> very<00:03:51.570> slim<00:03:52.110> so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
credit card is but it is very slim so

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.250 
credit card is but it is very slim so
HTC<00:03:54.510> made<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> decision<00:03:55.320> there<00:03:55.530> too<00:03:56.239> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
HTC made a decision there too to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.750 
HTC made a decision there too to
minimize<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.620> thickness<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> phone

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
minimize the thickness of the phone

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.140 
minimize the thickness of the phone
of<00:03:59.940> course<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.650> 4.3<00:04:01.650> inch<00:04:01.830> screen<00:04:02.150> maximizes

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
of course the 4.3 inch screen maximizes

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.410 
of course the 4.3 inch screen maximizes
the<00:04:03.300> overall<00:04:03.780> area<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.890> phone<00:04:05.070> takes<00:04:05.400> up<00:04:05.670> so

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the overall area the phone takes up so

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.780 
the overall area the phone takes up so
let's<00:04:06.630> go<00:04:06.810> ahead<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.260> turn<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.980> on<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.459> see

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
let's go ahead and turn it on and see

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.960 
let's go ahead and turn it on and see
what<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.030> get

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:25.560 

I'm<00:04:14.970> gonna<00:04:15.120> zoom<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.600> little<00:04:15.780> bit

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.410
