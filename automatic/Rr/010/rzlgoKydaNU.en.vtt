Colossus<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.719> video<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Colossus now that is what this video is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
Colossus now that is what this video is
about<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.490> review<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.509> champion

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
about this is my review of the champion

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
about this is my review of the champion
that<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> believe<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> rarest<00:02:06.600> in

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that I believe is one of the rarest in

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.530 
that I believe is one of the rarest in
the<00:02:06.840> game<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
the game of this

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.060 
the game of this
well<00:02:07.900> apart<00:02:08.170> from<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.380> realm<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.649> residence

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
well apart from the realm of residence

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.980 
well apart from the realm of residence
would<00:02:09.280> probably<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.090> Deadpool<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.509> stuff

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
would probably the Deadpool and stuff

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.280 
would probably the Deadpool and stuff
like<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.980> pretty<00:02:12.880> rare<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.720> these<00:02:14.230> are

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
like that it's pretty rare so these are

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.990 
like that it's pretty rare so these are
synergies<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.580> going<00:02:15.760> through

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
synergies that I was just going through

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.540 
synergies that I was just going through
and<00:02:16.560> especially<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.830> pretty<00:02:18.010> much<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> same

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and especially the pretty much the same

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.780 
and especially the pretty much the same
as<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.840> regular<00:02:20.020> Colossus<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.550> his

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
as the regular Colossus but his

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.790 
as the regular Colossus but his
signature<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.510> unstoppable<00:02:22.780> which<00:02:23.620> is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
signature but it is unstoppable which is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520 
signature but it is unstoppable which is
locked<00:02:24.040> at<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.820> point<00:02:25.290> okay<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.350> now<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
locked at this point okay so now that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.470 
locked at this point okay so now that
that's<00:02:26.740> done<00:02:26.890> we're<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.820> put<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.270> team

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
that's done we're going to put a team

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.050 
that's done we're going to put a team
together<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:29.800> going<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.010> use<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.880> team

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
together and I'm going to use this team

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.060 
together and I'm going to use this team
for<00:02:31.210> synergies<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.810> also<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.530> don't<00:02:32.710> have<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
for synergies and also I don't have a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.320 
for synergies and also I don't have a
four-star<00:02:33.460> Colossus<00:02:33.880> summer<00:02:34.060> use<00:02:34.300> a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
four-star Colossus summer use a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.560 
four-star Colossus summer use a
three-star<00:02:34.780> Colossus<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.390> to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
three-star Colossus and that's just to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.440 
three-star Colossus and that's just to
keep<00:02:37.660> your<00:02:37.810> comparison<00:02:38.380> between<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
keep your comparison between the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.370 
keep your comparison between the
unstoppable<00:02:40.450> version<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.050> normal

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
unstoppable version and the normal

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.580 
unstoppable version and the normal
version<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.860> Colossus<00:02:42.430> oh<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:44.200> great<00:02:44.380> this

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
version of Colossus oh that's great this

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.370 
version of Colossus oh that's great this
match<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.130> afflict<00:02:45.459> right<00:02:45.610> now<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.840> has<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
match that afflict right now it has the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.050 
match that afflict right now it has the
cosmic<00:02:47.920> electron<00:02:48.250> rune<00:02:48.400> which<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.850> what

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
cosmic electron rune which is what

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.400 
cosmic electron rune which is what
magneto<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> be<00:02:49.900> based<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.230> I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
magneto is going to be based on I

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.320 
magneto is going to be based on I
believe<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.550> we're<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:52.209> running

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
believe so we're going to be running

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.750 
believe so we're going to be running
that<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.930> might<00:02:53.830> let<00:02:53.980> him<00:02:54.100> kick<00:02:54.400> my<00:02:54.520> ass<00:02:54.730> a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
that I might let him kick my ass a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.330 
that I might let him kick my ass a
little<00:02:54.940> bit<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.240> throw<00:02:55.420> me<00:02:55.540> around<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.950> yeah

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
little bit and throw me around so yeah

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.490 
little bit and throw me around so yeah
now<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.550> start<00:02:57.940> off<00:02:58.000> first<00:02:58.600> with<00:02:58.930> talking<00:02:59.440> about

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
now I start off first with talking about

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.250 
now I start off first with talking about
Colossus<00:03:00.070> my<00:03:00.790> Colossus<00:03:01.209> has<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.630> passive<00:03:02.080> which

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
Colossus my Colossus has a passive which

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.710 
Colossus my Colossus has a passive which
is<00:03:02.440> when<00:03:02.830> he<00:03:02.920> gets<00:03:03.130> hit<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:04.120> didn't<00:03:04.360> work<00:03:04.510> that

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
is when he gets hit it didn't work that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.110 
is when he gets hit it didn't work that
time<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.050> when<00:03:05.170> he<00:03:05.230> does<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.560> hit<00:03:05.739> his<00:03:06.730> armor

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
time but when he does get hit his armor

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.320 
time but when he does get hit his armor
does<00:03:07.420> go<00:03:07.570> up<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.010> did<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.850> awakened<00:03:10.209> one

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
does go up and did the awakened one

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.199 
does go up and did the awakened one
which<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:11.250> his<00:03:12.250> armor<00:03:12.640> goes<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:13.000> and

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
which I have his armor goes up and

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.840 
which I have his armor goes up and
stacks<00:03:13.720> infinitely<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.459> now<00:03:15.489> I'm<00:03:15.820> just

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
stacks infinitely so for now I'm just

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.940 
stacks infinitely so for now I'm just
gonna<00:03:16.060> punch<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.410> out<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.680> or<00:03:17.830> to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
gonna punch the out of this or to

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.400 
gonna punch the out of this or to
enroll<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:19.540> should<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:19.840> an<00:03:19.930> easy<00:03:20.050> kill

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
enroll and this should be an easy kill

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.440 
enroll and this should be an easy kill
because<00:03:21.340> our<00:03:21.519> own<00:03:21.670> rules<00:03:21.820> gonna<00:03:22.090> use<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
because our own rules gonna use the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.570 
because our own rules gonna use the
thought<00:03:22.870> specials<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:24.220> easy<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.430> get

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
thought specials so it's easy to get

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.190 
thought specials so it's easy to get
around<00:03:24.730> them<00:03:26.220> anyway

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.860 

just<00:03:31.860> walk<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.190> pretty<00:03:32.430> easily<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:33.510> yeah

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
just walk back pretty easily and yeah

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.790 
just walk back pretty easily and yeah
open<00:03:34.319> up<00:03:34.379> a<00:03:34.470> can<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.709> whoop<00:03:34.950> ass<00:03:35.099> I<00:03:36.739> don't<00:03:37.739> know

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
open up a can of whoop ass I don't know

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.040 
open up a can of whoop ass I don't know
if<00:03:38.069> many<00:03:38.970> people<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.480> playing<00:03:39.750> two<00:03:39.900> losses

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
if many people like playing two losses

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.690 
if many people like playing two losses
caused<00:03:40.319> his<00:03:40.440> damage<00:03:40.739> output<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.220> kind<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.550> low

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
caused his damage output is kind of low

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.990 
caused his damage output is kind of low
but<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.870> thing<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.140> he<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.739> tank<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:44.489> he<00:03:44.819> is

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
but the thing is he is a tank so he is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.850 
but the thing is he is a tank so he is
able<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.450> stand<00:03:45.989> there<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.260> take<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:46.830> of

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
able to stand there and take a lot of

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.920 
able to stand there and take a lot of
hits<00:03:47.129> let's<00:03:47.370> see<00:03:47.550> even<00:03:48.450> though<00:03:48.599> this<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.900> a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
hits let's see even though this is a

that's the end of this fight is pretty

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.219 
that's the end of this fight is pretty
clear<00:04:26.210> anyway<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.360> was<00:04:27.389> Colossus<00:04:27.990> now<00:04:28.169> the

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
clear anyway that was Colossus now the

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.830 
clear anyway that was Colossus now the
only<00:04:28.680> difference<00:04:29.070> between<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.840> Colossus

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
only difference between this Colossus

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.230 
only difference between this Colossus
and<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.169> unstoppable<00:04:31.800> Colossus<00:04:32.220> who<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:32.940> will

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
and the unstoppable Colossus who I will

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.629 
and the unstoppable Colossus who I will
awaken<00:04:33.600> soon<00:04:33.870> hopefully<00:04:34.229> with<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.800> alliance

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
awaken soon hopefully with this alliance

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.390 
awaken soon hopefully with this alliance
event<00:04:36.030> that's<00:04:36.180> active<00:04:36.479> right<00:04:36.600> now<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:38.370> only

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
event that's active right now the only

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.070 
event that's active right now the only
difference<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.120> signature<00:04:39.450> ability<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
difference is the signature ability and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320 
difference is the signature ability and
also<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.889> this<00:04:41.100> unstoppable<00:04:41.490> closest<00:04:42.090> gets

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
also that this unstoppable closest gets

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.230 
also that this unstoppable closest gets
fury<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.930> I'm<00:04:43.710> up<00:04:43.889> it's<00:04:44.370> not<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.940> arm<00:04:45.090> up

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
fury and I'm up it's not just the arm up

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.710 
fury and I'm up it's not just the arm up
that<00:04:45.450> he<00:04:45.539> gets<00:04:45.750> he<00:04:45.870> also<00:04:46.020> gets<00:04:46.289> fury<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:48.270> I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
that he gets he also gets fury so I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.650 
that he gets he also gets fury so I
don't<00:04:49.169> have<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.620> signature<00:04:50.250> unlock<00:04:50.669> yet<00:04:50.850> but<00:04:51.630> I

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
don't have a signature unlock yet but I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.210 
don't have a signature unlock yet but I
will<00:04:51.780> have<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.139> soon<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.740> will<00:04:52.860> probably<00:04:53.010> do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
will have it soon and I will probably do

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.320 
will have it soon and I will probably do
another<00:04:53.250> video<00:04:53.550> could<00:04:53.820> show<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.060> what<00:04:54.210> that's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330
