00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.470
 if we know that there is a polar wave me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.060
 find on facebook get in the 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.390
 twitter get into Argentine chefs 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.949
 dotcom and send us photos if it is 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.119
 snowing where I'm going 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.750
 I want to see snow please him and for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.270
 Of course, many months ago there were 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.430
 almost almost 200,000 people 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.740
 all next thousand people if you 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.379
 you can say each one and we raise the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 temperature and Mr. Alberto master 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.559
 where do you start with the issue of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.940
 good invoices to start we're going to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 start with the fat bill for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.139
 example and what we are going to do 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.909
 first of all you have to try to 

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:47.609
 start with everything that is liquid 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.280
 well liquid I mean for example 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.870
 Put water 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.870
 place the yeast 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:02.339
 saying if the generation of water 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.190
 we have 450 centimeters very little the 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.300
 go back to scoring pass all secrets 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.750
 so that people do not all go 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.050
 we totally put this sugar in this 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050
 case 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.260
 all right 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:29.900
 50 millimeters of oil for blacks 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.900
 we put the salt with flour 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 and we would be using only about 500 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.149
 flour flour master grams for the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 fat bill does not have to have 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.470
 a lot of strength and in this case we use 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.290
 Sabine 40 can be a mixture 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.170
 also 4 073 but not only 3 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 because the flour of 30 would let us know 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.030
 an overly chubby bill and the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 fat bills are commonly 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.270
 finite then so you do not have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 too much force the flour of 40 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:12.090
 perfect what we 're going to try to leave 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.489
 the basic mass to make invoice for 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.739
 fat beyond the decorations towards 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.230
 above you put quince on it or you put it more 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.790
 have whatever and this is a basis 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.790
 true 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.799
 an advanced basic base is cited to which 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.660
 from here we can take the 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:34.540
 watchful we take this sacrament 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.540
 and the sacraments the mind 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.030
 with tomato 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.030
 to compete 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.080
 in any case with a little sweet of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.080
 quince 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.750
 you will have the best bill in the world 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.720
 this mass that we have here is 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.280
 practically a pizza dough 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.349
 we could tell you if I did not have so much 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.060
 too much but we could say 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.069
 which is a pizza dough is due 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 Knead very well you have to give us a 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.780
 smooth well smooth mass 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.170
 I want to know all the secrets of 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.300
 alberto kneading 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.540
 we want to know everything alberto everything 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.230
 we are looking but very attentive alberto 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.230
 registering all the same 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.230
 Thank you 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.829
 more than 20 years ago we are going to do 30 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.890
 30 years 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.819
 Alberto has something like 55 almost like 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.159
 I 52 52 years old have children have grandchildren and 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.060
 is a master pastry baker of 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.060
 broad trajectory 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:09.070
 we had churros with salmon and greater 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:13.610
 voltage 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.650
 we are taking eight in the morning to your 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.780
 home 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:31.070
 one day in the afternoon 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:31.070
 and this is good 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.850
 I would like dona if she deserves 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.889
 it may cost but repeat the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.230
 ingredients of this basic dough made 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.870
 by absolutely handmade hands 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.440
 and professionals , Mr. Alberto for the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.630
 better bills these fat bills 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.910
 exact and the amount of low amount 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.500
 to write down the whole world first 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.050
 mix the liquids of certain slow or 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.140
 such as first liquid 450 centimeters 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.260
 cubic of water 50 cubic centimeters 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.930
 of oil 20 grams of salt that 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.870
 mixed with 500 grams of flour and the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.400
 yeast that in this case was very little 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.030
 yeast you put him when he was half 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030
 mixed with water 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:32.509
 I really did not hear the subject of fat 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.509
 when the fat enters 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.560
 but do visit me for a while 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.850
 I guess you have to add the fat 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.680
 but in the meantime I'm going to take it to 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.020
 go around like this if we have 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.100
 here the habit of showing and with much 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.100
 pride the argentine industry
