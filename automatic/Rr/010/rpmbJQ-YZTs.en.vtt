fast lap which you know I got my first

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.260 
fast lap which you know I got my first
pole<00:01:05.100> position<00:01:05.610> which<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> lot<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
pole position which was a lot of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
pole position which was a lot of
confidence<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> knew<00:01:07.680> sunday<00:01:08.100> was

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
confidence for me but we knew sunday was

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
confidence for me but we knew sunday was
going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> complete<00:01:09.090> different<00:01:09.570> gaming

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
going to be a complete different gaming

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410 
going to be a complete different gaming
you<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.520> wasn't<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> win

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you that we wasn't really going to win

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
you that we wasn't really going to win
the<00:01:12.570> race<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.170> knew<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.380> could<00:01:13.680> probably

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the race but we knew we could probably

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
the race but we knew we could probably
fight<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> podium<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.240> even<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
fight for a podium and even that was a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
fight for a podium and even that was a
bit<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> higher<00:01:16.830> expectation<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.060> we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
bit of a higher expectation than what we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.280 
bit of a higher expectation than what we
we<00:01:18.869> sort<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.140> got<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> learned<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:21.540> sort<00:01:22.200> of

we sort of got you learned that sort of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.080 
we sort of got you learned that sort of

doing<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> 26<00:02:54.140> laps<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.769> already<00:02:54.950> feel

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
doing the 26 laps and you already feel

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.940 
doing the 26 laps and you already feel
bit<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> limit<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.660> think<00:02:56.900> do<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.049> try<00:02:57.799> and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
bit on the limit you think do I try and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.830 
bit on the limit you think do I try and
catch<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.370> two-second<00:02:59.060> lead<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.480> possibly

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
catch a two-second lead and possibly

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.240 
catch a two-second lead and possibly
crash<00:03:00.110> or<00:03:00.350> should<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.560> start<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
crash or should I just start off for the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.880 
crash or should I just start off for the
20<00:03:01.580> points<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.049> race<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.560> know<00:03:03.590> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
20 points and in that race you know it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.650 
20 points and in that race you know it
wasn't<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.310> swagger<00:03:04.610> lead<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.209> was<00:03:05.330> robot

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
wasn't a swagger lead and it was robot

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.870 
wasn't a swagger lead and it was robot
so<00:03:05.900> for<00:03:06.110> me<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.440> was<00:03:06.530> better<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.890> save<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.580> 20

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
so for me it was better to save to 20

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.090 
so for me it was better to save to 20
points<00:03:08.090> try<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.110> get<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.440> bit<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.890> gap

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
points try and get a bit of a gap

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.949 
points try and get a bit of a gap
between<00:03:10.250> me<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.760> swagger<00:03:11.060> because<00:03:11.480> he's

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
between me and a swagger because he's

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.449 
between me and a swagger because he's
not<00:03:12.200> out<00:03:12.380> for<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.709> season<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.190> know<00:03:13.220> he's

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
not out for this season you know he's

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.009 
not out for this season you know he's
going<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.700> start<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.060> come<00:03:14.239> strong<00:03:14.540> again<00:03:14.840> it's

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
going to start to come strong again it's

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.830 
going to start to come strong again it's
just<00:03:15.140> got<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.470> find<00:03:15.620> his<00:03:15.830> way<00:03:15.980> around<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.580> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
just got to find his way around it and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.479 
just got to find his way around it and
you<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.959> think<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.620> far<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:19.040> played<00:03:19.280> it

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
you know I think so far we played it

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.930 
you know I think so far we played it
really<00:03:19.880> well<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.920> know<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:22.070> lot<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.370> people<00:03:22.459> say

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
really well I know a lot of people say

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.060 
really well I know a lot of people say
that<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.209> wasn't<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.690> mashup<00:03:24.049> contender<00:03:24.709> getting

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
that I wasn't a mashup contender getting

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.940 
that I wasn't a mashup contender getting
the<00:03:25.190> preseason<00:03:26.140> but<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.290> wasn't<00:03:27.620> really<00:03:27.650> as

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
the preseason but it wasn't really as

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.530 
the preseason but it wasn't really as
strong<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> seasons<00:03:28.880> before<00:03:29.030> because<00:03:29.510> I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
strong as the seasons before because I

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.509 
strong as the seasons before because I
wasn't<00:03:30.019> always<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.680> front<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.040> testing

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
wasn't always in the front and testing

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.390 
wasn't always in the front and testing
which<00:03:31.640> was<00:03:31.790> part<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.390> strategy<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:33.019> know

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
which was part of the strategy you know

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.920 
which was part of the strategy you know
but<00:03:34.400> yeah<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.940> few<00:03:35.209> races<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.660> gone<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:35.900> a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930
