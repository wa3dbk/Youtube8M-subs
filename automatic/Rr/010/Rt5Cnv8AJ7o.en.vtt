stands for what precipitated the pain we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
stands for what precipitated the pain we
can<00:01:08.490> ask<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> patient<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.930> were<00:01:09.990> doing

an adult without cognitive impairments

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.890 
an adult without cognitive impairments
we<00:02:59.040> frequently<00:02:59.400> use<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.880> universal<00:03:00.660> pain

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
we frequently use the universal pain

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.520 
we frequently use the universal pain
scale<00:03:01.320> being<00:03:01.620> zero<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.820> ten<00:03:03.150> zero<00:03:04.080> being<00:03:04.380> no

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
scale being zero to ten zero being no

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.820 
scale being zero to ten zero being no
pain<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:05.340> ten<00:03:05.760> being<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> most<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.840> intense

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.850 
pain and ten being the most or intense
pain<00:03:08.250> or<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.060> worst<00:03:09.270> pain<00:03:09.690> imaginable<00:03:09.900> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
pain or the worst pain imaginable and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.520 
pain or the worst pain imaginable and
again<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.730> ask<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> patient<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.750> go<00:03:12.960> ahead<00:03:13.080> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
again we ask the patient to go ahead and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.730 
again we ask the patient to go ahead and
indicate<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.810> addition<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.470> would<00:03:16.650> at

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
indicate that in addition I would at

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.470 
indicate that in addition I would at
this<00:03:16.890> point<00:03:17.040> indicate<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:18.030> only<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.450> it

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
this point indicate not only is it

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.360 
this point indicate not only is it
important<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.140> determine<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.740> severity<00:03:20.220> of

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
important to determine the severity of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.420 
important to determine the severity of
the<00:03:20.520> pain<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.540> also<00:03:22.220> important<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.250> we

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
the pain but it's also important that we

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.180 
the pain but it's also important that we
ask<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.000> patient<00:03:24.240> what<00:03:24.570> is<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.930> tolerable<00:03:25.920> or

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
ask the patient what is a tolerable or

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.970 
ask the patient what is a tolerable or
acceptable<00:03:26.880> level<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.570> pain<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:28.200> them<00:03:28.350> this

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
acceptable level of pain for them this

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.280 
acceptable level of pain for them this
is<00:03:29.040> important<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.910> terms<00:03:30.210> of<00:03:30.480> establishing

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is important in terms of establishing

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.070 
is important in terms of establishing
the<00:03:31.530> goals<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.100> outcomes<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.390> effective

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the goals and outcomes to be effective

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.890 
the goals and outcomes to be effective
and<00:03:34.260> managing<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.950> individual's<00:03:35.610> pain<00:03:35.970> the

and managing the individual's pain the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.230 
and managing the individual's pain the
tea<00:03:37.140> finally<00:03:37.710> in<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> mnemonic<00:03:38.220> stands<00:03:38.880> for

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
tea finally in this mnemonic stands for

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.350 
tea finally in this mnemonic stands for
timing<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.440> with<00:03:40.680> regard<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.190> timing<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.090> want

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
timing so with regard to timing we want

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.450 
timing so with regard to timing we want
to<00:03:42.540> know<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:43.050> terms<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.710> certain<00:03:44.100> time<00:03:44.430> of

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
to know in terms of a certain time of

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.240 
to know in terms of a certain time of
day<00:03:44.700> does<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.810> occur<00:03:46.230> there<00:03:46.530> pain<00:03:46.830> occur

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
day does this occur there pain occur

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.910 
day does this occur there pain occur
with<00:03:47.520> regard<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.230> ambulation<00:03:49.230> or<00:03:49.590> mobility

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
with regard to ambulation or mobility

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.330 
with regard to ambulation or mobility
does<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.000> occur<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.450> relation<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.050> meals<00:03:52.500> etc

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
does it occur in relation to meals etc

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.060 
does it occur in relation to meals etc
again<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.240> is<00:03:54.450> going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> help<00:03:55.110> us<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.620> terms

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
again this is going to help us in terms

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.030 
again this is going to help us in terms
of<00:03:56.370> determining<00:03:57.240> appropriate<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.740> effective
