 It floated to a scant ten meters

 send to the toxicological institute where 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.700
 Accredit exactly what kind of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.590
 substance is treated although everything points to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.270
 that the cause of the spill was a 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 boat that in your sail near big 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.020
 The Canary Islands have decided to carry out a 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.290
 illegal cleaning of the area located under 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 the machine room named in vat 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.040
 where oils are collected and others 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.110
 liquids all this crap called 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.210
 slope has to be retired in port to 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.189
 its treatment and elimination what 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.189
 it seems it must not have happened in this 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.719
 occasion, this same cause is attributed to 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.850
 spill that appeared in the south of the 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.470
 island a few months ago 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.450
 a sea rescue vessel 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.880
 has tried unsuccessfully to push back 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.770
 the stain by spinning the boat 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 in the vicinity to divert your

 course and avoid thus touch earth 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.310
 the divers that were in the

 place and many others who have heard 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.609
 the alarm voice on social networks 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.799
 his colleagues have gone there 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.600
 for with his own hands proceed to the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.070
 collection of the viscous pitcher that in 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.530
 some areas has exceeded several 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.479
 centimeters thick once 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.369
 organized they have armed themselves with sticks sacks 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.500
 and meshes to try to filter the biggest 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.299
 amount of tar possible while 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100
 it still remained in the form of cookies in 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.840
 the puddles but when the tide goes up 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.250
 it has been fixed to the rocks so 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.409
 they have had to use their 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.969
 hands to try to pick it up 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.349
 once filled in the garbage bags 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.750
 and large buckets have been depositing 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.189
 part of the click on the sand to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.349
 able to manipulate it and proceed to its 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.060
 retired the councilor of beaches of 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.530
 agüimes juani martel that have turned to 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 the place to try to coordinate the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.220
 cleaning operations of the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.989
 approximately 25 municipal workers 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.849
 of tracks and works in parks and gardens 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.519
 that together with civil protection of agüimes 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.170
 they have joined the unpleasant labor 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.940
 Martel did not explain that with all 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 probability the origin of the spill is 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.120
 a boat that has cleaned the room 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.860
 machines and warned that these labors 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.670
 are prohibited and can not be 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.989
 allow 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.579
 On the other hand he explained that it is still 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.709
 soon to make a final assessment 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.460
 of the damage since there is still fuel in the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.380
 sea 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.850
 moving south so it does not 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.680
 it is discarded to have to close some 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.500
 beach like bastard or any of the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.000
 of Arinaga that could be affected 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 It highlighted the wound and increases it 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.050
 the importance that this area of ​​the littoral 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.910
 have for diving and like many clubs 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.190
 and companies use this area for their 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.740
 great biodiversity as well as by the great 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.390
 cleaning and water quality so 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.730
 that could not have fallen in worse place 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.410
 this spill throughout the afternoon 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.150
 dozens of volunteers have worked in the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.070
 cleaning the area that with all 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.930
 probability will have to continue tomorrow 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.150
 since the discharge is quite 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.200
 scope and affected for the moment 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.210
 a strip of the coast of 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.310
 about a kilometer that also 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.200
 could be increased since there is still 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.320
 a large oil slick floating in 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.320
 the sea
