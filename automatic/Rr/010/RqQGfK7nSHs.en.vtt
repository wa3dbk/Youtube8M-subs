 get to know one of the vehicles 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.110
 commercial symbol of strength efficiency 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.260
 and robustness 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.869
 after launching lantos in 2012 for 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.730
 heavy distribution in 2011 la

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.460
 stands out in the competitive landscape 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.410
 for absolute eco-compatibility and for 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.930
 its technical characteristics with

 off-road performance and allows 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.350
 very high loads with sustained gear 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 even on very demanding routes 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.090
 ensuring excellent behavior e 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.099
 maximum performance in terms of
