come towards the ball with an open

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
come towards the ball with an open
racquet<00:00:15.089> face<00:00:15.240> which<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.929> look<00:00:16.080> like

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
racquet face which is going to look like

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.429 
racquet face which is going to look like
this<00:00:16.609> the<00:00:17.609> racket<00:00:17.970> face<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.180> open<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.869> moving

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
this the racket face is open and moving

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.769 
this the racket face is open and moving
towards<00:00:19.740> contact<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.630> good

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
towards contact all the really good

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
towards contact all the really good
servers<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.439> other<00:00:22.650> hand<00:00:22.920> come<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.490> with

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
servers on the other hand come in with

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
servers on the other hand come in with
the<00:00:23.820> edge<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> racket<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the edge of the racket so it's going to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
the edge of the racket so it's going to
look<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> edge<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> racket<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
look like this the edge of the racket is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
look like this the edge of the racket is
coming<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.890> square<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
coming up and then they square the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
coming up and then they square the
racket<00:00:29.730> face<00:00:29.939> towards<00:00:30.510> contact<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> keeps

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
racket face towards contact and it keeps

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.880 
racket face towards contact and it keeps
turning<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:32.040> after<00:00:32.610> contact<00:00:33.350> now<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> reason

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
turning out after contact now the reason

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.229 
turning out after contact now the reason
for<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> movement<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
for that is that the movement that I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
for that is that the movement that I
just<00:00:36.480> showed<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.930> where<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.260> come<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
just showed you where you come in with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
just showed you where you come in with
the<00:00:37.950> edge<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:39.059> turn<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> racket<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the edge and then turn out the racket is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
the edge and then turn out the racket is
called<00:00:41.100> pronation<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
called pronation and it is one of the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
called pronation and it is one of the
main<00:00:42.690> power<00:00:42.960> sources<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> serve<00:00:44.600> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
main power sources on the serve the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
main power sources on the serve the
first<00:00:45.780> thing<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.800> check<00:00:47.039> your

first thing you need to do is check your

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
first thing you need to do is check your
grip<00:00:47.460> though<00:00:47.750> ideally<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.289> a

of<00:00:55.739> players<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> problem<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> they

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
of players have the problem that they

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
of players have the problem that they
have<00:00:57.180> too<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> forehand<00:00:58.230> grip<00:00:58.440> over

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
have too much of a forehand grip over

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.920 
have too much of a forehand grip over
this<00:00:59.579> way<00:01:01.070> if<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.149> too<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this way if you have too much of a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.080 
this way if you have too much of a
forehand<00:01:04.409> grip<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> racket<00:01:05.670> face<00:01:05.850> will

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
forehand grip then the racket face will

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020 
forehand grip then the racket face will
open<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.540> automatically<00:01:07.490> now<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
open up automatically now let's have a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
open up automatically now let's have a
look<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.330> two<00:01:09.510> serves<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.350> where<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> lead<00:01:10.770> with

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
look at two serves one where I lead with

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
look at two serves one where I lead with
the<00:01:11.070> edge<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> racket<00:01:12.630> faces

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the edge and one where the racket faces

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.249 
the edge and one where the racket faces
to<00:01:13.110> open<00:01:13.700> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.450> video<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> left

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to open in the video on the left

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.780 
to open in the video on the left
I<00:01:16.350> hit<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.650> regular<00:01:17.040> serve<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I hit my regular serve with a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.359 
I hit my regular serve with a
continental<00:01:18.509> grip<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> video<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
continental grip in the video on the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.280 
continental grip in the video on the
right<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> used<00:01:20.820> more<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.450> forehand<00:01:21.869> grip<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
right I used more of a forehand grip and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
right I used more of a forehand grip and
simulated<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> typical<00:01:23.549> serve<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> rather

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
simulated a typical serve with a rather

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.370 
simulated a typical serve with a rather
open<00:01:24.960> racket<00:01:25.380> face<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.259> on

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
open racket face as you can see here on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
open racket face as you can see here on
the<00:01:28.500> left<00:01:28.680> side<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> edge<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.640> racket<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the left side the edge of my racket is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
the left side the edge of my racket is
roughly<00:01:30.720> pointing<00:01:31.200> towards<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> ball<00:01:32.150> from

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
roughly pointing towards the ball from

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
roughly pointing towards the ball from
this<00:01:33.360> position<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.229> pronate<00:01:34.680> my

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this position I can then pronate my

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.740 
this position I can then pronate my
forearm<00:01:35.280> which<00:01:35.670> allows<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> generate<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
forearm which allows me to generate a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.710 
forearm which allows me to generate a
lot<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> racket<00:01:37.619> head<00:01:37.740> speed<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:39.540> right

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
lot of racket head speed on the right

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
lot of racket head speed on the right
side<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> racket<00:01:41.130> face<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
side you can see that the racket face is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160 
side you can see that the racket face is
much<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.880> open<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> strings<00:01:42.930> are

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
much more open and the strings are

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.340 
much more open and the strings are
roughly<00:01:43.470> pointing<00:01:43.950> towards<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> ball<00:01:45.320> now<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
roughly pointing towards the ball now I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
roughly pointing towards the ball now I
have<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> whole

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
have a look one more time at the whole

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
have a look one more time at the whole
sequence

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.950 

you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.600 

usually<00:02:05.960> two<00:02:06.350> things<00:02:06.650> happen<00:02:07.100> when<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.430> come

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
usually two things happen when you come

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.279 
usually two things happen when you come
towards<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.030> ball<00:02:08.240> with<00:02:08.450> an<00:02:08.569> open<00:02:08.899> racquet

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
towards the ball with an open racquet

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.920 
towards the ball with an open racquet
face<00:02:09.470> number<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:11.000> will<00:02:11.150> lack<00:02:11.330> racket<00:02:11.780> hit

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
face number one you will lack racket hit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.930 
face number one you will lack racket hit
speed<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.380> therefore<00:02:12.590> power<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.280> your<00:02:13.400> serve

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
speed and therefore power on your serve

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.630 
speed and therefore power on your serve
number<00:02:14.810> two<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.709> tend<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.010> miss<00:02:16.280> balls

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
number two you will tend to miss balls

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.080 
number two you will tend to miss balls
long<00:02:17.030> because<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.720> open<00:02:17.989> racket<00:02:18.349> face<00:02:19.090> all

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
long because of the open racket face all

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.610 
long because of the open racket face all
right<00:02:20.300> guys<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.840> open<00:02:21.080> racket<00:02:21.410> face<00:02:21.590> is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
right guys the open racket face is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.199 
right guys the open racket face is
definitely<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.610> most<00:02:22.760> common

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
definitely one of the most common

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.580 
definitely one of the most common
problems<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.780> see<00:02:23.959> on<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> serve<00:02:24.380> and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
problems that I see on the serve and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.960 
problems that I see on the serve and
therefore<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> highly<00:02:25.310> recommend<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.819> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
therefore I highly recommend that you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.090 
therefore I highly recommend that you
check<00:02:26.090> your<00:02:26.360> own<00:02:26.540> serve<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.350> make<00:02:27.680> sure<00:02:27.890> that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
check your own serve and make sure that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.900 
check your own serve and make sure that
you<00:02:28.250> lead<00:02:28.489> with<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> edge

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
you lead with the edge

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.729 
you lead with the edge
