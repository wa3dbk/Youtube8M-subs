00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.700
 hi kitchens today we have a post from 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 prefect a poster does not need oven that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.820
 we only need 10 minutes to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 also prepare a cheesecake 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
 super romantic the one that knows about 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.600
 these valentine dates though 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 you can do it all year round and great 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.420
 of course so nothing to see if you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.300
 like we start we're going to need 200 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 grams of Greek yogurt 150 grams of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.420
 creamy cheese 150 grams of fruits 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 forest 80 grams of cookies 3 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.120
 tablespoons of sugar and 20 grams of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 pistachios 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.000
 we mix in a bowl the Greek yogurt 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000
 the Philadelphia cheese 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 and the sugar 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.649
 and beat vigorously until you're 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.649
 well integrated 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.420
 It is important that we get lumps 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.420
 let's throw some muscle 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.200
 and it's ready, all that's left is to mount the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.630
 dish we are going to use some 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.010
 cocktail glasses because they are like 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 national is love in times we think 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.180
 something more beautiful and special simply 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.260
 what we would do is to lay a foundation 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.510
 cookie 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.830
 the kingdom of another cheese cake and some 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.710
 fruits in this case we have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 caught raspberry of blackberry why that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.840
 it is an aphrodisiac 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 susan valentine is the day he plays not the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.380
 we ride 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.390
 it is not necessary that the crushed with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.970
 nothing with the hand break quite well 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 choose the cookies that we like the most 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 can be in this case are from 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.740
 oats but can invade something kind 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.430
 digestive marie or even chocolate 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.430
 if you are sweet 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.400
 made a few tablespoons do not be 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.330
 scarce with Luciano always 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.210
 Be careful not to stain the glass or anything 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.760
 then we throw our 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.810
 handbags 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.810
 and we're dying 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.520
 and to give a crunchy touch I like 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.390
 Put some pistachios chopped also 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.150
 you can use chocolate chips 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 and I would only be able to serve you I give you one 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 presentation suggestion for 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.200
 increase the aphrodisiac effect of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.170
 raspberries 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.030
 you can serve it in underwear or if not 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.220
 you know with a glass of champagne too 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.440
 It's going very well if you liked the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.790
 recipe do not forget to give me like and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.440
