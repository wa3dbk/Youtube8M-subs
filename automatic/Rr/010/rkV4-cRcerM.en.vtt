00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.650 

this<00:00:09.360> will<00:00:09.540> be<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:09.809> first<00:00:10.019> three<00:00:10.349> picture<00:00:11.660> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
this will be my first three picture and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.450 
this will be my first three picture and
apparently<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> crack<00:00:13.469> climbing<00:00:13.710> isn't<00:00:14.250> like

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
apparently the crack climbing isn't like

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.980 
apparently the crack climbing isn't like
that<00:00:14.880> easy<00:00:15.509> either<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:17.180> Alex<00:00:18.180> made<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that easy either so Alex made a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.010 
that easy either so Alex made a
suggestion<00:00:19.470> saying<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> it'll<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
suggestion saying that it'll be a

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.220 
suggestion saying that it'll be a
life-changing<00:00:22.020> experience<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:24.230> guess

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
life-changing experience so I guess

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200 
life-changing experience so I guess
that's<00:00:25.350> why<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that's why I'm going to go for it or I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
that's why I'm going to go for it or I
may<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:27.960> stuck<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.010> be

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
may just get stuck up there and be

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
may just get stuck up there and be
crippled<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.000> come<00:00:30.330> back<00:00:30.480> old<00:00:30.720> bloodied<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
crippled and come back old bloodied and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.459 
crippled and come back old bloodied and
stuff<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.180> that<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.360> life-affirming<00:00:33.960> as

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
stuff but that can be life-affirming as

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.459 
stuff but that can be life-affirming as
well<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> anything<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.600> good<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.110> might
