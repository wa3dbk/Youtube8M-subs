00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 I spoke with rodrigo so every photo 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.759
 dot com 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.310
 I'm here in Norway that came nei 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.680
 winter cold temperature ashamed 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 I have the tripod that wants to take some 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.570
 Interesting long exposure photos 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.369
 during the day so this is the best 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 The place I think of a photo is usually 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 where water has flowing and flowing is the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.350
 trying to keep talking the video here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.200
 already completely frozen in the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 Belt my side do not feel me in the pee but 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 finally everybody in the camera today a filter of 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.230
 neder neutral city nÃ© on the camera that is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 basically a child you put to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.539
 darken a little since beyond the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 exposure during the day is having too much light 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.980
 now then just leave one of these with 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 now it's all white photo 7 that goes 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 have lots of light 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 then this other day in the neutral city and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.400
 darkens the lens then it gets dark but 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.710
 that we put in the talent then 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.619
 decreases the incidence of light naturally 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.720
 There you go to take pictures and more and more. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
 long exposure month during the day 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 when there is plenty of light 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 so country pec is very important I'm going 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.369
 take a legal back up photo of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.040
 here runs a nice way, so it's 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 That's right, the cold has to use the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 creativity yes and this version of the movie 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 event in the city 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 I am using is the name of 400 case 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 Someone wants to because they have already searched for 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.630
 there is a very simple thing we 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.180
 facilitate a new one is a new tool 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.310
 the creative arsenal right? 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.590
 to take pictures of the mission and position 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.049
 during the day so I'll put a photo 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 take it out later then no 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.250
 in the sequence the video is right is the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 brain is freezing here so do not 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 I can not even speak right, but 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.229
 I want all this suffering worth the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 feather 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.619
 worth every photo with the oxygen there is the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 of photography in practice and without 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.290
 stick ok 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 and also the channel on youtube that the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.910
 and finally can not order everything here from 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.410
