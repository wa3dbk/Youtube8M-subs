00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
 have 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.059
 people and demand the mere laugh but total 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.430
 from youtube welcome to the first 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.160
 chapter of nerd r I walk the section more 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.840
 heck of this channel we have decided to create 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.150
 this section to bring the best 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.490
 curiosities of the film world 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.859
 video games and some other subject that we 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.599
 occur in the future to inaugurate this 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.369
 section we decided to talk about one of 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.410
 the villains they should fear the most 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.880
 of the world of comics and is that already 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 comes for the new movie of the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.450
 avengers ap yours jason a lot of people are 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 have to ask what would you recommend 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.440
 read to understand this movie 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.149
 Well basically you do not have to know 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.890
 all about the troll 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.590
 if you read the coolest of a throne and if 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.940
 you compare it with the movie 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.520
 you would probably hate her or the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.539
 movie or the comic though the safest 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.489
 is that you end up hating the movie 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.949
 so better when you go see it 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.780
 relax from the movie with the idea that 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.910
 It is an alternate universe to that of comics 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.620
 but if you are one of those fools who 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.120
 you want to know what's wrong with this villain 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.040
 Well here I give you the most 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.040
 relevant ultra see 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.130
 the throne was created by the screenwriter roy 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.720
 thomas and drawn by jon busch emma in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 1958 made its first appearance as the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 Inca pucha do carme if in the beginning 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.090
 member of a known organization 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.070
 as the masters of evil 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.920
 we can see all this in the number 54 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 the avengers the throne was built by 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.440
 the doctor hanks tim or the ant man 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.700
 or giant man or yellow jackets depending 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.190
 the date on which you will place it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.600
 this robot was created by ping when 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.250
 I was experimenting in robotics 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.900
 high intelligence at first the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.340
 goal of the throne was to seek peace in 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.470
 the world but being an intelligence 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.840
 artificial super developed with the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 time was revealed and with its superpower 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.400
 duper ultra special mega the encephalon 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 satin is a power that allows you 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.940
 control organic matter with it 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.620
 attacked pink and made the dow that 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 forget all about creating a 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.450
 Throne throne immediately began 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.280
 improve in its rudimentary design happened 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.320
 of being an old-fashioned and conventional robot 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.850
 to a humanoid-shaped robot and so on 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.130
 he began to update himself several 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.960
 occasions during this process too 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 would have important battles against 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.430
 avengers in fact every one that was 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 defeated he came back with something like 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.400
 an updated 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 hardware making it impossible to defeat him 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.569
 as before at first its 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.010
 exoskeleton was simple metal but 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.569
 how was the time passing 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.250
 first he got an alloy of 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.470
 adamantium until you get to a material 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.569
 indestructible called vibran yum is a 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.579
 metal alloy much more powerful than 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.140
 the adamantium itself the throne is 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.730
 he turned against his creator because he thought 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.290
 that the only way to bring peace to the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.150
 earth was if the human race was 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.159
 destroyed he believes that humans are 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.450
 inferiors and is dedicated to eliminate everything 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.010
 what he believes is inferior in the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.810
 world besides that has latent 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.030
 goal of trying to eliminate your 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.010
 creator this villain gives a little scary 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.139
 apart from making him almost indestructible 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.459
 has the ability to be omnipresent or 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.859
 be in different places at the same 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.000
 time has an intelligence superior to 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.069
 the one of any human 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.750
 obvious is a machine he updates 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.639
 every one who is defeated collects a 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.159
 impressive amount of data doing 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.439
 possible that he can create plans that 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.030
 are almost unstoppable he can transfer 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.980
 your mind to any other of your bodies 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.810
 is a virus that is capable of infecting 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.599
 any other machine and make a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.670
 machine does not tire many times 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.680
 has been arrested but not defeated by 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.359
 your mind since it is in a kind of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.940
 cloud what we know today as 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.440
 mega 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.090
 or mediafire or many of those servers 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.710
 and has a protocol so that in case of 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.260
 be defeated his creations what 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.880
 immediately rebuild all this what 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 makes him one of the most super villains 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.670
 fearsome of the universe of marvel now 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.210
 imagine if this is a troll 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.210
 imagine how it will be 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.830
 give us baby an important fact 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.290
 school throne has created life 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.000
 one of these creations was vision is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.099
 a mixture of organic tissue from the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.099
 human torch and mind of the superhero 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.870
 wonder man in the beginning vision would be 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.790
 the weapon that the throne would use against hank 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.549
 but vision was revealed and time later 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.349
 He joined the avengers and he's a 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.330
 deltron song like to satisfy the 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.129
 need to have a partner but 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.930
 he also rebelled against was now that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.310
 we will see avenger 6 or fulton 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.989
 it should be clarified here that it is nothing 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.060
 similar to the crossover of comics with 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.190
 the same name here will be modified on 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.229
 creator of the throne but you will be like 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.000
 the creator and not to hank we also 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.889
 we will see trips and temporary breaks 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.780
 as the crossover although of course it is 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.639
 we do not know if there will be temporary trips 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.380
 or something similar to that fulton 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.210
 because in fact in the trailer we reach 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.560
 to see the captain america as if he were traveling 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.180
 to the past at the time of the second 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.500
 world war but they are only 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.720
 speculations I have not seen the movie 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.270
 although it is already filtered and there are hundreds of 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.590
 spoilers but I have not done it not me 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.470
 I'm going to spoiler until we do the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.180
 review of wenger 6 fuld that by the way 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.039
 I recommend you read it only 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.169
 were 8 numbers and it is developed in a 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.439
 universe different from the usual 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.719
 verses and independent to 616 that is 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.370
 the classic universe now that you already know 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.719
 the main data of ultra we are going to 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.999
 talk about different versions 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.909
 that exist from this enemy we begin 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:11.800
 with the one throne of the universe 1610 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.360
 known as the ultimate universe here 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.129
 the throne is only a robot if it is not a 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.110
 program of some welded robots created 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.490
 for hank ping but the project was 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.020
 discarded because the robots are 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.360
 they came back against the ultimate and 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.699
 known as the avengers too 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.370
 I recommend reading origin of the turn that is 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.889
 the avenger number from 54 to 58 per 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.330
 roy thomas and jon look for more the turn a 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.159
 limit where the tron wants to destroy 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.469
 humanity and apart wants to populate the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.779
 earth with her annihilation clones with 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.800
 ultra test seeks to expand its control in 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.990
 the whole galaxy 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.370
 Jason filters where he ends up with all the 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.810
 heroes of the earth and the few 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.210
 leftovers have to travel in time 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.159
 to make hank never create a throne 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.349
 As I mentioned, it does not have much 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.029
 similarity because apart in the comic it comes out 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.830
 this wolverine comes out the invisible woman 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.560
 which implies having the rights of 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.110
 fox in the film universe and 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.969
 finally race of ultra if you are 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.500
 from mexico and I hope from latin america 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.569
 can look for a monster edition with what 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.370
 better from the throne to know more about the 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.439
 destructive power of this super villain 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.750
 good friends who thought this 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.189
 small special of nerd r 'is not the 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.779
 first broadcast and I hope you have them 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.060
 liked because we thought to do at least 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.620
 one a week or one every we can 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.029

 of cinema curiosity of videogames 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.199
 video game film errors and so on 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.210

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.770

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.300

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.189
