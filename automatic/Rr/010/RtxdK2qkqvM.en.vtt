as its rotating around its kind of a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
as its rotating around its kind of a

fundamental basic move of for 3d flight
the<00:00:32.099> problem<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.840> my<00:00:33.840> brain

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the problem with it is my brain

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990 
the problem with it is my brain
sometimes<00:00:34.710> doesn't<00:00:35.070> move<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.489> fast<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
sometimes doesn't move as fast as the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
sometimes doesn't move as fast as the
helicopter<00:00:36.480> does<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> older<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
helicopter does and the older I get the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.240 
helicopter does and the older I get the
more<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> find<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.430> true<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
more I find this to be true so I like to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.030 
more I find this to be true so I like to
slow<00:00:41.250> time<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> ways<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
slow time down so one of the ways that I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.650 
slow time down so one of the ways that I
can<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.879> by<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
can do this is by just going into the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
can do this is by just going into the
menu<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.379> physics<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.850> taking<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
menu here for physics and then taking a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.080 
menu here for physics and then taking a
look<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.870> options<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.350> available<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.920> me

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
look at what options are available to me

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.209 
look at what options are available to me
so<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.410> realistic

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so as you can see here in the realistic

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
so as you can see here in the realistic
mode<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.539> hundred<00:00:57.809> percent<00:00:57.840> physics

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
mode I have one hundred percent physics

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400 
mode I have one hundred percent physics
speed<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.129> flight<00:01:00.120> model<00:01:00.449> characteristics<00:01:01.320> are

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
speed a flight model characteristics are

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.799 
speed a flight model characteristics are
going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.710> realistic<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> no

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
going to be realistic and there is no

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.920 
going to be realistic and there is no
autopilot<00:01:04.290> assist<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> intermediate

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
autopilot assist so here in intermediate

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
autopilot assist so here in intermediate
mode<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> physics<00:01:08.460> speed<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
mode you can see the physics speed is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.160 
mode you can see the physics speed is
still<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.210> hundred<00:01:09.270> percent<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
still at one hundred percent but the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
still at one hundred percent but the
flight<00:01:10.470> model<00:01:10.860> setting<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
flight model setting is right in the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
flight model setting is right in the
middle<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.900> easy<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> realistic<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.430> means

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
middle of easy and realistic which means

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
middle of easy and realistic which means
some<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> aerodynamic<00:01:16.259> characteristics

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
some of the aerodynamic characteristics

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
some of the aerodynamic characteristics
might<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:17.909> bit<00:01:18.090> gentler<00:01:18.540> such<00:01:19.049> as

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
might be a little bit gentler such as

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
might be a little bit gentler such as
stall<00:01:19.500> speeds<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> things<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
stall speeds and things like that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
stall speeds and things like that
probably<00:01:21.390> less<00:01:21.540> noticeable<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> heli<00:01:22.439> than

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
probably less noticeable on a heli than

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.030 
probably less noticeable on a heli than
it<00:01:22.770> would<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.659> airplane<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:25.020> beginner<00:01:25.770> mode

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it would be a airplane in beginner mode

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120 
it would be a airplane in beginner mode
we<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.689> reduced<00:01:28.049> physic<00:01:28.619> speed<00:01:28.829> eighty

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
we have a reduced physic speed eighty

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
we have a reduced physic speed eighty
percent<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.549> our<00:01:29.670> speed<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.869> easy<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
percent of our speed a really easy to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.780 
percent of our speed a really easy to
fly<00:01:31.439> model<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> we've<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
fly model and we've also got a little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.120 
fly model and we've also got a little
autopilot<00:01:33.270> assist<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.009> like

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
autopilot assist which is kind of like

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
autopilot assist which is kind of like
self<00:01:35.430> leveling<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> tries<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> help<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
self leveling it it tries to help you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
self leveling it it tries to help you
keep<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> aircraft<00:01:37.799> level<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> like

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
keep the aircraft level so what I like

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.330 
keep the aircraft level so what I like
to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.840> start<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.259> realistic<00:01:40.740> mode<00:01:40.920> because

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to do is start in realistic mode because

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
to do is start in realistic mode because
I<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.090> heli<00:01:42.649> aerodynamics<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I want all of my heli aerodynamics to be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
I want all of my heli aerodynamics to be
realistic<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.329> move<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.899> speed

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
realistic and then I just move the speed

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
realistic and then I just move the speed
down<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> point<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> put

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
down so at this point I'm going to put

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
down so at this point I'm going to put
it<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.360> fifty<00:01:48.780> percent<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.890> just

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it to about fifty percent and it's just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
it to about fifty percent and it's just
basically<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> slow<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
basically going to slow how the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.030 
basically going to slow how the
helicopter<00:01:53.040> reacts<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.270> stick<00:01:54.720> inputs<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
helicopter reacts to my stick inputs and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
helicopter reacts to my stick inputs and
as<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.240> full<00:01:57.780> rudder

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
as you can see here I've got full rudder

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
as you can see here I've got full rudder
left<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.729> fast<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> sparrow

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
left and that's as fast as a sparrow

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
left and that's as fast as a sparrow
wedding<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.200> fifty<00:02:01.530> percent<00:02:01.829> speed

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
wedding it's at fifty percent speed

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
wedding it's at fifty percent speed
approximately<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.899> means<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:04.140> also<00:02:04.320> have

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
approximately but that means i also have

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.520 
approximately but that means i also have
time<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> think<00:02:05.189> about<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.969> moves<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.140> i<00:02:07.200> do

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
time to think about my moves as i do

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.979 
time to think about my moves as i do
them<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.450> also<00:02:09.720> give

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
them and you can see I can also give

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.860 
them and you can see I can also give
greater<00:02:10.319> stick<00:02:10.679> inputs<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.640> stick

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
greater stick inputs on the right stick

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.080 
greater stick inputs on the right stick
and<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.739> penalized<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.640> much<00:02:14.849> because

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and I'm not penalized as much because

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
and I'm not penalized as much because
everything's<00:02:15.599> at<00:02:15.720> half<00:02:15.930> speed<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.799> just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
everything's at half speed it just

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
everything's at half speed it just
allows<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.819> get<00:02:18.209> my<00:02:18.330> brain<00:02:18.810> around<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
allows me to get my brain around what I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.729 
allows me to get my brain around what I
want<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> do<00:02:20.099> or<00:02:20.700> pure<00:02:21.209> wedding<00:02:21.659> hover<00:02:22.110> you're

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
want to do or pure wedding hover you're

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.130 
want to do or pure wedding hover you're
basically<00:02:23.129> timing<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.239> orientation<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
basically timing the orientation of the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.490 
basically timing the orientation of the
tail<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.830> trying<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.879> your<00:02:27.629> adjustments

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
tail and trying to make your adjustments

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.860 
tail and trying to make your adjustments
consistently<00:02:29.340> at<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> certain<00:02:30.360> point<00:02:30.629> in<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
consistently at a certain point in the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.350 
consistently at a certain point in the
rotation<00:02:31.230> some<00:02:31.590> people<00:02:31.829> do<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.069> every<00:02:32.360> you

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
rotation some people do it every you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
rotation some people do it every you
know<00:02:33.390> two<00:02:33.540> points<00:02:34.019> in<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> full<00:02:34.379> rotation<00:02:34.530> some

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
know two points in a full rotation some

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680 
know two points in a full rotation some
people<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:35.310> one<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.909> depends<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.360> speed

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
people do one just depends on the speed

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.710 
people do one just depends on the speed
for<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> lot<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> people<00:02:37.799> but<00:02:38.250> I'd<00:02:39.030> any<00:02:39.209> rate<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
for a lot of people but I'd any rate it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.780 
for a lot of people but I'd any rate it
allows<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.500> ability<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.099> think<00:02:41.370> through

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
allows me the ability to think through

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
allows me the ability to think through
what<00:02:42.690> Corrections<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.440> need<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:44.450> now<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
what Corrections I need to do now you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.789 
what Corrections I need to do now you
don't<00:02:46.379> want<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> finish<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.280> practice<00:02:47.790> in

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
don't want to finish your practice in

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.319 
don't want to finish your practice in
reduced<00:02:49.799> speed<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.519> bump<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.879> back<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.209> to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
reduced speed so bump it back up to

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.180 
reduced speed so bump it back up to
realistic<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.799> get<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.950> feel

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
realistic because you want to get a feel

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.559 
realistic because you want to get a feel
for<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.519> hell<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.910> really<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.359> going<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
for how the hell you really is going to

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.180 
for how the hell you really is going to
react<00:02:54.780> now<00:02:55.379> look<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> difference<00:02:56.069> with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
react now look at the difference with

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.119 
react now look at the difference with
full<00:02:56.549> rudder<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:58.049> really<00:02:58.349> moving<00:02:58.709> so

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
full rudder it's it's really moving so

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.430 
full rudder it's it's really moving so
now<00:02:59.879> I<00:02:59.909> get<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.390> speed<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.810> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
now I get it to a speed that is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.759 
now I get it to a speed that is
reasonable<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.069> me<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:03.989> my<00:03:04.409> right

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
reasonable for me and and now my right

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.670 
reasonable for me and and now my right
stick<00:03:05.099> inputs<00:03:05.489> are<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:05.940> minimal<00:03:06.540> but<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> get

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
stick inputs are very minimal but I get

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800 
stick inputs are very minimal but I get
a<00:03:07.709> feel<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.220> real<00:03:08.430> heli<00:03:08.670> you'll<00:03:09.480> really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
a feel for the real heli you'll really

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.229 
a feel for the real heli you'll really
do<00:03:09.989> yourself<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.440> disservice<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.700> fly<00:03:12.030> your

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
do yourself a disservice if you fly your

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.660 
do yourself a disservice if you fly your
simulator<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.109> slow<00:03:13.859> speed<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.459> then<00:03:14.549> go<00:03:14.640> out

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
simulator in slow speed and then go out

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.900 
simulator in slow speed and then go out
and<00:03:14.790> fly<00:03:15.060> role<00:03:15.329> model<00:03:15.659> in<00:03:15.780> full<00:03:15.989> speed<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.530> will

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
and fly role model in full speed it will

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.909 
and fly role model in full speed it will
probably<00:03:17.910> shocked<00:03:18.419> you<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.349> cost<00:03:19.620> money

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
probably shocked you and in cost money

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.300 
probably shocked you and in cost money
so<00:03:20.329> at<00:03:21.329> any<00:03:21.450> rate<00:03:21.599> that's<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.739> another

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
so at any rate that's it just another

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.949 
so at any rate that's it just another
quick<00:03:23.549> tip<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.269> wanted<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.660> share<00:03:24.750> with

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
you and you know it's been helping me in

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.569 
you and you know it's been helping me in
my<00:03:28.019> practice<00:03:28.260> obviously<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:28.980> isn't<00:03:29.190> how<00:03:29.519> to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
my practice obviously this isn't how to

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.490 
my practice obviously this isn't how to
do<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> pure<00:03:30.480> wing<00:03:30.660> hover<00:03:30.900> video<00:03:31.260> there's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
do a pure wing hover video there's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.759 
do a pure wing hover video there's
plenty<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.769> other<00:03:32.030> great<00:03:33.139> video<00:03:34.139> instructors
