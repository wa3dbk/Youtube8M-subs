00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
resistances but overall like shuckle is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929 
resistances but overall like shuckle is
just<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> tanky

can just kind of see the main set is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
can just kind of see the main set is
going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.869> Chesto<00:01:19.560> Barry<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.130> contrary

possible by using shell smash normally
shell<00:01:27.509> smash<00:01:27.720> lowers<00:01:28.170> defense<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> special

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
shell smash lowers defense and special

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
shell smash lowers defense and special

defense by one with contrary it's going

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.569 
defense by one with contrary it's going
to<00:01:31.110> raise<00:01:31.350> those<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to raise those and that's also going to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
to raise those and that's also going to
drop<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:32.970> attack<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> special<00:01:34.140> attack<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
drop your attack and special attack and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
drop your attack and special attack and
speed<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:36.119> doesn't<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.659> matter<00:01:36.869> when

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
speed that doesn't really matter when

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
speed that doesn't really matter when
you're<00:01:37.259> dealing<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.650> ten<00:01:37.979> ten<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.579> five<00:01:38.759> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you're dealing with ten ten and five on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
you're dealing with ten ten and five on
the<00:01:39.119> base<00:01:39.270> stats<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.110> contraries<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.799> gonna

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the base stats so contraries just gonna

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
the base stats so contraries just gonna
be<00:01:41.009> free<00:01:41.340> defense<00:01:41.670> boost<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.180> already

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
be free defense boost and you already

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
be free defense boost and you already
have<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> stupid<00:01:43.290> amount<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> defenses<00:01:44.159> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
have a stupid amount of defenses so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
have a stupid amount of defenses so
you're<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.810> really

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you're really just going to get really

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
you're really just going to get really
really<00:01:46.560> tanky<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.369> once<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> break<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.970> down

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
really tanky like once you break it down

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
really tanky like once you break it down
after<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.960> twice<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
after you use it twice you're going to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
after you use it twice you're going to
be<00:01:49.799> over<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> thousand<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.970> both<00:01:51.149> defenses<00:01:51.630> with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
be over a thousand in both defenses with

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
be over a thousand in both defenses with
this<00:01:51.930> setup<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.189> means<00:01:53.399> you're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
this setup and then that means you're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.550 
this setup and then that means you're
just<00:01:53.729> toxic<00:01:53.970> infestation<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.869> opponent<00:01:55.200> they

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just toxic infestation or opponent they

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.780 
just toxic infestation or opponent they
can't<00:01:55.770> switch<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.189> they're<00:01:56.399> also<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
can't switch out they're also going to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.520 
can't switch out they're also going to
get<00:01:56.909> burned<00:01:57.119> down<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.290> aren't

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
get burned down and if they aren't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
get burned down and if they aren't
immune<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.009> toxic<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.549> any<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.390> they

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
immune to toxic in any way then they

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
immune to toxic in any way then they
just<00:02:00.869> lose<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.500> couple<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.770> turns<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.280> rest

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just lose in a couple of turns you rest

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
just lose in a couple of turns you rest
you<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> chest<00:02:03.540> over<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.960> first<00:02:04.170> time

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you get that chest over the first time

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
you get that chest over the first time
and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.579> rest<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and then you can just kind of rest and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
and then you can just kind of rest and
take<00:02:06.270> less<00:02:06.479> damage<00:02:06.509> than<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.680> know

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
take less damage than they are you know

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
take less damage than they are you know
set<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.009> an<00:02:08.190> infestation<00:02:08.610> set<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> toxic

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
set up an infestation set up a toxic

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
set up an infestation set up a toxic
then<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> rest<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> when<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> wake<00:02:11.099> up

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
then you can rest and when you wake up

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.619 
then you can rest and when you wake up
you're<00:02:11.580> most<00:02:11.819> likely<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> more

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you're most likely going to have more

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.950 
you're most likely going to have more
health<00:02:12.810> than<00:02:12.989> they<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.739> from

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
health than they do just from

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.180 
health than they do just from
that<00:02:14.110> burn<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.500> they're<00:02:14.620> taking<00:02:14.920> from<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
that burn that they're taking from the

that burn that they're taking from the
toxic<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.670> infestation<00:02:16.420> now<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.990> nature<00:02:17.350> I

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
toxic and infestation now the nature I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.720 
toxic and infestation now the nature I
was<00:02:17.590> thinking<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.070> was<00:02:18.250> calm<00:02:18.550> nature

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
was thinking on this was calm nature

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.700 
was thinking on this was calm nature
pretty<00:02:19.510> much<00:02:19.660> we're<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:19.990> fully<00:02:20.230> investing

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
pretty much we're just fully investing

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.500 
pretty much we're just fully investing
into<00:02:20.860> one<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.700> putting<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> nature<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
into one and then putting the nature and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.030 
into one and then putting the nature and
the<00:02:22.600> other<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.110> wanted<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the other if you wanted to do it the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.980 
the other if you wanted to do it the
other<00:02:24.160> way<00:02:24.280> around<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:25.510> really<00:02:25.630> have<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
other way around all we really have to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.260 
other way around all we really have to
do<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.320> go<00:02:26.500> look<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:27.280> fashionable<00:02:27.760> bold

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
do is just go look not fashionable bold

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.810 
do is just go look not fashionable bold
nature<00:02:28.480> go<00:02:29.110> bold<00:02:29.320> nature<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.920> then<00:02:30.040> 252<00:02:30.580> and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
nature go bold nature and then 252 and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.700 
nature go bold nature and then 252 and
it's<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.240> same<00:02:31.420> things<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.960> whichever<00:02:32.290> nature

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
it's the same things so whichever nature

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.020 
it's the same things so whichever nature
you<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.100> your<00:02:33.220> hand<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.850> save

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
you can get your hand on you can save

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.340 
you can get your hand on you can save
yourself<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.390> lot<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> work<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.020> also<00:02:35.170> like

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
yourself a lot of work you can also like

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.300 
yourself a lot of work you can also like
reduce<00:02:35.680> speed

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
reduce speed

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.470 
reduce speed
you<00:02:36.460> can<00:02:36.580> even<00:02:36.700> reduce<00:02:37.030> Special<00:02:37.420> Attack

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
you can even reduce Special Attack

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.270 
you can even reduce Special Attack
because<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.140> one<00:02:38.410> extra<00:02:38.530> point<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.950> damage

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
because that one extra point of damage

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.490 
because that one extra point of damage
and<00:02:39.400> infestation<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.840> isn't<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.350> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
and infestation really isn't going to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440 
and infestation really isn't going to
change<00:02:41.530> too<00:02:42.040> much<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.730> chuckles<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.270> very

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
change too much so chuckles are very

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.420 
change too much so chuckles are very
easy<00:02:43.810> Pokemon<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.530> nature's<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.280> you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
easy Pokemon to get nature's or if you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.250 
easy Pokemon to get nature's or if you
don't<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.120> then<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.170> of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
don't have it and then you just kind of

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
switch out because of infestation so

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.020 
switch out because of infestation so
it's<00:04:12.010> going<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.220> take<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> lot<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.580> prediction

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
it's going to take a lot of prediction

that you know if you if they switch into
your<00:04:15.160> infestation<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.970> might<00:04:16.299> be<00:04:16.390> able<00:04:16.510> to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
your infestation you might be able to

want to play the mind games you feel
there's<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.780> more<00:04:20.080> anticipation<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.830> that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
there's a more anticipation of that

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.800 
there's a more anticipation of that
encore<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.670> just<00:04:21.850> go<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:22.390> knock<00:04:22.570> off

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
encore you can just go with knock off

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.710 
encore you can just go with knock off
that<00:04:23.290> knock<00:04:23.530> off<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.980> a<00:04:24.010> very<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:25.150> reliable

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
that knock off is a very just reliable

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.370 
that knock off is a very just reliable
move<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.200> you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
move that you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.080 
move that you
setup<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:26.770> sticky<00:04:27.190> web<00:04:27.370> there<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.760> cord

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
setup your sticky web there on cord

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.790 
setup your sticky web there on cord
there<00:04:28.270> whatever<00:04:28.450> throughout<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.440> knockoff

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
there whatever throughout the knockoff

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.290 
there whatever throughout the knockoff
and<00:04:29.830> then<00:04:30.190> you're<00:04:30.370> still<00:04:30.550> doing<00:04:30.820> damage<00:04:31.000> while

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and then you're still doing damage while

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.420 
and then you're still doing damage while
also<00:04:31.450> being<00:04:31.660> absurdly<00:04:31.990> tanky<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.650> recommend

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
also being absurdly tanky I recommend

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.130 
also being absurdly tanky I recommend
pretty<00:04:33.670> much<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.940> same<00:04:34.090> set<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.390> if<00:04:34.810> you're

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
pretty much the same set that if you're

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.630 
pretty much the same set that if you're
split<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> defense's<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.580> a

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
split on the defense's and you have a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.890 
split on the defense's and you have a
hit<00:04:36.790> point<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.390> getting<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.720> most

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
hit point you're getting the most

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.420 
hit point you're getting the most
effective<00:04:38.260> health<00:04:38.410> possible<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.070> you're

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
effective health possible and you're

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250 
effective health possible and you're
pretty<00:04:39.550> much<00:04:39.670> ready<00:04:40.060> for<00:04:40.210> anything<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.170> then

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
pretty much ready for anything and then

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.680 
pretty much ready for anything and then
we<00:04:41.890> have<00:04:42.040> doubles<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.700> for<00:04:42.970> doubles<00:04:43.300> there's<00:04:43.600> a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we have doubles so for doubles there's a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.450 
we have doubles so for doubles there's a
pretty<00:04:43.990> cool<00:04:44.170> gimmick<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.770> like<00:04:45.160> bringing

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
pretty cool gimmick that I like bringing

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.250 
pretty cool gimmick that I like bringing
out<00:04:45.700> that's<00:04:45.940> really<00:04:46.090> strong<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.080> have

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
out that's really strong that you have

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.530 
out that's really strong that you have
Moody<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:47.860> acupressure<00:04:48.460> acupressure<00:04:49.420> is

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
Moody and acupressure acupressure is

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540 
Moody and acupressure acupressure is
going<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.870> raise<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.050> random<00:04:50.380> staff<00:04:50.620> by<00:04:50.890> 2<00:04:50.950> and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
going to raise a random staff by 2 and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.950 
going to raise a random staff by 2 and
then<00:04:51.730> moody<00:04:52.030> does<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.330> same<00:04:52.540> thing<00:04:52.780> at<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
then moody does the same thing at the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.570 
then moody does the same thing at the
end<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.290> turn<00:04:53.440> since<00:04:53.890> it<00:04:54.010> also<00:04:54.160> lowers<00:04:54.430> a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
end of the turn since it also lowers a

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.180 
end of the turn since it also lowers a
stat<00:04:54.820> by<00:04:55.000> 1<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.750> looking<00:04:56.080> at<00:04:56.200> gain<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.530> plus<00:04:56.830> 4

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
stat by 1 so looking at gain of plus 4

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.520 
stat by 1 so looking at gain of plus 4
and<00:04:57.580> then<00:04:58.000> minus<00:04:58.150> 1<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:58.660> like<00:04:58.750> plus<00:04:58.990> 3<00:04:59.170> stats

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
and then minus 1 so like plus 3 stats

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.660 
and then minus 1 so like plus 3 stats
and<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.830> could<00:04:59.950> be<00:05:00.040> all<00:05:00.070> over<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.400> place<00:05:00.550> you

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
and it could be all over the place you

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.700 
and it could be all over the place you
can<00:05:00.790> get<00:05:00.910> evasion<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.810> can<00:05:02.020> get<00:05:02.110> defensive<00:05:02.350> if

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
can get evasion you can get defensive if

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.110 
can get evasion you can get defensive if
you<00:05:03.040> get<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.280> on<00:05:03.340> chuckle<00:05:03.730> that's<00:05:03.880> going<00:05:04.060> to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
you get that on chuckle that's going to

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.060 
you get that on chuckle that's going to
be<00:05:04.210> very<00:05:04.420> powerful<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.500> idea<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:05.920> you

be very powerful so the idea here is you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.380 
be very powerful so the idea here is you
know<00:05:06.190> smeargle<00:05:06.610> first<00:05:06.940> turn<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.180> going<00:05:07.330> to

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
know smeargle first turn is going to

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.270 
know smeargle first turn is going to
entrain<00:05:07.690> moody<00:05:08.020> on<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.260> chuckle<00:05:08.590> chuckle<00:05:09.160> can

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
entrain moody on the chuckle chuckle can

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.850 
entrain moody on the chuckle chuckle can
also<00:05:09.460> acupressure<00:05:10.240> itself<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.290> then<00:05:11.590> smear

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
also acupressure itself and then smear

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.380 
also acupressure itself and then smear
golden<00:05:12.130> acupressure<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.090> now<00:05:13.180> we're<00:05:13.330> looking

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
golden acupressure so now we're looking

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.720 
golden acupressure so now we're looking
at<00:05:13.630> gain<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:13.990> +5<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.830> end<00:05:14.980> after<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.460> minus

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
at gain of +5 in the end after the minus

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.610 
at gain of +5 in the end after the minus
1<00:05:15.940> drop<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.420> if<00:05:16.750> all<00:05:16.930> those<00:05:17.110> are<00:05:17.320> going<00:05:17.410> in

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
1 drop and if all those are going in

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.290

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600 
could get messed up by that you could
lose<00:05:22.810> defense<00:05:23.620> from<00:05:23.800> your<00:05:24.010> Moody<00:05:24.250> in<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.490> end

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
lose defense from your Moody in the end

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.100 
lose defense from your Moody in the end
then<00:05:25.180> you're<00:05:25.300> still<00:05:25.480> dealing<00:05:25.630> with<00:05:25.780> rest

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
then you're still dealing with rest

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.260 
then you're still dealing with rest
toxic<00:05:26.590> infestation<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.760> like<00:05:27.940> throwing<00:05:28.180> on

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
toxic infestation and I like throwing on

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.490 
toxic infestation and I like throwing on
the<00:05:28.300> bright<00:05:28.540> powder<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.170> just<00:05:29.290> adds

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
the bright powder because it just adds

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.960 
the bright powder because it just adds
to<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.980> randomness<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.670> makes<00:05:30.790> it<00:05:30.910> a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
to the randomness and it makes it a

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.520 
to the randomness and it makes it a
little<00:05:31.090> more<00:05:31.240> fun<00:05:31.510> that<00:05:32.020> accuracy<00:05:32.470> has

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
little more fun that accuracy has

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.800 
little more fun that accuracy has

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
already turned to 0.9 times you get some

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.390 
already turned to 0.9 times you get some
invasion<00:05:35.230> on<00:05:35.320> top<00:05:35.500> of<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:35.680> your<00:05:36.100> opponent's

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
invasion on top of that your opponent's

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.590 
invasion on top of that your opponent's
gonna<00:05:36.490> have<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.640> very<00:05:36.850> hard<00:05:37.030> time<00:05:37.150> hitting<00:05:37.330> you

gonna have a very hard time hitting you

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.360 
gonna have a very hard time hitting you

or just burning them down with toxic

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.640 
or just burning them down with toxic
infestation<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.240> it's<00:05:41.170> just<00:05:41.380> something

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
not gonna be like hey I just averaged

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.020 
not gonna be like hey I just averaged
out<00:07:11.110> with<00:07:11.230> a<00:07:11.260> Garchomp<00:07:11.770> now<00:07:11.920> I'm<00:07:12.010> at<00:07:12.160> like<00:07:12.340> 90

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
out with a Garchomp now I'm at like 90

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.150 
out with a Garchomp now I'm at like 90
base<00:07:13.300> attack<00:07:13.660> or<00:07:13.870> something<00:07:14.260> I<00:07:14.470> think<00:07:15.040> it'd<00:07:15.130> be

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
base attack or something I think it'd be

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.800 
base attack or something I think it'd be
a<00:07:15.250> little<00:07:15.460> higher<00:07:15.580> than<00:07:15.610> that<00:07:15.940> but<00:07:16.150> still<00:07:16.330> it's

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
a little higher than that but still it's

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.840 
a little higher than that but still it's
not<00:07:16.930> ridiculous<00:07:17.800> kind<00:07:18.220> of<00:07:18.310> stats<00:07:18.550> that<00:07:18.730> you're

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
not ridiculous kind of stats that you're

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.060 
not ridiculous kind of stats that you're
gaining<00:07:19.000> from<00:07:19.240> it<00:07:19.390> and<00:07:19.570> they<00:07:20.050> can<00:07:20.200> be<00:07:20.350> phased

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
gaining from it and they can be phased

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
gaining from it and they can be phased
out<00:07:21.250> by<00:07:21.430> your<00:07:21.550> opponent<00:07:21.790> that<00:07:21.850> your<00:07:21.970> phone

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
out by your opponent that your phone

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.940 
out by your opponent that your phone
just<00:07:22.270> switches<00:07:22.660> and<00:07:22.780> it's<00:07:22.930> done<00:07:23.110> and<00:07:23.380> then

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:23.950 
just switches and it's done and then

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.710 
just switches and it's done and then
guard<00:07:24.280> split<00:07:24.580> now<00:07:24.700> guard<00:07:24.940> split<00:07:25.240> is<00:07:25.360> the<00:07:25.540> one

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
guard split now guard split is the one

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.720 
guard split now guard split is the one
that<00:07:25.870> I<00:07:25.930> feel<00:07:26.080> can<00:07:26.290> work<00:07:26.500> in<00:07:26.650> doubles<00:07:27.010> averages

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
that I feel can work in doubles averages

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.920 
that I feel can work in doubles averages
defense<00:07:28.060> and<00:07:28.240> special<00:07:28.390> offense

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
defense and special offense

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.830 
defense and special offense
Blissey<00:07:29.970> Chauncey<00:07:30.970> I<00:07:31.000> would<00:07:31.390> say<00:07:31.510> Chauncey

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 
Blissey Chauncey I would say Chauncey

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.510 
Blissey Chauncey I would say Chauncey
more<00:07:32.020> because<00:07:32.230> that<00:07:32.260> feo<00:07:32.650> light<00:07:32.860> is<00:07:33.040> super

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 
more because that feo light is super

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.980 
more because that feo light is super
strong<00:07:33.790> so<00:07:34.330> now<00:07:34.420> you're<00:07:34.600> going<00:07:34.750> to<00:07:34.840> give

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
strong so now you're going to give

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.860 
strong so now you're going to give
Chauncey<00:07:35.740> more<00:07:36.010> defense<00:07:36.340> more<00:07:37.300> special

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
Chauncey more defense more special

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.630 
Chauncey more defense more special
offense<00:07:38.170> and<00:07:38.470> then<00:07:38.950> it's<00:07:39.130> going<00:07:39.280> to<00:07:39.370> be<00:07:39.520> under

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640 
offense and then it's going to be under

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.940 
offense and then it's going to be under
that<00:07:39.880> huge<00:07:40.450> amount<00:07:40.780> of<00:07:40.870> hit<00:07:41.020> points<00:07:41.050> that's

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950 
that huge amount of hit points that's

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.860 
that huge amount of hit points that's
where<00:07:42.280> it<00:07:42.370> kind<00:07:42.460> of<00:07:42.580> come<00:07:42.700> in<00:07:42.850> comes<00:07:43.360> in<00:07:43.510> Alison

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
where it kind of come in comes in Alison

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.660 
where it kind of come in comes in Alison
Chad<00:07:44.230> isn't<00:07:44.650> just<00:07:44.830> like<00:07:44.980> Chauncey<00:07:45.340> implicitly

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.670 
Chad isn't just like Chauncey implicitly

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.980 
Chad isn't just like Chauncey implicitly
that<00:07:45.820> guard<00:07:46.000> split<00:07:46.240> works<00:07:46.420> really<00:07:46.570> well<00:07:46.780> with

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990 
that guard split works really well with

that guard split works really well with
its<00:07:47.290> a<00:07:47.620> lot<00:07:47.770> of<00:07:47.800> other<00:07:47.980> Pokemon<00:07:48.460> that<00:07:48.640> like

its a lot of other Pokemon that like

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.280 
its a lot of other Pokemon that like

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.290 
need that little extra defense boost I

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.510 
need that little extra defense boost I
already<00:07:50.470> have<00:07:50.560> a<00:07:50.590> lot<00:07:50.830> of<00:07:50.860> hit<00:07:51.070> point<00:07:51.310> bulk

like<00:07:51.970> Quagsire<00:07:52.510> clogs<00:07:53.230> are<00:07:53.380> he<00:07:53.590> won't<00:07:53.680> care

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.010 
like Quagsire clogs are he won't care

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.620 
like Quagsire clogs are he won't care
he'll<00:07:54.640> get<00:07:54.760> that<00:07:54.880> guard<00:07:55.150> split<00:07:55.420> and<00:07:55.570> then

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.630 
he'll get that guard split and then

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.360 
he'll get that guard split and then
he'll<00:07:55.810> be<00:07:55.930> unaware<00:07:56.140> and<00:07:56.500> then<00:07:56.770> it<00:07:56.920> gets<00:07:57.100> really

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.370 
he'll be unaware and then it gets really

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.970 
he'll be unaware and then it gets really
good<00:07:57.550> from<00:07:57.760> there<00:07:57.940> but<00:07:58.510> the<00:07:58.840> powers<00:07:59.230> trick<00:07:59.770> and

00:07:59.970 --> 00:07:59.980 
good from there but the powers trick and

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.740 
good from there but the powers trick and
cow<00:08:00.130> just<00:08:00.460> don't<00:08:00.700> do<00:08:00.790> the<00:08:00.880> power<00:08:01.090> things<00:08:01.330> those

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:01.750 
cow just don't do the power things those

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.810 
cow just don't do the power things those
are<00:08:01.990> those<00:08:02.620> are<00:08:02.680> really<00:08:03.070> messy<00:08:03.370> to<00:08:03.490> boar<00:08:03.640> cliff

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:03.820 
are those are really messy to boar cliff

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.070
