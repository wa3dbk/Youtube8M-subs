00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.600
 hi friends today in review watches 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.960
 Cassio, what model do we see? 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.880
 called w212 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.420
 let's take a closer look 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.750
 mass media side point 38 millimeters 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 in diameter 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.019
 thickness is 10 millimeters like this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 Here is the thickness of 10 millimeters glass 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.880
 slightly convex it is protected by two 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.950
 here are the flurries of plastic 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.420
 nodules 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:48.149
 that protect the glass 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:52.370
 the part is completely metal now i'm 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.870
 a little more detail I'll show it all 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.870
 turned the napkin from under the invicta 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 Here we removed the most natural metal 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.729
 You can see this is a watch without a casing. Why is it? 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.729
 did well it was just interesting 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:02.799
 see what's inside 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:06.380
 we put back just happens sometimes 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.739
 wonder when they talk about what 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.549
 Did this manufacturers make a case ? 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.859
 mobile phone price there 600 800 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.630
 dollars from metal and often not even 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.650
 from metal is there anything back cover 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.819
 it serves as a special achievement here 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.870
 made a metal case 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.730
 and here's the usual clock in general 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.579
 inexpensive and here it is enough 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.430
 complex metal part and nobody 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.430
 does not give it as over reaching 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.260
 so disassembly-assembly ended 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.160
 back to the clock they are collected means 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.810
 model with metal bezel that is 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.270
 plastic top closed again 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.300
 metal casing beads these like 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.750
 please glass unfortunately acrylic 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.220
 stainless steel back cover on 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.880
 back cover information in general 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:32.140
 a little type of module the model number is written 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.750
 what's a stainless steel back cover and 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.740
 water resistance 5 bar 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.830
 polyurethane strap plastic 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.900
 the clip here is this plastic this part 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.460
 also plastic but the watch is very light 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.530
 so I do not think that there will be 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.560
 any problems then there is no load 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.230
 there should be a big clock function now 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.680
 have the mode the first main display is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.410
 the clock itself displays the hour of the minute 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.340
 seconds day of the week 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.980
 the number is the month and the date and on 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.630
 alarm status indicator all that 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.950
 refers to the alarm clock consider a little 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.950
 closer means 5 alarm clocks 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:20.780
 Look 45 times two three 4 5 modes 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.490
 The alarm clock is quite interesting that is 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.030
 we can set the time will not 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.970
 show we can set 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.260
 or on a specific date here if we 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.640
 set the month it means per hour at 1 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.440
 month will start every day 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.190
 alarm clock I do not know why it is needed but 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.450
 this function is the second mode we can 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.210
 set the month and day and accordingly 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.330
 that day will call Well Service 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.900
 as a reminder probably still mom 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.900
 set the mode 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:04.640
 when we have a space instead of a month 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.710
 every month every month like this a 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.780
 option 4 numbers will call and 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.430
 Well, I also do not know why it is necessary, well, or 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.180
 just if we leave these parts all 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.240
 empty 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:20.980
 both top alarm will ring every 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:24.400
 day that is if we insert 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.350
 empty here next alarm activation 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.820
 happens by pressing that is now we 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.860
 put this activation button here 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.960
 alarm clock occurs by pressing this 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.260
 buttons here look the fifth alarm clock 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:44.510
 further activated the mode and here 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:49.610
 now let's go let's say alarm 2 then 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.590
 the same thing is the second demolition mode that is 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.660
 doze mode when the alarm is still 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.280
 after after the call in five minutes 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.720
 reenabled and so on here 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.490
 further timer timer in general 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.600
 fairly standard unity we 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.390
 we can turn on the timer 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.660
 just at the end of a signal 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:12.460
 elite between replay this when in mode 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.340
 the timer we even have this button here 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:20.180
 authors pit that is, please note 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.670
 The authors pit this repetition ie by 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.850
 at the end of the timer it starts up again 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.080
 but on reaching 0 5 1 delivers sound 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.080
 clock signal 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.430
 i.e. stopwatch stopwatch with 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.710
 intermediate result 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.820
 that is , the stopwatch stopped while doing so 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.320
 keeps going 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:42.650
 watched the time slowly recorded 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:47.120
 pursed stopwatch goes stop stop and 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.950
 reset and second time zone that is 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.690
 second time zone we can set 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.440
 this one we need accordingly 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.210
 as if by changing time zones we 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.310
 just switch to 2 time or 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.080
 just see what time we need 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.340
 well, that's probably all 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.860
 the only thing you can say 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.430
 Now I will show you how the backlight looks like. 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.900
 how does the watch look on the hand 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.150
 here so watch look on his arm chu hours 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.820
 lighter something about 40 grams but it 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.280
 it is not surprising that the clock is not medium-sized 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.460
 heavy left to show only 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.039
 the backlight is sitting comfortably 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.060
 practically not heard now show by 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:31.009
 target highlighting looks like this 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:33.800
 backlight LED backlight bright in 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.470
 Generally the only thing that can be 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.370
 some have become accustomed to 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.530
 electroluminescent backlight which 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.229
 more evenly illuminates the screen here 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.320
 just LED everything is such a review 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.460
 It turned out thanks for your attention 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.460
 subscribe to the channel all bye
