00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.469
 so finally we waited for the first 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:13.389
 harvest of cucumbers in a barrel today with us 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:18.470
 May twenty-eighth as we see 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:22.480
 the first cucumbers we have not ripened now 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:28.690
 you need to collect them to give growth to others 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:32.029
 cucumbers how to grow cucumbers in a barrel 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.430
 I have already told the whole galaxy that is 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.520
 first you must of course necessarily 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.570
 to grow good seedlings later 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.690
 to lay the barrel in my case correctly 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.320
 it's just a box or barrel 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.820
 the right ground that is to the bottom you need 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.700
 how to put on music 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.780
 bioreactor to keep the fruit warm and up 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.110
 fall asleep a good fertile ground here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.189
 you need cucumbers you will see to build something 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.100
 the type of shelter that can be 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:13.969
 harbor I still harbor film 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.939
 Here I have it for the night and just 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:21.459
 I tie this construction with a string 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.459
 also very easy to do with a barrel 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:30.349
 in this way you get it earlier 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:33.380
 cucumbers and what is the advantage in 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:36.249
 the fact that they can grow here almost everything 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.090
 years that is, we finally shoot the film and 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:45.229
 cucumbers will continue to branch out and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.450
 around this improvised barrel they 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.599
 how would be vice and grow natural 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.560
 we will collect them there is a way 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.979
 to grow previously herds without greenhouses 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.880
 because it is not a prince and generally very 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.479
 difficult to grow previously different topics 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.440
 less here is month month and i have 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.540
 cucumbers are just covered here i'm simple 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.400
 film on the bed to achieve this 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.019
 impossible on a bed of cucumbers 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.870
 as soon as the seed has risen, as it were 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.989
 gave 1 1 only the leaves will not be yet 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.030
 earlier than a month and these cucumbers we 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.880
 we will eat now 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:52.160
 tear off the shoe and heel cooked 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:03:04.970
 especially here such here and here 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:11.810
 Wonderful cucumbers 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.380
 see beautifully the first 4 cucumbers and very 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 lot 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.579
 embryos that are now tasty already 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.489
 more or less 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.040
 divorced and now they will give 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.530
 constantly harvest is now on the street true 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.329
 it is very cold therefore herds can 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.780
 barely even stopped their growth 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.359
 but now it will be warm again 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.650
 naturally they 'll take mine again 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:38.709
 the only thing in this barrel is necessary 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.760
 Of course water cucumbers like much 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.170
 more often and rather that much water 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.150
 flows here if you grow 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.989
 the barrels below must be 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.540
 holes and near the bottom sideways too 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.750
 preferably a hole there usually 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.850
 supply oxygen to manure which 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.549
 is downstairs it is constantly burning 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.709
 constantly 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.310
 there was a sort of bioreactor property 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.180
 unity and water just not she care 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.540
 If you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.480
 the teana's linen will still drain you down 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.209
 and a barrel if you will be made barrels I 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.759
 In this case, the thing I raised a little 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.910
 above the ground that is below me like 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:28.850
 there is an air gap where too 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:31.820
 all wisdom comes out and so 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.800
 say growing cucumbers in barrels 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:41.270
 let's find stop release now 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:47.380
 my cucumbers further develop here or 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.380
 pleases me and my family a good harvest 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.130
 the only thing you want a little more 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.220
 say what is of course required 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.889
 small formation at the first moment 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.710
 we look if on the main stem with us 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.710
 formed bursa as it is now better 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.169
 first first side shoots as it 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.479
 a little pinch here 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.910
 give 2-3 leaves and then them 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.840
 pinch keep out no further 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.990
 grow 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.229
 and already when the bush is more formed then 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.110
 we will give further to him 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.110
 grow and since fertile 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.810
 land and we have here in this barrel a lot 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.090
 it is enough for us to grow 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.460
 here it is planted 2 like a fighter to 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.729
 they can rza have grown and given 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.530
 high-grade good times but bye 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.990
 meeting 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.990
 so the first bursaries are received in May
