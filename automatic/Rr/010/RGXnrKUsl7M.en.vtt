00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:01.420
 Dr 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.420
 mr 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 the hall 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.740
 because we were for many the guilty guest of the volunteer fire department 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 became big at Hannover 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880
 13 different motives on only two days to get the cash 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.080
 All our models were real firefighters 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.080
 photo-shoot made but Hey they have done well 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 It is our first hatch village 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.480
 Early in the morning was a mix of compact benefits 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 and the portable flash Quadra by Telecom in front of a black studio 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.650
 background 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.270
 For this we used the large garage of a fire truck and had to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 first set up the mobile background system 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 After that, the experts of the TDS and Frederik B have delivered one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.440
 it's producing light on the sides 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 To make it even crisper, I have the bits suitcase to 100 and 5 millimeters 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:02.580
 declined 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.860
 Remote controlled EBA FSE then with a waterbed on my camera 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.310
 Aalen 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.620
 if 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.270
 with a few simple clicks in - then I have enough places in 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.190
 Groups split the group also for the lower ones for the ears pulled 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.460
 while 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.920
 just a few final corrections to the orientation of the seats 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 and just under 15 minutes we were ready for our first night 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.440
 Immediately on my first test photo you can see very nicely the clinic us 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.350
 communicate with each other in milliseconds via small flashes as with 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 one ear so well 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 with light 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 and here is our first result 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.479
 those were quite nice pictures but my feeling was the face 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.799
 another one to four too dark so we have the load as light as that 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.799
 Boxing a PSP 800 in group c put from the front 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.699
 much better or something was still missing embarrassing from behind so I bet 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.939
 my assistant Philipp with a manually set is in 900 behind 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.259
 our model on the ground 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.439
 b 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.989
 b 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.519
 Group ob Alexa is set at 900 euros one to strong 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.549
 when now the yellow reflective strips produced on the back 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.649
 a yellow worse on the black background 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.509
 but nothing to worry about just because 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.769
 900 a bit down rules and then looked quite nice 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.640
 and also a few photos Roth we to a second front man to do so 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.739
 at four-page seats were still set up for our first modern 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.629
 when will find only 900 with a so-called Slutwalks set so 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.469
 by the way, punctual light on our second model of the flight exists 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.649
 Foam rubber for just under a euro per piece in the craft shop to get 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 and so our light now sits down together 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.699
 Has financial test 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.249
 just 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.980
 to show the strong community 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.980
 Button mingled with a third case, the man to do so 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.549
 but the light for two but of course not automatically correct for three 

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.469
 adjusted so we once again arrange the seats and align 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.419
 had 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.240
 I want to notice pretty fast 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.020
 that a smaller fires in the range around 16 would have to be set at all 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.840
 to focus from front to back 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.910
 in which the 800 Millisievert but lack the strength I have, however 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.910
 exchanged a square of the KOF 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.500
 if yes save a contract effective situation with the easy box I wanted to do it 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.240
 I needed two extras the silver adapter from Last Light Bodner dapd 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 for the affected to be able to record the silicone bienert 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.559
 In order to incorporate the simplification setup agreement I have him over the 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.620
 integrated photo cell activated 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.620
 so he has thrown together with in the complex 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.439
 4 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.439
 not at the back 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.939
 from 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.590
 there 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.930
 for the last photo this last one 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.309
 Then we set up the firefighters like the corner of a triangle 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:58.299
 the two episode man behind the bottom one is the 800 with Snoop punctually 

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:01.659
 illuminated and the camera front center illuminated this box from diagonally above 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.360
 okay thanks for watching after a quick review of the photos 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.710
 since then than me 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.710
 which will be everywhere 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.249
 was 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:10.349
 long 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:12.259
 mr 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.819
 on
