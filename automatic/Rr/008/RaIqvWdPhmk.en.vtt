Manny Pacquiao was Timothy Bradley too
and<00:00:22.169> yeah<00:00:23.169> I<00:00:23.199> thought<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.560> episode<00:00:24.009> was<00:00:24.640> an

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
and yeah I thought the episode was an

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.179 
and yeah I thought the episode was an
okay<00:00:25.480> episode<00:00:25.929> it's<00:00:26.169> not<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.470> best<00:00:26.619> episode

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
okay episode it's not the best episode

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.829 
okay episode it's not the best episode
but<00:00:27.220> at<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.699> same<00:00:27.909> time<00:00:28.150> it's<00:00:28.390> not<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.659> worst

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
but at the same time it's not the worst

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.400 
but at the same time it's not the worst

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
didn't hear it clearly i think was like

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.790 
didn't hear it clearly i think was like
in<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.510> different<00:00:52.900> building<00:00:53.320> or<00:00:53.470> something

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
in the different building or something

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.590 
in the different building or something
like<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:53.920> i<00:00:54.190> don't<00:00:54.670> know<00:00:54.760> but<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.150> dislike

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
like that i don't know but the dislike

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.300 
like that i don't know but the dislike
that<00:00:55.810> that's<00:00:56.230> like<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.560> div<00:00:56.740> he's<00:00:56.890> stringing<00:00:57.160> a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
that that's like a div he's stringing a

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.310 
that that's like a div he's stringing a
different<00:00:57.670> gym<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.090> then<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.750> main<00:00:58.930> gym<00:00:59.140> is

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
different gym and then the main gym is

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.600 
different gym and then the main gym is
somewhere<00:00:59.590> else<00:00:59.740> but<00:01:00.070> i<00:01:00.100> think<00:01:00.340> it's<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.490> the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
somewhere else but i think it's in the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.310 
somewhere else but i think it's in the
same<00:01:00.850> area<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.270> was<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.570> same<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.110> same

like it's different compared to the main

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.380 
like it's different compared to the main
main<00:01:19.150> dream<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.720> wild<00:01:20.080> card<00:01:20.350> gym<00:01:20.440> and
