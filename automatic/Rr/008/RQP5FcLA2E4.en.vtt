00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good to all I am family science and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.580
 I bring you a new video of this robot 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.950
 your first division and well there you can 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 the team that touched me is nothing 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.680
 another world but good you have to have 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 always be careful because you already know how it is 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.700
 this as is the fifa goal especially 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 fear chamak calls that he is a player that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.860
 it has not really exploded it did not arrive 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.930
 explode had a couple of good years and 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.460
 such but nothing more but in the game that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.410
 it happens that he is tall he is a tall player 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 that and also head that will get you 50 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.100
 goals of head and you that you spoke because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 he is a player that really does not do 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.520
 a rainbow goal but good is what 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.739
 there is in this game no and good to see if 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 I can continue with the streak I have 800 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.829
 I'm not wrong, I do not have it very 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 I'm not very 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.370
 results that I carry for now but yes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 that I have three safe points of one in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 a single match in this division and if 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 Earn those six dots then I'll get 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.770
 pretty well I think there are ten to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.540
 ascend 13 for the title so to see 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.920
 how come come come on let's go first 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.230
 occasionally to see if we already do well 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 even the tops of mind already 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 I say in all the videos are finished 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
 all but all all all all all 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 Let's see if we forgive fernandinho whore 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 pretty that I had done as hudson like 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.970
 how well you have seen it, you have not seen 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 to his defense completely stopped not 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 I understand why I do not understand 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.259
 it's true that I seem to get angry 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.580
 when I put goals but it's not that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
 what I do not like is that it happens to me later 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
 to me that precisely it is good to continue 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 defending like I'm defending very 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 well without losing stupid balls by 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 what the fuck do I have to talk about? 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 the same thing always happens to me every time 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 Once you raise the bread in the damn 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 game this to see they go they go from a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 Hold it hold up hold it gave me last 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.440
 the pint looks really bad 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.970
 less bad less bad that is not sued 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.740
 because we go on the very clear occasion that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.740
 I have saved myself but miraculously 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.480
 let's see I'm losing control of 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.520
 party and this I do not like anything good and 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.130
 good mega recovery 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.799
 how good that happens let's see they 're going 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.689
 to see are that good blow well let's go 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.060
 let's go to the end I thought that the failed 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.469
 when he threw himself to the ground there I say to that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 I short after the play I 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.539
 done looking here precisely no less 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 bad that threw place and removed strong 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.519
 to the center because we go if you do not take it out 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.519
 safe 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.680
 to see what good recovery we are going other 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:21.830
 to the work that goes on let's go let's go to 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.780
 see are innkeepers who have done 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.950
 has created sales with or has it seemed to me 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 I do not know what I've done I do not know what buttons 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.030
 It has tightened but it seemed to me that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 He pulled heel looked but he will be bastard 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.080
 go cloth 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.560
 to 20 I will not lose the match now 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.880
 I can lose the game is coming to me 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 much now and I'm not liking anything 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.290
 I'm doing fatal 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.019
 well let's fernandinho 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.990
 it is because it passes more bad without advantage 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.000
 no male 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.910
 I have fought and fought a brake 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.580

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.710

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.160

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.530
 award for where after incredible 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.200
 the goalkeeper 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.500
 I go this is always a goal of 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.600
 head now yes let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.330

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.100
 impossible nothing game is going to hook me 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.760
 they are going to throw me against the insurance there 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 it's too bad that it's going on, no, it's not 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.989
 you open the door , you open, you go 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.910
 mine that bundled the one that has arrived 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.960
 I thought I was going to pass it and I say that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.960
 fatal but fatal 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.260
 my mother low 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.319
 because nothing in the game I have got into 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.849
 the match with a stupid goal 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.519
 he had the game at the best moment 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.170
 because he was controlling now there was 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.170
 I had a bad time since it dominated me 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.540
 a little the look of there then nothing in the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.760
 match again and wait, wait 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.760
 be half silly you will see that 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.310
 grace me normal that the ally the mother 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.420
 mine but to clear that that clear that 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.700
 I took off silk I do not believe it, I did not 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.260
 I think because I just got those two 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.450
 consecutive clearances I think he tells me 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.209
 of the tasks and see it lost that was the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 King of that because it is ashamed 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.349
 in this shit that I just made mother 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.049
 mine that I just arrived because nothing in 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:22.489
 the party like that is 22 in 61 by me 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.489
 by two to the enemies the truth 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.650
 that you can still win man 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.080
 let's see are for what luck what 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.700
 luck what luck we are going to investor 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.350
 let's go pretty 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.870
 come on let's go let's perfect man 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.400
 perfect could have followed with nelson 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.810
 but I thought they were going to catch me 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.250
 body as in this body game is 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.720
 so important 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.100
 the centrals tend to have a lot more 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.260
 that's why I opened and searched the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.050
 center has worked out well for me that's good 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.370
 miracle miracle of having given another 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.590
 blow of head by the way of I carry two 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.830
 in this game well fine alright we're going 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830
 we go 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.479
 Wait, they 're going to make me sake the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.990
 truth that I have done more times already ss 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.850
 ss I do not believe it hey seriously seriously 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.250
 my mother of cristian where she thinks of 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.370
 I do not believe this game 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.020
 it's amazing you have seen it, this is not 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.460
 What's in this game anyway 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.990
 I have made a mistake I am going to say it 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.630
 if you spend if you ever do is 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.310
 that serve move the most important thing is 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.370
 that with a player endurance and then with 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.540
 the r1 do two against one important to 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.550
 it has happened to me many times that 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.040
 they make stupid goals and I realized 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.480
 that I have done wrong but good in that 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.370
 moment while you play you are not 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.770
 thinking and good head debate 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.700
 days and nothing is what there is from there to two 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.100
 if you serve any d 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.410
 I know of help for again you know 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.480
 enduring and with the other ere one for 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.650
 do the two against one 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.590
 I'm already getting enough in this young man 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.350
 although good fernandinho let's go there 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.540
 what a shame in a corner this is the good what 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.290
 I'm coming pussy 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.570
 a nice siqueira as pretty as 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.270
 as obvious that not for a ring that 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.190
 good let's go you get a lot of goals like that 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.970
 this year in loose ball in the front 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.950
 no defender there covering in fixos 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.570
 nobody completely only my player does not 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.770
 I know why it is another failure that I 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.260
 found in this game and they are not 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.270
 so obvious but they bother the 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.640
 true 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.540
 come you have to sentence and you have to 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.090
 sentence that we are in a moment 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.440
 dangerous good pass 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.510
 Come on, Anderson, how good was it? 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.430
 goal all in defense 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.910
 the goalkeeper took the defense 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.320
 what a shame while and that was another good 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.290
 put what good is good is good 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.570
 well what good head actress have not 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.100
 been from the same player but three voices 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.480
 He led in this game and of my 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.940
 platonic love in this game that is bang 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.409
 bang the song go piece of beast 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.869
 true signing in by signing if you can 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.330
 once they come to 53 these 90 minute departures 

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:03.209
 come on let's make me productive that happens 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.819
 what happens that I do dance go 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.050
 I played the truth a lot of people say that 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.089
 it's kindergarten to give the death pass 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.550
 but is that the goalie goes out what are you going to 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:13.619
 make play cloth because if you fail the 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.239
 I really think a thing is precious 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:17.129
 it is typical to order the goalkeeper 

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.809
 that there is an uncle three meters behind and 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.990
 still, I'll pass it but this is what I 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:24.060
 it seems perfect let's go the truth 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.220
 Well, this has finished very well 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.170
 very good match I liked a lot 6-3 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.120
 I've had some defensive failures that 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.460
 I should not have had but good I still 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.900
 advancing 6 dots in this division and 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.550
 nothing sometimes I get the title to see if
