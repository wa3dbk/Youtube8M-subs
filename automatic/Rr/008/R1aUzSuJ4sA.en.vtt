experience<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> great<00:01:28.650> moment

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
experience I think it was a great moment

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.149 
experience I think it was a great moment
for<00:01:29.640> us<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.000> discuss<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.720> people<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
for us to discuss how people are not

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
for us to discuss how people are not
what<00:01:32.400> they<00:01:32.430> seem<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.780> think

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
what they seem you know I don't think

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
what they seem you know I don't think
it's<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> media<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.009> create<00:01:35.400> civilian

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's just the media that create civilian

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
it's just the media that create civilian
I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.119> people<00:01:36.299> also<00:01:36.659> make<00:01:36.990> their<00:01:37.200> own

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I think people also make their own

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.469 
I think people also make their own
judgments<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.340> happens<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> moment<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
judgments it happens for the moment it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.870 
judgments it happens for the moment it
was<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.380> spontaneous<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> gets

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
was as you know spontaneous as it gets

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.050 
was as you know spontaneous as it gets
for<00:01:42.000> TV<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.340> personally

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
for TV and I think it was personally
