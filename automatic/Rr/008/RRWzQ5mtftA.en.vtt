how<00:00:13.830> should<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.099> person<00:00:14.490> approach<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.570> task

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
how should a person approach this task

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.660 
how should a person approach this task
well<00:00:16.800> thank<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> very<00:00:17.250> much<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
well thank you very much for the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.099 
well thank you very much for the
question<00:00:18.150> Craig<00:00:19.430> sag<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.880> always<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.900> an

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
question Craig sag as always is an

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.189 
question Craig sag as always is an
arbitrary<00:00:22.830> measurement<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.720> people<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
arbitrary measurement some people like a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.640 
arbitrary measurement some people like a
very<00:00:25.500> plush<00:00:25.830> bike<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.789> easy<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.269> ride<00:00:27.449> around

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
very plush bike it's easy to ride around

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
very plush bike it's easy to ride around
because<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.769> commute<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> some

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
because they commute a lot on it some

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
because they commute a lot on it some
sport<00:00:30.689> tools<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.529> need<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> little

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
sport tools so they need a little

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
sport tools so they need a little
feedback<00:00:32.329> some<00:00:33.329> obviously<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:34.020> quite

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
feedback some obviously are quite

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
feedback some obviously are quite
aggressive<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.340> ride<00:00:35.520> their

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
aggressive in the way they ride their

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 
aggressive in the way they ride their
motorcycles<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.690> require<00:00:37.649> quite<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> taut

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
motorcycles and require quite a taut

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.369 
motorcycles and require quite a taut
chassis<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> level<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
chassis because of the level of use and

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
chassis because of the level of use and
performance<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.710> require<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.670> their

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
performance that they require of their

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
performance that they require of their
motorcycle<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.800> regards<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> your

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
motorcycle so in regards to your

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.060 
motorcycle so in regards to your
question<00:00:47.719> if<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.020> lower<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> front<00:00:49.770> does

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
question if you lower the front does

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
question if you lower the front does
that<00:00:50.250> change<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> dynamic<00:00:50.730> balance<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that change the dynamic balance in the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.330 
that change the dynamic balance in the
way<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> forks<00:00:52.410> were<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.770> affect<00:00:53.070> sag

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
way that the forks were can affect sag

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
way that the forks were can affect sag
and<00:00:53.610> compression<00:00:54.539> yes<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.350> does<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and compression yes it does because you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
and compression yes it does because you
change<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> overall<00:00:56.699> balance<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> bike

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
change the overall balance of the bike

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.889 
change the overall balance of the bike
however<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.579> minimal<00:01:00.120> change<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> not

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
however it is a minimal change it is not

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.880 
however it is a minimal change it is not
a<00:01:01.550> jump<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> cliff<00:01:03.080> change<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.680> would

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a jump off a cliff change as you would

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.660 
a jump off a cliff change as you would
think<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.240> were<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.750> move<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.590> forks<00:01:08.010> two

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
think if you were to move the forks two

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
think if you were to move the forks two
or<00:01:08.790> three<00:01:09.030> millimeters<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.470> order<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> get

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
or three millimeters in order to get

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
or three millimeters in order to get
something<00:01:11.430> profound<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
something profound you would have to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
something profound you would have to
move<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> forks<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.729> considerable<00:01:15.540> distance

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
move the forks a considerable distance

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
move the forks a considerable distance
and<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:16.950> days<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.430> measurements<00:01:17.909> being

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and these days with measurements being

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
and these days with measurements being
so<00:01:18.240> tight<00:01:18.570> frames<00:01:19.080> been<00:01:19.350> specifically

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so tight frames been specifically

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.030 
so tight frames been specifically
designed<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.880> application<00:01:21.530> your<00:01:22.530> limit

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
designed for an application your limit

designed for an application your limit
of<00:01:23.220> movement<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> actually<00:01:24.390> quite<00:01:24.990> small<00:01:25.580> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
of movement is actually quite small the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
of movement is actually quite small the
last<00:01:26.820> thing<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.600> tire<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.380> hit

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
last thing you want is your tire to hit

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
last thing you want is your tire to hit
a<00:01:28.560> cylinder<00:01:29.040> head<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.780> radiator<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.290> cause

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
a cylinder head or a radiator and cause

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.060 
a cylinder head or a radiator and cause
an<00:01:32.159> accident<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.000> moving<00:01:33.869> geometry<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
an accident so moving geometry in the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
an accident so moving geometry in the
front<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> bike<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.600> limited<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
front of the bike is very limited in

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
front of the bike is very limited in
what<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> therefore<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
what you can do and therefore the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.429 
what you can do and therefore the
effects<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> way<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.979> sag<00:01:41.310> might<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
effects in the way that sag might be

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
effects in the way that sag might be
altered<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> change<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.729> balance

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
altered because of the change of balance

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.929 
altered because of the change of balance
it's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.930> very<00:01:46.110> small<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.670> rear

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it's going to be very small in the rear

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.539 
it's going to be very small in the rear
of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> bike<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.869> looking<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:50.250> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of the bike you're looking at if for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
of the bike you're looking at if for
example<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.119> change<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.689> ride<00:01:51.930> height<00:01:52.200> then

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
example you change your ride height then

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
example you change your ride height then
yes<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.759> alter<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> balance<00:01:54.390> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
yes you're going to alter the balance of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
yes you're going to alter the balance of
the<00:01:54.750> bike<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.579> because<00:01:56.579> you're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the bike a little bit because you're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490 
the bike a little bit because you're
extending<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> shock<00:01:57.630> length<00:01:57.869> therefore

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
extending the shock length therefore

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.039 
extending the shock length therefore
moving<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> weight<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> bonus'<00:02:00.600> cycle<00:02:00.930> or

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
moving the weight of the bonus' cycle or

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
moving the weight of the bonus' cycle or
the<00:02:01.200> balance<00:02:01.560> point<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> motorcycle

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the balance point of the motorcycle

about an hour long and I think we got
