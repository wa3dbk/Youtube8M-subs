the<00:01:09.119> easiest<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> deal<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the easiest way to deal with them is to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.640 
the easiest way to deal with them is to
run<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> side<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.299> don't<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
run out to the side I don't do that in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.080 
run out to the side I don't do that in
this<00:01:13.740> video<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:14.939> lucky
