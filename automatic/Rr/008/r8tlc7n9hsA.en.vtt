though this is rapid-fire on it blinged

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.370 
though this is rapid-fire on it blinged
out<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.800> silencer<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.730> rapid<00:02:18.030> fire<00:02:18.380> that's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
out with silencer and rapid fire that's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.980 
out with silencer and rapid fire that's
pretty<00:02:19.709> tight<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.820> how<00:02:21.630> did<00:02:21.690> they<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
pretty tight what how did they get a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.930 
pretty tight what how did they get a
Harrier<00:02:22.410> none<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.190> them<00:02:23.310> even<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.610> seven

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
Harrier none of them even have seven

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.350 
Harrier none of them even have seven
kills<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.800> them<00:02:25.890> has<00:02:26.010> six<00:02:26.280> kills<00:02:26.610> it's

kills one of them has six kills it's
probably<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> care<00:02:27.959> package<00:02:28.170> isn't<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:33.290> knife

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
probably a care package isn't it a knife

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
and the saying when you have the option
of<00:02:52.560> no<00:02:52.709> recoil<00:02:53.100> or<00:02:53.459> little<00:02:53.910> recoil<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
of no recoil or little recoil it's a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.729 
of no recoil or little recoil it's a
little<00:02:55.380> bit<00:02:55.470> better

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
little bit better

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.780 
little bit better
I<00:02:56.209> know<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.510> newbie<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.110> be<00:02:58.260> using<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:59.130> low

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
I know it's newbie to be using a low

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
I know it's newbie to be using a low
recoil<00:03:00.030> gone<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.690> still<00:03:02.209> it's<00:03:03.209> mono<00:03:03.420> warfare

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
recoil gone but still it's mono warfare

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.490 
recoil gone but still it's mono warfare
-<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.320> everything's<00:03:04.920> newbie<00:03:06.200> all<00:03:07.200> right<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.470> I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
- so everything's newbie all right so I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.840 
- so everything's newbie all right so I
have<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> paper<00:03:08.010> right<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> reason<00:03:08.790> I'm

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
have a paper right now the reason I'm

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.910 
have a paper right now the reason I'm
calling<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.630> Harriers<00:03:10.350> shoot<00:03:10.709> down

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
calling is because Harriers shoot down

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440 
calling is because Harriers shoot down
pay<00:03:11.160> blows<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.670> chopper<00:03:11.910> gunners<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> case

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
pay blows and chopper gunners the case

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.890 
pay blows and chopper gunners the case
you<00:03:12.570> guys<00:03:12.690> didn't<00:03:12.930> know<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.390> don't

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
want to have that up in the air at the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.759 
want to have that up in the air at the
same<00:03:17.280> time<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.640> an<00:03:17.730> enemy<00:03:17.880> paid<00:03:18.209> law<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:19.410> now

dude fucking I thought I was gonna have
to<00:04:36.710> deal<00:04:37.010> with<00:04:37.160> some<00:04:37.340> major<00:04:38.270> air<00:04:38.419> support<00:04:38.990> and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
to deal with some major air support and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.840 
to deal with some major air support and
turned<00:04:39.889> out<00:04:40.039> just<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.310> be<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.430> wimpy<00:04:40.729> little

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
turned out just to be a wimpy little
