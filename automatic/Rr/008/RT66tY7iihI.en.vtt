00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 a wonderful good day my 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 Dear friends, I greet you warmly 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.000
 to this video of me in the me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.740
 once talk about the women's logic 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
 and she wants to help you with a few 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 I would like to explain some examples to you 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.139
 your girlfriend maybe a little better 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.270
 understand and recognize 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.720
 there is a really mega cash register logic 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.330
 behind everything is very easy 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.519
 january declares itself the woman is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 Logica a very simple logic and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 easier than the math or others 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 things that can be explained logically and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 if you follow a few things then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.300
 are you just gonna make your girlfriend better? 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 understand and if you just one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 have a bit of sensitivity and not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 showering eyes so liked that then says 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.420
 would actually have become all 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.129
 and then punish cdu and the firing 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.649
 not first, of course, must 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 know that the woman logic is a very 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.550
 can offer a wide spectrum 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 different departments and that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.890
 of course every woman in her own way 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.539
 But it were their female logic fills 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.189
 there is a reason trunk and if you are 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.840
 You can already see that a lot 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.880
 enough stress and then I understand 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
 even friend much better 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 exactly the first example is for 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 example that the women say hey me 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.509
 I do not want flowers from you and me 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.490
 I do not want any presents from you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.590
 but who thinks to logic 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.100
 which person does not want flowers 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.299
 First of all, more and my wife 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.460
 she just does not want to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 openly and honestly admit that you are her 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 to give flowers because now he is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 this surprise effect away and when 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 she just lets herself go by herself 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.299
 says she would like to have flowers then 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 is it stupid if you have to yes 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.380
 only passed and if you do not have time 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.360
 then she can say before she has 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 thought of me and that is so great and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 shows surprise effect there and you 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 stand well there the same 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 We have a phenomenon with the chocolate 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.409
 The chocolate is very versatile 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.149
 and especially in women's logic in 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.850
 several views represent the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.369
 Chocolate is a phenomenon what the woman 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 not want to have at home 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.939
 so that she is, because if so 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.350
 when the chocolate is at home 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.670
 then I have to eat them too 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.469
 My they can not simply because 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 wither away without me and it 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.979
 is also a comrade scenes is you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.900
 maybe not very advantageous 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.720
 if you chalk every day so easily 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 That's why chocolate is not available 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 kings founder upwards 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.810
 but if a girl or the woman says 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.910
 she does not want to have chocolate 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.830
 you think of the situation when the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 situation is okay 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.910
 she has her days she feels anyway 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.709
 already shit and fat and ugly 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.660
 then I have to buy chocolate now 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 so she still feels crappy 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 although that's actually what that is 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.370
 so the girls want theirs if they want theirs 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.900
 she just wants to spend her days 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 feel worse and a little bit more 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.489
 more compassion therefore always harder 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.379
 chocolate but if not and she says so 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.940
 I do not want to have chocolate and 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.680
 she does not have her days or not 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 any situation is where you get this 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
 chocolate really needs to be easy 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 to prevent with nervous breakdown 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 then do not buy chocolate 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.900
 so that you will not make fun 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.879
 but rather create stress 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.099
 which friend kindes not the man is 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.870
 It does not matter what it is 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.819
 perfectly clear once you've got to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.739
 able to put something on the man 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.000
 must always blame because it is 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.170
 much easier to blame for one 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.530
 others so projected 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.140
 you do that as well if you do 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.030
 not long can you think of japan 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.830
 yes, I'm just too sweet and you 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.629
 want to have the asshole fucking women 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.700
 They all want that assholes 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.290
 best example of what there is but what 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.849
 not true so it's true of course 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.650
 because you have a bit of contra 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.269
 But that does not mean that one does 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.980
 an asshole really wants something 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.720
 properly done or right 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.110
 really fooled about it wants something 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.159
 but no woman wants a woman 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.780
 professional have the had a bit 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.549
 can go against what is not called 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.950
 that one loves so much is pushing here 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.480
 the blame for the women in which he says 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 she wants to claim the railway what 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.430
 Losing slaughter is easy if it is 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.689
 does not fit then does not fit and then 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.580
 you also have to look for an excuse 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.870
 and so we do it just in the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.709
 be a case if you share it 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.650
 indebtedness 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.959
 you write your joy and within 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.830
 of the day can always change 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.599
 and change 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.580
 Sometimes she writes with smileys 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.680
 she writes without smileys but you will 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.180
 you also cost situation 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.780
 then you have to think a bit 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.120
 put you back in the woman again 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.010
 it's not that bad you stop 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.690
 this route logic did not notice 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.240
 and my rap is just that 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.520
 just because you do not write the smileys 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.590
 Woman is not easily mad or something like that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.419
 does not always mean by the tracks 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.800
 sometimes you just look if you are 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.000
 for example something writes and 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.190
 actually already something 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.510
 happened or you know mine 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.970
 girlfriends are in a dangerous 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.889
 situation has just rewritten 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.050
 be packed then you have to 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.690
 you have a bit of sensitivity 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.340
 and think twice if she really does 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.880
 so far, or maybe not 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.770
 even a no just because they have no 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.750
 It does not always mean smiley writes 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.410
 because sometimes it is like that who understands 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.540
 not that one 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.580
 today 's situation you want at 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.680
 order delivery service and you ask 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.940
 your girlfriend what you want yours 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.830
 and she does not say nee but maybe 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.510
 I can a bit at the join 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.810
 then it is very bad that is 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.250
 but fully fully logically most 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.900
 no big helping she would like too 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.520
 No small portion of sunshine would like to stop 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.669
 just snack if you feel like and 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 that's fine for her 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.300
 certain better and is generally for that 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.710
 know better 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.810
 yes and she just has a better one 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.760
 you are what you eat and if you are 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.880
 do you think is like me then you are 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.160
 less under figure another 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.830
 example is the brackets poll each 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.330
 Every man every man knows her true 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.740
 for hours on your girlfriend and you 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.870
 just can not decide 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.669
 what you want to wear but also that 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.650
 Part of a lobby child while the woman 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.600
 just want the nicest on 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.490
 be evening and she does not know which 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.050
 combi best fit together somehow 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.270
 what can you combine best? 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.410
 wanted that tomorrow because the figure 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.560
 Yes, it can change from one to the other 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.750
 completely change even if only 200 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.370
 less or more like the figure 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.650
 may have completely changed and 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.820
 suddenly makes some upholstery in 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.860
 who were not there before 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.110
 and that's why you have to come which combination 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.970
 best fits your daily figure 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.390
 And from that help him from her friend 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.010
 because he's still a friend today 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.930
 to look at them and that's why 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.150
 you just look but if they are you 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.710
 ask if you like these shoes or these 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.370
 put on shoes but they should 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.650
 cliche 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.810
 then you have to favor these shoes 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.670
 filming it out is not like that 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.040
 hard you just have to 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.500
 put the past situation into perspective and 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.450
 Just cover the shoes, wear them 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.660
 actually always so but that says it 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.340
 not so simply say these shoes 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.260
 But they fit really well with the outfit 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.120
 and if she asks if not this 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.180
 shoes fit better then you say 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.220
 Yes sweetheart 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.660
 no kidding the better you have to 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.310
 you always closely the situation of the woman 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:58.590
 put in and then that's one 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.880
 super easy, of course i hope so 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.980
 could you guys with this video 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.050
 a bit to bring the woman closer to logic and 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.150
 I think so with all of you 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.880
 misunderstandings that had or one 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.400
 few tech-blog could solve and now
