slash 4x4 and I made - Stampede 4x4 the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
slash 4x4 and I made - Stampede 4x4 the
only<00:00:20.430> thing<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:20.939> different<00:00:21.240> than<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
stampede 4x4 is the front bumper because

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.630 
stampede 4x4 is the front bumper because
it's<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.070> shorter<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:31.320> rear<00:00:31.560> Willy<00:00:32.009> bar<00:00:32.340> or

whatever you want to do it just looks

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.110 
whatever you want to do it just looks
better<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> wheelie<00:00:37.380> bar<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.270 

let's<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.660> else<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.920> radio

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
let's see what else is there the radio

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.170 
let's see what else is there the radio
box<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.120> chassis<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.100> battery<00:00:47.100> strap<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:49.160> I

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
box the chassis the battery strap and I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680 
box the chassis the battery strap and I
think<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:52.250> all<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> had<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.629> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
slash 4x4 mounts right there

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.649 
slash 4x4 mounts right there
so<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.680> use<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:49.860> slash<00:01:50.280> 4x4<00:01:50.970> mountain<00:01:51.509> just
