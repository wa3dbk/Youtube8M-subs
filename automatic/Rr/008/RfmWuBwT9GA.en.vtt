00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 very good friends we are back here 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.660
 in the garage we are going to talk about the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.520
 audi s 7 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.400
 it's the first time I drive this 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.039
 version that is the v8 version of the audi 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.380
 a7 that transforms it puts a sy 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.830
 it makes all the difference in the world what 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.440
 transforms on the 17 the design of the 7 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.269
 I still love it I like it I like it 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.780
 I know a lot that there are many people 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:41.900
 prefers to 5 o'clock I do not prefer this 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.320
 car in gmail seems so elegant to me 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.910
 so well accomplished is it is one of those 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 cars that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 they were born later and they knew how to take advantage 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.350
 the fact that they were born later to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 what do I mean the creator of the idea of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.059
 the convertible coupes forgiveness of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.580
 four-door coupes was mercedes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.619
 benz with the cls of the first generation 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.470
 is already in the second or third 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.020
 generation of the cls but the one of the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.550
 first was he who created that notion the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.260
 car was so successful 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.380
 other brands had to do things 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.550
 similar 20w did for example the cr6 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.460
 great coupe and audio did the a7 in my 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.570
 particular opinion 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.180
 evil the student surpassed the teacher me 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.310
 it looks much more refined elegant 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 sober at the same time sporty 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.430
 cls and also that the big coupÃ© besides 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.700
 has another huge advantage is a 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.170
 hatchback like the 370z this is 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.880
 a car whose whose medallion is also 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.070
 raise 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 so that we have access to the interior of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.770
 car then you have 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.219
 the playful aspect of the design you have the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.409
 practical aspect of handling and you have the 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.450
 also playful aspect of the handling and 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.549
 practical aspect of a large drawer the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.530
 access to the interior fold the seats 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.780
 you can load many things and so on 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.269
 you're hardly going to buy a 17 for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 load things but if you want to do it 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.190
 there is a little plant here 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 of small refurbishment and inside you have what 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.800
 what do you expect from an audi the finished 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.280
 impeccable 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.160
 in the specific case the audio people 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.160
 and put skin seats with cancer 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.000
 in which the detractors of the skin 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.730
 they are going to put that 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 let's say because the alcantara does not 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.100
 It gets so hot on hot days 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.130
 like as the traditional skin 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.640
 well maybe let's say it does not burn so much 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.230
 but but if it heats up 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.100
 inside we get in and we have to insist 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.040
 the impeccable audio finishes 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.490
 everything is well done everything is beautiful everything 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.360
 is in place the brightness shines when 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.880
 must do it that is to say here we have 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.310
 some touches of the black piano there is no 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.380
 excesses here we have 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.660
 carbon fiber a plastic imitating 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.360
 carbon fiber I do not know which of the 12 to 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.670
 these aluminum really if you turn on the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.569
 car here with this button 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.969
 and it's going to unfold 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.810
 and soon the screen we will learn the 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.819
 stereo 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.410
 here the screen in the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.590
 screen has the navigation system 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.599
 has sound by bluetooth you have is not 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.870
 a touch screen you already have to 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.480
 work everything here forgiveness control 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.230
 all through this button or through 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.230
 of this one 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.620
 let's say screen that lets you draw 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.360
 things and access some numbers of a 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.890
 fast way radio memory and things 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.900
 like that you can do it through 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.910
 from this screen the front 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.450
 parking is electric and this 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.400
 button is to activate or deactivate the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.950
 automatic disconnection of the cylinders 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.920
 because under the hood is the v8 engine 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.180
 4 liters with 420 horsepower that engine 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.210
 has the disconnection system 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.970
 automatic cylinders rather from 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.290
 auto hitchhiking and I'm confusing 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.080
 things is not automatic disconnection 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.540
 the cylinder but auto start-stop 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 bridge seems at a traffic light the car is 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.530
 but it takes a while to start 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.470
 those seconds that the car is late 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.990
 undertake take away some agility in 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.000
 the transit opens the traffic light and the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.610
 back is going to whistle you because you still do not 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.610
 it starts until once it starts it's going 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.370
 to be at 100 kilometers per hour in 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.380
 less than 5 seconds that's how it is 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.200
 capacity this car we have a box 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.540
 automatic 7-speed double 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.760
 clutch the stronic works pretty 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.370
 well as automatic also works 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.730
 very good at extracting juice 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.370
 engine the durability of the boxes 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.250
 double clutch has been questioned and not 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.110
 I understand and that can be a point in 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.880
 against if you want to buy this car 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.500
 to have it for about ten years but 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.170
 most have it for three or four and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.010
 that's why it's going to be more than enough 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.050
 now many people may think that 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.060
 talking about a four-door coupe and 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.480
 because it is called cope because the roof 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.670
 it tilts in a very accentuated way 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.520
 backwards and that transforms it 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.340
 according to the technical markets in 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.380
 in cooper but I feel here and I'm 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.560
 pretty good look at the space for 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.080
 head is enough is not broad but 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 is enough or do I even have to 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.900
 a fist up here this part 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.810
 appears the protrusion that allows 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.460
 the sunroof open and cluttering tantito 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.500
 but here back I'm fine I have a good 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.900
 space of science adjusted for me and 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.510
 I have good space also there is not 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.770
 for five people say they do not fit 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.389
 three people here back because neither 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.090
 even a seat that gave me a 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.460
 console but overall it's fine 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.430
 then the car is handled well it looks 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.790
 well it feels good that's one of my 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.970
 favorite cars of always that is is one 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.820
 from my favorite cars the one that has 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.720
 accompanied here in the garage for 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.150
 he knows a lot of time 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.980
 to me the audios I like a lot of the 5 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.890
 up from 5 down do not I 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.870
 They seem so interesting but in the 7 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:45.160
 in a specific way and more that 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.690
 version with engine already 8 repeat 420 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.850
 horses is simply made 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.440
 sensational the car is nice the car 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.620
 he handles well he is comfortable he is well 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.130
 finished is nice the only thing that I 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.530
 I would put this version is the sound 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.080
 Optional winemakers go on it costs almost 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.200
 10 thousand dollars but there are which ones that 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.510
 it's worth it 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.140
 the basic sound of is signed by you 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.690
 it's a good sound but when you meet 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.900
 the best does not want to return to what 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.900
 it's just good we go to a cut and 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.700
 let's talk about the exotic Italian that 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.920
 is here behind the maserati ghibli 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.120
 also a whole attraction here in the 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.120
 garage right now we
