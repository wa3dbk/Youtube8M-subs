00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
right and you're gonna get the same kind
of<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.110> could<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.380> lines<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.100> I'll<00:01:23.220> move

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
of thing we could do lines but I'll move

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
of thing we could do lines but I'll move
on<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.210> later<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
on to that a little bit later on the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.870 
on to that a little bit later on the
next<00:01:25.409> thing<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> dot<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> look<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
next thing is a dot if you look like a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
next thing is a dot if you look like a
nice<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.299> circle<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> center<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> your

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
nice little circle in the center of your

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
nice little circle in the center of your
flag<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> banner<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.329> actually

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
flag or your banner you can actually

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
flag or your banner you can actually
just<00:01:30.780> pop<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.320> die<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> center<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
just pop the die in the center and the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
just pop the die in the center and the
banner<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.689> anywhere<00:01:34.200> else<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
banner can go anywhere else in the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.230 
banner can go anywhere else in the
crafting<00:01:35.130> table<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
crafting table you have to do this in a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
crafting table you have to do this in a
3x3<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.079> far<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.470> aware<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.400> how

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
3x3 as far as I'm aware and that's how

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.200 
3x3 as far as I'm aware and that's how
that<00:01:38.640> works

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that works

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.090 
that works
next<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> diamond<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> should

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
next up we got a diamond so I should

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.950 
next up we got a diamond so I should
expect<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> create<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> diamond<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
expect you have to create a diamond and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.569 
expect you have to create a diamond and
you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> pop<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> banner<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you have to pop a banner right into the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
you have to pop a banner right into the
center<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.780> create<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
center of that and it will create the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
center of that and it will create the
diamond<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.070> center<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.729> find<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
diamond in the center of it I find the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
diamond in the center of it I find the
odd<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> you'd<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.170> diamond<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
odd that you'd put the diamond on the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440 
odd that you'd put the diamond on the
outside<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> outside

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
outside but it doesn't do that outside

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
outside but it doesn't do that outside
and<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> inside<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> different<00:01:52.649> color<00:01:52.860> but

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and the inside is a different color but

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
and the inside is a different color but
your<00:01:53.549> brain<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.060> work<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
your brain can work it how and you can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
your brain can work it how and you can
work<00:01:55.079> out<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.950> need<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
work out what all do you need to do it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.950 
work out what all do you need to do it
in<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> results<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.930> after

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
in to get the results that you're after

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620 
in to get the results that you're after
and<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> next<00:01:59.219> thing<00:01:59.430> I'm<00:01:59.880> pretty<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and the next thing I'm pretty sure I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
and the next thing I'm pretty sure I
must<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.899> seen<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.290> somewhere<00:02:01.530> before<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
must have seen this somewhere before I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.940 
must have seen this somewhere before I
don't<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.119> where<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.560> banner

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
don't know where but this this banner

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
don't know where but this this banner
looks<00:02:05.310> somewhat<00:02:05.850> familiar<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.869> one's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
looks somewhat familiar and this one's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.630 
looks somewhat familiar and this one's
quite<00:02:07.290> cool<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.920> said<00:02:08.129> those<00:02:08.340> heads

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
quite cool so like I said those heads

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.580 
quite cool so like I said those heads
now<00:02:08.789> spawn<00:02:09.119> randomly<00:02:09.300> into<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> world<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
now spawn randomly into the world or you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.670 
now spawn randomly into the world or you
can<00:02:10.709> actually<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.039> them<00:02:11.160> off<00:02:11.250> drop

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
can actually get them off drop

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.770 
can actually get them off drop
and<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.219> actually<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.819> by<00:02:13.060> simply<00:02:13.329> just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and you actually do this by simply just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.569 
and you actually do this by simply just
getting<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.170> banner<00:02:14.379> throwing<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.250> creeper

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
getting the banner throwing the creeper

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.459 
getting the banner throwing the creeper
head<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.939> and<00:02:16.180> that's<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.719> you<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.109> now<00:02:17.439> you

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
head in and that's what you get now you

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.990 
head in and that's what you get now you
can<00:02:17.590> actually<00:02:17.890> use<00:02:18.189> with<00:02:18.430> their<00:02:18.609> heads<00:02:18.790> as

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
can actually use with their heads as

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
can actually use with their heads as
well<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.659> you<00:02:19.810> throw<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.469> with<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.739> banner

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
well and you throw that in with a banner

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.649 
well and you throw that in with a banner
and<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.609> get<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.879> really<00:02:22.180> cool<00:02:22.209> with<00:02:22.629> a

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
and you get this really cool with a

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.420 
and you get this really cool with a
school<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.349> crossbones<00:02:23.920> which<00:02:24.129> I<00:02:24.219> think

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
school and crossbones which I think

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.429 
school and crossbones which I think
which<00:02:24.790> i<00:02:24.909> think<00:02:24.969> is<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.329> good<00:02:25.689> I<00:02:25.900> could<00:02:26.319> see

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
which i think is really good I could see

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.170 
which i think is really good I could see
many<00:02:26.680> many<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.159> pirate<00:02:27.640> ship<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.030> on

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
many many a pirate ship now on

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.360 
many many a pirate ship now on
multiplayer<00:02:28.689> servers<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.709> these<00:02:29.950> draped

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
multiplayer servers with these draped

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
multiplayer servers with these draped
all<00:02:30.670> over<00:02:30.730> them<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:31.780> over<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.379> or<00:02:32.469> maybe

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
all over them all over them or maybe

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.649 
all over them all over them or maybe
over<00:02:32.799> their<00:02:32.980> bases<00:02:33.459> as<00:02:33.609> well<00:02:33.849> something<00:02:34.450> to

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
over their bases as well something to

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.449 
over their bases as well something to
know<00:02:34.780> actually<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.799> tried<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.129> zombie

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
know actually is I have tried the zombie

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.429 
know actually is I have tried the zombie

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
if a horizontal arrow works as well I'm

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.670 
if a horizontal arrow works as well I'm
really<00:02:57.730> intrigued<00:02:58.090> by<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.269> no<00:02:59.139> it<00:02:59.290> doesn't

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
okay that's actually a really big

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.509 
okay that's actually a really big
surprise<00:03:02.169> I<00:03:02.620> thought<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.980> might<00:03:03.129> do<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.459> you

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
surprise I thought it might do so you

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.179 
surprise I thought it might do so you
can<00:03:03.639> do<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> vertical<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.659> a<00:03:04.959> downward<00:03:05.200> one<00:03:05.680> but

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
can do a vertical and a downward one but

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.129 
can do a vertical and a downward one but
you<00:03:06.280> can't<00:03:06.549> do<00:03:06.639> a<00:03:06.669> sideways<00:03:07.000> one<00:03:07.450> oh<00:03:07.719> that's

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
you can't do a sideways one oh that's

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.030 
you can't do a sideways one oh that's
disappointing

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
disappointing

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.409 
disappointing
well<00:03:09.310> nevermind<00:03:09.700> then<00:03:09.819> so<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.209> go<00:03:10.299> at

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
well nevermind then so there you go at

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.699 
well nevermind then so there you go at
least<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.659> know<00:03:10.780> your<00:03:10.930> limitations<00:03:11.319> on<00:03:11.680> that

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
least you know your limitations on that

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.800 
least you know your limitations on that
one<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.849> one<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> more<00:03:13.359> fancy

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
one and this is one of the more fancy

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.899 
one and this is one of the more fancy
ones<00:03:13.989> this<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.319> actually<00:03:14.620> pretty<00:03:15.340> easy<00:03:15.459> to

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
ones this is actually pretty easy to

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.939 
ones this is actually pretty easy to
guess<00:03:16.120> how<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.389> make<00:03:16.659> this<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.590> simply

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
guess how you make this one you simply

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.189 
guess how you make this one you simply
get<00:03:18.159> for<00:03:18.400> example<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.940> green<00:03:19.209> banner<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.019> get<00:03:20.169> a

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
get for example a green banner you get a

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.930 
get for example a green banner you get a
bit<00:03:20.409> of<00:03:20.560> brick<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.159> it<00:03:21.280> actually<00:03:21.400> gives<00:03:21.729> you<00:03:21.819> a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
bit of brick and it actually gives you a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.300 
bit of brick and it actually gives you a
brick<00:03:22.359> patterned<00:03:22.900> green<00:03:23.290> banner<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.919> don't

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
brick patterned green banner I don't

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.740 
brick patterned green banner I don't
know<00:03:24.400> if<00:03:24.459> there's<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.669> way<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:24.970> choosing<00:03:25.540> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
know if there's a way of choosing the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.330 
know if there's a way of choosing the
other<00:03:25.930> color<00:03:26.199> because<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.620> mean<00:03:26.769> with<00:03:26.889> this<00:03:27.069> one

what<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> did<00:03:40.379> was<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.769> got<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> white<00:03:41.189> banner<00:03:41.489> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
what I did was I got a white banner and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.339 
what I did was I got a white banner and
and<00:03:42.180> inside<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.720> bricks<00:03:42.959> were<00:03:43.079> going<00:03:43.140> to

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
and inside that the bricks were going to

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.229 
and inside that the bricks were going to
be<00:03:43.439> a<00:03:43.470> lapis<00:03:43.829> lazuli<00:03:43.920> color<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.760> then<00:03:45.150> I

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
be a lapis lazuli color and then I

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.429 
be a lapis lazuli color and then I
decided<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.659> I<00:03:45.780> was<00:03:45.840> gonna<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.230> brick

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
decided that I was gonna have the brick

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.440 
decided that I was gonna have the brick
texture<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.129> that's<00:03:47.579> how<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.239> which

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
texture and that's how I got that which

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.720 
texture and that's how I got that which
was<00:03:48.599> very<00:03:48.750> very<00:03:48.870> cool<00:03:49.319> now<00:03:49.980> onto<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> slightly

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
was very very cool now onto a slightly

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
was very very cool now onto a slightly
more<00:03:50.879> difficult<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.510> how<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.870> hell<00:03:52.200> did<00:03:52.379> I

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
more difficult one how the hell did I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.229

I<00:04:01.859> can<00:04:02.129> show<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.310> some<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> combinations

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
I can show you some of the combinations

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.420 
I can show you some of the combinations
so<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.290> either<00:04:04.379> pop<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.769> banner<00:04:04.980> into

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
so you can either pop the banner into

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.550 
so you can either pop the banner into
say<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.909> bottom<00:04:06.090> right<00:04:06.389> corner<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.530> can

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
say the bottom right corner and you can

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.160 
say the bottom right corner and you can
do<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.519> which<00:04:08.909> makes<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.239> whole<00:04:09.269> diagonal

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
do that which makes the whole diagonal

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.050 
do that which makes the whole diagonal
line<00:04:10.409> and<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.040> do<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.310> same<00:04:11.459> again<00:04:11.819> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
line and you can do the same again and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.759 
line and you can do the same again and
pop<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:12.659> there<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.620> you'd

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
pop that just there and then as you'd

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.349 
pop that just there and then as you'd
expect<00:04:14.129> if<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> want<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> vertical<00:04:15.180> one

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
expect if you want to do a vertical one

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.120 
expect if you want to do a vertical one
then<00:04:15.659> that's<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.989> same<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
then that's the same as that and a

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.219 
then that's the same as that and a
horizontal<00:04:17.789> line<00:04:17.940> as<00:04:18.090> well<00:04:18.299> gives<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.049> that

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
horizontal line as well gives you that

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.599 
horizontal line as well gives you that
and<00:04:19.380> obviously<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.919> got<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.070> blue<00:04:20.340> banner

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
and obviously I just got a blue banner

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.909 
and obviously I just got a blue banner
did<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.209> numerous<00:04:21.599> times<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:22.229> eventually<00:04:22.740> I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
did that numerous times and eventually I

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.409 
did that numerous times and eventually I
ended<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.490> with<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.820> which<00:04:24.090> i<00:04:24.180> think<00:04:24.240> is

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
ended up with that which i think is

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.629 
ended up with that which i think is
pretty<00:04:24.599> cool<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.530> one<00:04:25.800> other

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
pretty cool so that's that one other

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.580 
pretty cool so that's that one other
than<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.180> course<00:04:27.780> I've<00:04:27.990> got<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.169> Germany

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
than that of course I've got the Germany

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.620 
than that of course I've got the Germany
flag<00:04:28.860> now<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.099> reason<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.490> did<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:29.880> with<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> red

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
flag now the reason I did it with a red

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.839 
flag now the reason I did it with a red
flag<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.590> not<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.860> black<00:04:32.160> flag<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.639> did<00:04:32.729> the

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
flag and not a black flag and did the

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.790 
flag and not a black flag and did the
other<00:04:33.030> colors<00:04:33.300> over<00:04:33.509> the<00:04:33.599> top<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.320> because

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
other colors over the top is because

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.650 
other colors over the top is because
when<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.280> do<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.820> makes<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> line<00:04:36.330> quite

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
when you do that it makes the line quite

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.960 
when you do that it makes the line quite
thin<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.320> was<00:04:37.440> what<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.620> initially<00:04:37.889> tried<00:04:38.370> so

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
thin that was what I initially tried so

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.490 
thin that was what I initially tried so
I<00:04:39.000> had<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.330> get<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.449> red<00:04:39.690> banner<00:04:39.930> because<00:04:40.169> if<00:04:40.410> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
I had to get a red banner because if you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500 
I had to get a red banner because if you
do<00:04:40.650> them<00:04:40.770> across<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.160> top<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.669> bottom<00:04:41.820> it

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
do them across the top and the bottom it

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.270 
do them across the top and the bottom it
fills<00:04:42.780> out<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> proper<00:04:43.530> third<00:04:43.830> whereas

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
fills out a proper third whereas

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.430 
fills out a proper third whereas
obviously<00:04:44.400> if<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:44.760> do<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.090> with<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.260> banner

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
obviously if you do it with the banner

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.649 
obviously if you do it with the banner
in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.650> top<00:04:46.889> corner<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.430> then<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.669> line<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.300> dye

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
in the top corner and then a line of dye

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.540 
in the top corner and then a line of dye
then<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.320> get<00:04:49.470> quite<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> thin<00:04:50.039> one<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.370> that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
then you get quite a thin one so that

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550 
then you get quite a thin one so that
doesn't<00:04:50.880> really<00:04:51.060> work<00:04:51.330> as<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.320> placement

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
doesn't really work as for the placement

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.529 
doesn't really work as for the placement
of<00:04:52.949> these<00:04:53.130> it's<00:04:53.430> quite<00:04:53.639> easy<00:04:53.849> you<00:04:54.270> literally

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
of these it's quite easy you literally

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.240 
of these it's quite easy you literally
just<00:04:54.780> point<00:04:55.080> them<00:04:55.289> down<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.740> they<00:04:56.070> always

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
just point them down and they always

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.339 
just point them down and they always
place<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.360> they're<00:04:57.510> facing<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.229> the

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
place so they're facing you to the

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.140 
place so they're facing you to the
colored<00:04:58.740> side<00:04:58.949> of<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.190> banner<00:04:59.400> will<00:04:59.909> always

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
colored side of the banner will always

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.120 
colored side of the banner will always
be<00:05:00.270> facing<00:05:00.479> at<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:01.139> so<00:05:01.530> as<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:01.889> see<00:05:01.949> you

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
be facing at you so as you can see you

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.180 
be facing at you so as you can see you
basically<00:05:02.610> pop<00:05:03.120> them<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:03.659> complete<00:05:04.320> 360<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
basically pop them in complete 360 so

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.620 
basically pop them in complete 360 so
whichever<00:05:05.400> way<00:05:05.639> around<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.150> want<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.419> pop

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
whichever way around you want to pop

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.689 
whichever way around you want to pop
them<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.289> can<00:05:07.440> do<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.800> as<00:05:08.070> much<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.340> you'd

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
them you can do that as much as you'd

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.790 
them you can do that as much as you'd
like<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.840> think<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.440> pretty<00:05:10.620> much

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
like to and I think that is pretty much

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.080 
like to and I think that is pretty much
it<00:05:10.860> for<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.190> week<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.639> know<00:05:11.729> there<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.060> one

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.879 
it for this week I know there is one
more<00:05:12.300> banner<00:05:12.659> design<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.289> haven't<00:05:13.710> quite

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
more banner design that I haven't quite

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.740 
more banner design that I haven't quite
worked<00:05:13.949> out<00:05:14.400> I've<00:05:14.580> seen<00:05:14.729> tons<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.120> pictures<00:05:15.300> on

optimistic and for the future of
Minecraft<00:06:00.000> especially<00:06:00.360> when<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.540> comes<00:06:00.630> to

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
Minecraft especially when it comes to

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.060 
Minecraft especially when it comes to
the<00:06:00.840> servers<00:06:01.200> and<00:06:01.290> stuff<00:06:01.440> like<00:06:01.590> that<00:06:01.800> as<00:06:01.920> well

the servers and stuff like that as well
which<00:06:02.220> is<00:06:02.250> really<00:06:02.640> really<00:06:02.730> cool<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.270> the

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
which is really really cool and the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.330 
which is really really cool and the
final<00:06:04.020> thing<00:06:04.110> actually<00:06:04.320> is<00:06:04.830> if<00:06:05.130> you're<00:06:05.250> going

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340

to<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.550> video<00:06:05.760> settings<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.480> doesn't<00:06:06.780> seem<00:06:06.930> to

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
to the video settings it doesn't seem to

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.050 
to the video settings it doesn't seem to
do<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:07.230> currently<00:06:07.620> but<00:06:08.190> they<00:06:08.280> did<00:06:08.520> say<00:06:08.700> that<00:06:08.730> in

distance<00:06:15.990> up<00:06:16.440> to<00:06:16.620> 32<00:06:17.280> chunks<00:06:17.910> which<00:06:18.330> is<00:06:18.480> crazy

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
distance up to 32 chunks which is crazy

distance up to 32 chunks which is crazy
if<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:19.020> think<00:06:19.230> how<00:06:19.350> big<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.590> chunk<00:06:19.860> is<00:06:20.160> and<00:06:20.400> how
