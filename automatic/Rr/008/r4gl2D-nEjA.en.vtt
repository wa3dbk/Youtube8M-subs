00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:13.356
 Have you thought about how you discovered such a treasure? 

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.280
 The gods have plans for you. 

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:22.316
 They've determined your destiny. 

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.166
 I saw her strength with my own eyes. 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.648
 Sand drain turns time. 

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.902
 And only one who holds a dagger is aware of it. 

00:00:36.543 --> 00:00:37.990
 How did you do that? 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.470
 Only a dagger can unlock the sands of time. 

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:47.120
 And some would destroy the world by them. 

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:49.499
 Time absorbs everything. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.197
 We can only stop this destruction ... 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.532
 ... that we take the dagger to the secret castle of her guards. 

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.471
 We gotta get her there, Dastan. 

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.683
 You really enjoy being able to command me, right? 

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:05.942
 Just because you listen so nicely. 

00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:07.567
 Don't try your luck! 

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:10.330
 Hassansin. 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.276
 They sow terror in the hearts of everyone they meet. 

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:16.279
 Such a noble prince. 

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.057
 And rushes to help the beauty in danger. 

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.127
 Who said you were beautiful? 

00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:23.933
 There must be some reason you're not gonna take my eyes off me. 

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:26.944
 You're so ... I ... 

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.209
 Find him! 

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:39.280
 The tallest tower is protected by a demon. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.943
 Dastan, where's the dagger? 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.623
 You can search me. 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.686
 But thoroughly. 

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.602
 It's time. 

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:57.883
 We gotta get out of here. 

00:01:58.906 --> 00:01:59.960
 Without! 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
