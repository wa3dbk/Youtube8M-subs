not a coincidence that Gollum works so
well<00:05:07.240> in<00:05:07.419> comparison<00:05:07.570> with<00:05:08.020> something<00:05:08.289> like

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
well in comparison with something like

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.050 
well in comparison with something like
Jar<00:05:08.710> Jar<00:05:08.979> because<00:05:09.400> not<00:05:09.550> only<00:05:09.580> are<00:05:09.970> those

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
movies good which does help but Gollum
