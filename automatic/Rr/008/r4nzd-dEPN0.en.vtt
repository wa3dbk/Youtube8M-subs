00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.270 
cycle and so finally after two years and
I<00:02:59.660> know<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.959> took<00:03:00.110> me<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> long<00:03:00.500> time<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.830> figure

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
I know it took me a long time to figure

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.150 
I know it took me a long time to figure
this<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.610> okay<00:03:01.790> I'm<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> little<00:03:02.300> bit<00:03:02.510> slow<00:03:03.160> when

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
this out okay I'm a little bit slow when

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.650 
this out okay I'm a little bit slow when
it<00:03:04.250> comes<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.550> stuff<00:03:04.730> like<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.330> finally

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
it comes to stuff like this but finally

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.949 
it comes to stuff like this but finally
I<00:03:05.750> figured<00:03:05.930> out<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.380> two<00:03:06.560> years<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.959> every

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
I figured out for two years that every

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.590 
I figured out for two years that every
time<00:03:09.200> my<00:03:09.470> computer<00:03:09.920> said<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.970> corner<00:03:11.360> of

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
time my computer said in the corner of

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.120 
time my computer said in the corner of
the<00:03:11.720> screen<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.080> know<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.290> said<00:03:12.410> new<00:03:12.650> updates

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
the screen you know it said new updates

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.729 
the screen you know it said new updates
have<00:03:13.370> been<00:03:13.400> installed<00:03:14.110> okay<00:03:15.110> when<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
have been installed okay when that

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.190 
have been installed okay when that
happens<00:03:16.209> boom<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:17.480> when<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.750> shut<00:03:17.989> down

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
happens boom that's when you shut down

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.720 
happens boom that's when you shut down
that's<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:18.650> everything<00:03:18.890> freezes<00:03:19.250> that's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that's when everything freezes that's

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.190 
that's when everything freezes that's
when<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> crap<00:03:20.330> hits<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.630> fan

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
when the crap hits the fan

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.449 
when the crap hits the fan
because<00:03:21.560> when<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.830> new<00:03:21.950> updates<00:03:22.310> are

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
because when the new updates are

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.789 
because when the new updates are
installed<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:22.940> for<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.209> while<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.720> was<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.709> in

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
installed so for a while I was going in

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.590 
installed so for a while I was going in
there<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.070> just<00:03:25.160> deleting<00:03:25.850> or<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.510> know

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600

deactivating the new updates and that

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.420 
deactivating the new updates and that
worked<00:03:29.480> pretty<00:03:29.570> good<00:03:29.840> until<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:31.040> know<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430
