00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.160
 I do not think that basically 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.689
 it's about that both the club and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.840
 Qatar Foundation share the same 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:27.020
 values ​​the fact that through the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.020
 sport empower those young 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.230
 to practice different sports that 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.980
 can 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.650
 So dedicate yourself to a healthy life and power 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.489
 have the potential of tomorrow 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.870
 If things go well too, why not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.870
 people from the region especially from 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.019
 from the area of qatar power 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.059
 enhance this sport that is not so 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.059
 as empowered as in other places 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.950
 I think that ultimately are the values 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.440
 that one has had as a child 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.920
 the fact that good that a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.010
 institution like qatar foundation can 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 have also the necessary resources 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.909
 to help young people today 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.219
 it's a very big advantage maybe 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.219
 above all I would have liked 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.020
 also in my time to have or count 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.990
 with an institution so I can try 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.709
 to help that because obviously 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.090
 always in the economic resources and of 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.659
 infrastructures are always very 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.659
 important 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 I think that is the fundamental 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.780
 what I always say is that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.460
 to do something you have to have one 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.990
 to feel passion has to apasionarte 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.030
 I have not done 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.340
 the fact of playing football is what I 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 moves in the end is what really 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.360
 he is not for me 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.969
 come to train and it's not a sacrifice 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.750
 on the contrary I enjoy every day 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.269
 because the passion that one has from 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.720
 very small and good is something 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:16.620
 spectacular and I think that that moves 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.150
 to life in short, everything that 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.769
 one has to do the one he has to do 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.430
 because he is convinced because he really 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.430
 he is passionate 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.870
 especially considering the sport 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.860
 that one that is a practice that is a 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.860
 collective sport 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.780
 I do not know if this is going to look good but 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.300
 many times the fact of practicing from 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.070
 very small a collective sport perhaps 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.280
 teaches you much more than to go to 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.950
 school because the fact that one 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 start to say the values ​​you have 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.460
 a collective sport does not have one 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.750
 individual in the play next door 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.220
 when sharing is wrong 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.800
 a lot of things in fact we 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.800
 we share what is the basis of the game 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.490
 it's the ball we do not share it all 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.110
 time then have they say in 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.350
 definitive the collective sport has 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.020
 many values that 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.440
 let's say what you're going to wear during all your 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.390
 life and not only when you have to 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.910
 practice sports but when 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 really until you have to teach them to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.550
 your children a lot of the things and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.840
 educate them obviously 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.120
 and as you said 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.500
 sport always takes you on roads 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.540
 much healthier than not making us in 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.620
 definitive 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.849
 is what one always tries to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.260
 inculcate new children 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:49.549
 try to have a healthy life try 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.849
 compete to do different or sports 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.609
 so that you can also have your mind 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.609
 engaged in in things that really serve 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.450
 that ultimately 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.650
 nobody is born knowing 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.490
 you have to perfect yourself 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.070
 day by day and that obviously beyond 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.690
 that to reach a high level 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.480
 one has to have some dowries 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.480
 not only reach with them but day 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.790
 after day one has to put them and 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.090
 perfect them and in the end that's it 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.880
 do not try what 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.210
 every day feel that they can be a little 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.210
 best 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.780
 good to thank you especially for the 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.500
 different social networks always ground 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.650
 read different messages from people 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.430
 and obviously thank you because beyond 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.430
 of the distance 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.740
 let's say the barcelona is not from a country 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.020
 about a city is the world and 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.670
 belongs to the fans and the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.790
 amateurs are anywhere in the 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.070
 world and it is perfect that it be so 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.530
 in short, as I said before 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.190
 thank you for the support because always 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.130
 are behind the team and what good and what 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.250
 we will try to give you more joys 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.140
 like the one they have been coming 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.930
 enjoying in recent years 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.100
 qatar foundation and fc.barcelona page
