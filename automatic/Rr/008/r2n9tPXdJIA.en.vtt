00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.880 
and then you have the part of the youth
and<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.940> black<00:04:03.570> society<00:04:03.990> as<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.350> whole<00:04:04.440> which

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
and just black society as a whole which

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.170 
and just black society as a whole which
i<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.310> represented<00:04:05.940> through<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
i think is represented through the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.720 
i think is represented through the
character<00:04:06.720> Hillary<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:08.040> actually

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
character Hillary that actually

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.760 
character Hillary that actually
conscious<00:04:09.300> about<00:04:09.540> what's<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:10.620> know

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
conscious about what's going on you know

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.430 
conscious about what's going on you know
knows<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.460> tricks<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.330> trades<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
knows the tricks and the trades and the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.370 
knows the tricks and the trades and the
things<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:14.070> are<00:04:14.520> put<00:04:14.850> upon<00:04:15.000> our<00:04:15.420> people<00:04:15.720> to

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
things that are put upon our people to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.740 
things that are put upon our people to
basically<00:04:16.560> mess<00:04:17.190> us<00:04:17.370> up<00:04:17.549> as<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> whole<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.720> I

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
basically mess us up as a whole so I

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.460 
basically mess us up as a whole so I
think<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.230> boondocks<00:04:19.799> really<00:04:20.450> shows<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.989> lot

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
think the boondocks really shows a lot

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.890 
think the boondocks really shows a lot
of<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.220> ignorance<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.150> comes<00:04:24.450> out<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.750> our

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
of the ignorance that comes out of our

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.600 
of the ignorance that comes out of our
community

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
community

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.719 
community
it<00:04:25.849> shows<00:04:26.509> the<00:04:27.409> intelligence<00:04:28.280> but<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.550> shows

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
it shows the intelligence but it shows

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.029 
it shows the intelligence but it shows
ignorance<00:04:29.090> also<00:04:29.659> and<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.770> really

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
ignorance also and it's a really

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.100 
ignorance also and it's a really
well-balanced<00:04:32.030> show<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.270> know<00:04:32.629> it's<00:04:32.810> funny

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
well-balanced show you know it's funny

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.040 
well-balanced show you know it's funny

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.219 
own the DVDs but I like the message that
comes<00:04:40.430> across<00:04:40.610> from<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.389> because<00:04:41.629> you<00:04:41.780> get<00:04:41.960> a

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
comes across from it because you get a

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.550 
comes across from it because you get a
wide<00:04:42.860> range<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:43.520> perspectives<00:04:43.789> from<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.599> and
