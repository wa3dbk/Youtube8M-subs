00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 so well ka this story will be dedicated to 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.430
 what 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.640
 screen protectors for what they 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.640
 need and how their customer 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.349
 means 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.210
 by the resistive three 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.830
 crane 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.159
 they get pretty fast enough 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.319
 Well, that is, if in the mouth put phones with 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.650
 keys in your pocket 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.810
 then in a week it will be 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.480
 about 1 st Saratov 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.949
 and when you were all so 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.440
 your finger 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.230
 move on the screen then you notice 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.360
 that power starts to get stuck 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 deputy chairman 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.930
 what really 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.770
 very unpleasant 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.510
 here and over time, no wash 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.239
 and nothing good about it because 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.050
 it is good that it is exactly dear 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 so sarov is the most correct your 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.230
 phone protect special fund but in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.920
 In this case, as soon as 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.770
 work 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 so nicknamed as a result 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 re-pasted as settings card 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.050
 in the fourth film emissary what inexpensive 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.430
 and that's why they make up a resource 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.600
 defender 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 the last one is just because 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.430
 need to stick 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.500
 and here is a protective film which 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.530
 this contest is protected 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.550
 that's what 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.770
 blue marker and the one that 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.040
 with red marker 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.220
 accordingly, the layer that should 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.080
 directly adjacent to the screen it 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 is under 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.040
 red film that is if here so here 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 department this layer 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.549
 Too 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.549
 I will have to paste so 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 and usually make such a sequence 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.910
 sometimes of course there is a need for a film 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.000
 undercut 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 and if for example you 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620
 upon arrival like this 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 but if you lose the label of it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500
 it will be difficult to count 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830
 top protective film 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.220
 so I do it first 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.020
 selected 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.270
 the most important thing is that he is not 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 hit a bullet he all feel 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.279
 protected 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.369
 then and accordingly 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.509
 cutting out 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 but m 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.259
 magnitudes 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.259
 size 1 proceed stickers 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.519
 accordingly we must prepare 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.689
 the phone itself 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.339
 usually cocaine 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.709
 and factory tapes 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.199
 Well, something against this 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.869
 such a film on stand 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.369
 can someone during the week 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.799
 channel mup quite simply mechanically 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.049
 very weak 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.070
 little of 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.939
 but must pass in 2 weeks 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:44.749
 when in this completely 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.379
 test the phone puts 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.899
 normal protective 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.939
 because here are the vessels from entering pockets 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.399
 falling into the mud 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:52.819
 then alas 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.780
 click here on the screen 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.000
 what is the action of some water that dirt 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.799
 press the stages on the screen 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.549
 and to descendants remove you find that 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.429
 Well, you have people on the screen 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.190
 so walk in ratings 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.439
 can't 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.789
 it needs to be removed 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.509
 etc 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.759
 there is such that all Kislovodsk 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.779
 need a story about this phone before 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.739
 touch but it doesn't matter 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.409
 In principle, there remained the factory 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.540
 films with bubbles try them Odessa 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.249
 sure you will beat the problem by clicking on 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.469
 bubble 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.149
 barely touch the screen and maybe 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.419
 touch 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.059
 drag out any point of the lessons 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.059
 dishonored 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.999
 so 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.739
 started getting started 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.739
 I just change the film 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:42.669
 take st 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
 who was standing here 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.789
 I wipe all that dirt that can 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.809
 to accumulate 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.809
 the edges 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:56.509
 but for hoofed animals you will tell 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.349
 special napkins 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.339
 Those who 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.339
 do not leave 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.569
 can of course the surface 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.309
 offended beforehand 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.259
 however, it is not very important for us to 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.900
 there was not a single clinic 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.880
 on this living space from in special 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.180
 activity areas of some 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.199
 Cases this work people from Varna 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.960
 baths are quick in this raised steam 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 I really never intel 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.259
 so we proceed 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.259
 to samara film so paradise studio 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.309
 top protective layer 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:44.309
 here he left 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.949
 so he went 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.969
 all taken aside 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.999
 two layers left in the own grass 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.969
 uterine film and here that 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.270
 brainchild 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
 now cooper reds 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.639
 here, too, need a marginal 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.639
 neatness in the sense that for the first time 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.169
 in no case touched the inner 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.729
 surface guilherme 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.729
 on your phone 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.720
 and now 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.400
 actually speaking 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.819
 sticking 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.990
 there will be no second attempt therefore we 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.620
 should 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.689
 take aim 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.689
 perfect exactly 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.069
 But now he explained the passports 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.839
 so what can lead 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.580
 what can lead here 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.690
 that is the premises here is a speck of dust once 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.509
 here blades 2 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.529
 and here even the hair fell 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.469
 still he 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.469
 not only externally 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:53.210
 so you say 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.210
 to spoil 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.399
 air formed then 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.879
 there is 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.080
 if you separate try labels 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.270
 one more time or two will give a habit to pull out 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.279
 from there above the big place because 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.080
 it turned out it turned out 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.220
 in your place better then take one more 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.409
 one more film to be redone 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.759
 unusual air bubbles kick out 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.699
 sim cards 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.699
 in general, turned out to be traditions 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.069
 just because he 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.009
 and so here I am doing it now 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.659
 uncomfortable 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.490
 Well, that's what it looks like 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.979
 glued films 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.189
 that is, everything is good 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.189
 not plenary 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.310
 over time, it will of course be later 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.539
 mytnik 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.409
 from minor scratches if you will be here 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.879
 such is the phone uses remained 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.110
 cher 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.659
 year per person just me yet 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.089
 phone as I could 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.249
 to all
