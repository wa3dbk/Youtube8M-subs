like from up above when we place down

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
like from up above when we place down
the<00:00:24.810> Redstone<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> block<00:00:25.650> gets<00:00:25.890> pulled<00:00:26.130> down

out<00:00:28.320> again<00:00:28.439> before<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.920> even<00:00:29.220> though<00:00:29.340> it's

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
out again before we even though it's

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.589 
out again before we even though it's
happened<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.150> gives<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> player<00:00:30.570> just

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
happened and it gives the player just

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
happened and it gives the player just
enough<00:00:31.080> time<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.830> fall<00:00:32.009> down<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> secret

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
enough time to fall down into the secret

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
enough time to fall down into the secret
area<00:00:33.270> down<00:00:33.480> below<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> also<00:00:34.649> works<00:00:35.070> with

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
area down below now this also works with

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
area down below now this also works with
grass<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> dirt<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.180> well<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.750> give<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
grass and dirt as well if we give this a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
grass and dirt as well if we give this a
sneaky<00:00:37.800> little<00:00:37.920> hoe<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> also

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
sneaky little hoe you'll see it also

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.639 
sneaky little hoe you'll see it also
activates<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> door<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> cool<00:00:40.620> thing

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
activates the door but the cool thing

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
activates the door but the cool thing
here<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> turns<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> farmland<00:00:42.600> back

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
here is that it turns the farmland back

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
here is that it turns the farmland back
into<00:00:43.230> dirt<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.710> means<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
into dirt so it means we can use it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
into dirt so it means we can use it
again<00:00:44.700> straight<00:00:45.360> away<00:00:45.420> which<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.079> cool

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
again straight away which is pretty cool

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
again straight away which is pretty cool
so<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.800> door<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.190> activated<00:00:47.700> by

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so this door can be activated by

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
so this door can be activated by
redstone<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> also<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.440> activated<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
redstone but can also be activated by a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
redstone but can also be activated by a
hoe<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.289> wonderful

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
hoe as well so this wonderful

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
hoe as well so this wonderful

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
contraption it was not made by me it was

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.080 
contraption it was not made by me it was

his work right here now before I show

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
his work right here now before I show
you<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> build<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.020> am<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> try

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you how to build this I am going to try

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
you how to build this I am going to try
and<00:01:10.560> explain<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.580> works<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> might<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and explain how it works and I might get

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
and explain how it works and I might get
a<00:01:12.479> couple<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> details<00:01:13.200> wrong<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
a couple of details wrong because I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
a couple of details wrong because I
didn't<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:13.979> build<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.580> myself<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.210> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
didn't actually build this myself but I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.429 
didn't actually build this myself but I
do<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.720> understand<00:01:16.170> how<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> works<00:01:17.189> so

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
do think I understand how this works so

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.810 
do think I understand how this works so
this<00:01:19.439> piston<00:01:19.890> isn't<00:01:20.220> being<00:01:20.400> powered<00:01:20.700> by

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this piston isn't being powered by

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
this piston isn't being powered by
anything<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.840> provide<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.439> an

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
anything so when we provide it with an

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.100 
anything so when we provide it with an
update<00:01:22.950> from<00:01:23.159> above<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> retract

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
update from above it is going to retract

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.899 
update from above it is going to retract
which<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> cause<00:01:26.040> another<00:01:26.460> piston

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
which is going to cause another piston

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.730 
which is going to cause another piston
to<00:01:27.030> update<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to update this one right here now this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
to update this one right here now this
one<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.159> being<00:01:29.400> powered<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.090> block<00:01:30.329> over

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
one is being powered so that block over

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.060 
one is being powered so that block over
there<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> extend<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there is going to extend it's going to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
there is going to extend it's going to
push<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> redstone<00:01:33.060> block<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
push out the redstone block and then

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
push out the redstone block and then
that<00:01:34.439> causes<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> UM<00:01:35.490> power<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.090> then

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that causes this to UM power so then

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
that causes this to UM power so then
these<00:01:36.479> pistons<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.110> retract<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:38.250> one

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
these pistons here retract this one

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
these pistons here retract this one
becomes<00:01:38.880> unpowered<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> pull

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
becomes unpowered so it's going to pull

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
becomes unpowered so it's going to pull
the<00:01:40.439> redstone<00:01:40.860> block<00:01:41.100> back<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.390> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the redstone block back in and then it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
the redstone block back in and then it's
going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> power<00:01:42.990> itself<00:01:43.409> again<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
going to power itself again so when that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
going to power itself again so when that
block<00:01:44.939> gets<00:01:45.149> pushed<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> side<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
block gets pushed over to this side it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
block gets pushed over to this side it
goes<00:01:46.560> through<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.670> repeater<00:01:48.030> causing<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
goes through this repeater causing a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
goes through this repeater causing a
delay<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.110> means<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> piston<00:01:50.040> will

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
delay which means this piston will

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
delay which means this piston will
extend<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.540> block<00:01:51.810> retracts<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> when

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
extend when that block retracts and when

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
extend when that block retracts and when
it<00:01:52.890> retracts<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.430> powers<00:01:53.670> itself<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> tries

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it retracts it powers itself so it tries

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.959 
it retracts it powers itself so it tries
to<00:01:54.630> extend<00:01:55.140> again<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.189> piston<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.759> going

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to extend again and this piston is going

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.940 
to extend again and this piston is going
to<00:01:57.090> block<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.110> one<00:01:58.320> retracts<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to block it so when this one retracts is

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
to block it so when this one retracts is
going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> stay<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> state<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.840> at

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
going to stay in the state that it is at

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.719 
going to stay in the state that it is at
the<00:02:01.170> moment<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.680> also<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.549> that's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the moment and also when that's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.639 
the moment and also when that's
happening<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.659> signal<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> branch

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
happening the signal is going to branch

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.080 
happening the signal is going to branch
to<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.009> piston<00:02:05.430> over<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to this piston over here it's going to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
to this piston over here it's going to
move<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> detector<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.439> spot<00:02:07.740> which

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
move the detector out of this spot which

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.040 
move the detector out of this spot which
means<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.729> block<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.239> being<00:02:09.539> powered

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
means this block here is being powered

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320 
means this block here is being powered
so<00:02:10.649> when<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.459> described<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.970> second

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so when all of that I described a second

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.260 
so when all of that I described a second
ago<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.599> happening

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
ago is happening

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.360 
ago is happening
this<00:02:13.450> piston<00:02:13.870> gets<00:02:14.020> extended<00:02:14.440> again<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.160> gets

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
this piston gets extended again it gets

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.610 
this piston gets extended again it gets
pushed<00:02:15.670> over<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:17.440> it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
pushed over to here and that's when it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.410 
pushed over to here and that's when it
gets<00:02:17.710> powered<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> extended<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.150> and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
gets powered and extended like this and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.060 
gets powered and extended like this and
then<00:02:19.570> when<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> detector<00:02:20.320> rail<00:02:20.350> goes<00:02:20.680> back<00:02:20.890> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
then when the detector rail goes back to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.340 
then when the detector rail goes back to
this<00:02:21.250> block<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:22.240> one<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.630> no<00:02:22.780> longer<00:02:22.810> powered

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
this block this one is no longer powered

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.440 
this block this one is no longer powered
without<00:02:23.710> updating<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> piston<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.270> goes

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
without updating the piston so it goes

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.630 
without updating the piston so it goes
into<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> state<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.250> moment

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
into the state that it is at the moment

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.620 
into the state that it is at the moment
so<00:02:27.760> let's<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.510> action

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
so let's just see that in action

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.780 
so let's just see that in action
everything<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.350> describe<00:02:29.800> happens<00:02:30.580> in

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
everything I describe happens in

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.520 
everything I describe happens in
literary<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.810> or<00:02:31.930> two<00:02:32.080> seconds<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> build

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
literary one or two seconds so to build

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.050 
literary one or two seconds so to build
this<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.040> going<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.250> need<00:02:36.340> an<00:02:36.550> area<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
this you are going to need an area of

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.970 
this you are going to need an area of
land<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.540> five<00:02:37.840> blocks<00:02:38.140> wide<00:02:38.380> four

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
land that is five blocks wide four

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.620 
land that is five blocks wide four
blocks<00:02:39.220> deep<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> need<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.060> dig<00:02:40.240> down<00:02:40.420> by

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
blocks deep and you need to dig down by

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.600 
blocks deep and you need to dig down by
free<00:02:40.870> blocks<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.130> all<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.460> this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
free blocks like this now all of this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.280 
free blocks like this now all of this
surface<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.270> going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> be<00:02:43.690> filled<00:02:43.960> in<00:02:44.110> when

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
surface is going to be filled in when

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.630 
surface is going to be filled in when
you're<00:02:44.440> done<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.830> all<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.100> up<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.490> will

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
you're done so all of this up here will

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.730 
you're done so all of this up here will
be<00:02:45.670> whatever<00:02:46.420> material<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.320> want<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
be whatever material is you want and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.380 
be whatever material is you want and
then<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.130> block<00:02:48.400> at<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> front<00:02:48.970> will<00:02:49.120> be<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
then this block at the front will be the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.300 
then this block at the front will be the
one<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.170> activate<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:50.830> everything<00:02:51.190> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
one that you activate so everything is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.520 
one that you activate so everything is
going<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.640> fit<00:02:51.850> into<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.090> two<00:02:52.450> high<00:02:52.630> gap<00:02:52.870> down

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
going to fit into that two high gap down

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.140

block so we can place a piston here and

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.040 
block so we can place a piston here and
have<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.950> facing<00:03:39.190> downwards<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.990> you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
have it facing downwards like so so you

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.140 
have it facing downwards like so so you
can<00:03:41.320> patch<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.860> back<00:03:42.100> up<00:03:42.310> come<00:03:42.820> around<00:03:42.970> to

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
can patch that back up come around to

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.910 
can patch that back up come around to
this<00:03:43.270> side<00:03:43.330> over<00:03:43.840> here<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:44.050> want<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.500> place<00:03:44.709> a

out in these two positions and then put
a<00:03:51.070> sticky<00:03:51.520> piston<00:03:51.700> here<00:03:52.180> then<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.140> put<00:03:53.320> two

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
a sticky piston here then we can put two

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.190 
a sticky piston here then we can put two
blocks<00:03:53.709> on<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.520> side<00:03:54.730> ignore<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.240> one<00:03:55.450> but

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
blocks on this side ignore that one but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.590 
blocks on this side ignore that one but
a<00:03:56.230> sticky<00:03:56.709> piston<00:03:56.890> right<00:03:57.310> here<00:03:57.640> put<00:03:58.390> another

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
a sticky piston right here put another

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.780 
a sticky piston right here put another

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
of redstone in front of it and then our

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.590 
of redstone in front of it and then our
device<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.310> ready<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.700> go<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:03.880> let's<00:04:04.150> give<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
device is ready to go so let's give it a

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.630 
device is ready to go so let's give it a
test

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
test

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.309 
test
there<00:04:07.240> you<00:04:07.300> go<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.630> see<00:04:07.960> it<00:04:07.990> works

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
there you go you can see it works

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.840 
there you go you can see it works
perfectly<00:04:08.860> so<00:04:09.130> of<00:04:09.250> course<00:04:09.490> you're<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:09.790> to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
perfectly so of course you're going to

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.880 
perfectly so of course you're going to
want<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:10.120> couple<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.480> blocks<00:04:10.690> down<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.620> bottom

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
want a couple of blocks down the bottom

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.650 
want a couple of blocks down the bottom
there<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.310> when<00:04:12.819> you're<00:04:12.910> standing<00:04:13.270> on<00:04:13.330> top<00:04:13.540> of

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
there so when you're standing on top of

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.570 
there so when you're standing on top of
it<00:04:13.750> you're<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.140> drop<00:04:14.290> down<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> area

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
it you're going to drop down to the area

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.780 
it you're going to drop down to the area
down<00:04:15.760> below<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.950> all<00:04:18.130> there<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.670> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
down below so that is all there is to it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.550 
down below so that is all there is to it
it<00:04:18.880> doesn't<00:04:19.209> take<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.510> long<00:04:19.870> time<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.320> build

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
it doesn't take a long time to build

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.410 
it doesn't take a long time to build
which<00:04:20.859> isn't<00:04:21.190> surprising<00:04:21.489> considering<00:04:22.240> how
