00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hey i'm here again today with tom van 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 ask a guy and today we are going to ask a question 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.450
 answered that has to do with 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.429
 uncertainty 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.679
 me and tom also get the question very often 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.070
 how do you become less insecure 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 yes tank senate 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 you know the joke is this you want certain 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.140
 things might limp to the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 training need to appeal to young or how 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.750
 you will certainly be ours about yourself and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.920
 truth 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.439
 what can I do about it yes 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 actually there is only one real way 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 to deal with uncertainty and that is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.449
 by doing exactly what makes you scary 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 finds 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 yes and by overcoming those fears 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.360
 insist as it were that muscle becomes you 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.520
 stronger what you do your condition on 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 i can okay anyone i light 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 100 meters then 200 kilometers to outs 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.760
 yes, but what and things do you hear 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 for example in the past with you insecure 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 war I used to think it was very good 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.059
 so talk to groups at school 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 I actually avoided all things 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.239
 In order for the class to stand there when we were in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.920
 groups had to do the presentation 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.699
 I always make sure I wasn't there 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.289
 or dancing drinking but by 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 cynthia super not just coincidence and me 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.260
 I just didn't do that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.930
 just 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 and so actually I have years of it anyway 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 not done until at some point 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
 when I had been working on my site for years 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 the question got from sps if i got there 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.030
 wanted to give office and presentation 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 social media and about my site and my 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.509
 first response was really think of it too 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.000
 really super scary but yes I do not want that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.070
 but yes it can be just that cool 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.080
 people want to hear about me and then 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 I did it anyway and afterwards 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.619
 it felt so good about it was 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.090
 really good , of course we go with it 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 its afterwards things i all that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.509
 I want to do that but I like a lot 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 learned and now do it anyway 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.320
 two months I give one somewhere 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.060
 reading and you say yes part of my 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 company and I still like it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.659
 exciting but most of all I think now 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.030
 I am not very fun to do that anymore 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.500
 uncertain and afterwards when good 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.149
 gone when people say goh what do you have 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.259
 give a nice fellow 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.060
 yes, I feel there really super good 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.610
 the victory is also extra large 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.399
 part extra met if you really have it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.570
 a super good feeling well yes yes yes 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.729
 for example, is very clear 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.220
 the of cynthia how with the fear of being 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.510
 to go 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.160
 another example he something you 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
 you really have to look at it 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.729
 learn to do yes I found it very much 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 and to focus on things on my own 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 so go somewhere on my own too 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.310
 sit down and drink a cup of coffee 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 but also on my own for example 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.610
 go to that guy for my site 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.590
 yes i can't just be your boyfriend or you 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.970
 take mother so yes and I am gay 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.920
 of course not always with someone 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.540
 is when I walk through the city and I have 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 fancy a cup of coffee outside on it 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.780
 terrace yes then I really dare not 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.180
 do you think what should people not one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 so it makes them so friendless 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.930
 pathetic pathetic pathetic girl so I thought 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.400
 you know after a while just think go 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.720
 do especially to the events' to the thought 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.430
 yes I still want to 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.500
 it is part of my seite of mine 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.550
 work and I just started doing it and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.020
 the first time of course 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.800
 super and and a second and third time 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.300
 also 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.920
 but after a while you will touch it 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 used to it and you just know everyone 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.640
 very nice and that you are good 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.930
 people can stand up and if someone is there 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.550
 don't feel like talking to you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.780
 well perhaps not to know me 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.640
 then I will go somewhere else 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.740
 and perhaps to make up your cuffs 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.510
 also no matter no it does not matter so 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.670
 I don't like it anymore 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.600
 exciting but also because I do a lot now 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.530
 know people 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.790
 but you also get that if you go often 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.800
 the same things are always going again 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.209
 known and I learned that if you 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.590
 sit down on your own somewhere 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.550
 it in my restaurant in the evening 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.410
 food 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.540
 Well no one really looks at you not 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.010
 no one is concerned with you and if that if 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.630
 by the point only tough credit 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.370
 just budget do n't grow but yes 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.019
 so it really helps I am very sorry 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.640
 experience that it really helps a lot 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.900
 just to do things 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.910
 even though you find them scary and maybe going 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.320
 then it's best to miss Miss Marianne 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.630
 or think from the I really never do again 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.190
 but then the real challenge is 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.250
 do it right 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.720
 yes yes and he can now also from you 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.940
 are urban you what is something you 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.650
 exciting or scary find it very much like 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.200
 but still does not dare yes 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.690
 and the challenge for this week is remember 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.190
 just one thing and go do this week 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.810
 tells below and came weak 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.370
 do not land what you find exciting 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.650
 if you done it and tell how 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.090
 it was and how proud you are 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.430
 you just heard that fear overcame 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.950
 And that's the only way to be really short 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.810
 it with insecure you it 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.970
 mat can be quite small and you do not 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.799
 to Australia on your own 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.000
 you can really say something very small 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.989
 that I said on your own on the terrace 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.930
 drink a cup of coffee 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.010
 so start with something small and yes tell 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.650
 how that was 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.540
