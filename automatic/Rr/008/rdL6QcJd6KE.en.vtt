00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.980
 one of the most important moments of training 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 no, just be right your dog 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 teams and learn how to manage a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.880
 speak this command correctly and in time 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.580
 so that the dog can do it. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.269
 that's so important imagine 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 the dog 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 kind of computers when we load in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 computer some program we have 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.449
 passes three stages the first stage 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 you click the mouse on some program 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 the second stage she personally loaded the third 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 stage program is loaded and it can 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
 work the same in dog dog 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.880
 always when she wants to do something 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 it is for you to think about it measure it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.320
 I saw a cat she looked there head 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 they quickly swept right and chase it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 mining and the third stage 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.620
 she wore to do it already and started 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.170
 run as you think when and easier 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 stop just a dog, or the example of a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 computer when the easiest 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 switch computer then when you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 just bring the mouse to the program and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 think click or not click yes 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.079
 the program is loading and virality 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.390
 navit or when the program is loaded 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 also the dog itself is much reality 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 us a dog when he only wants 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.840
 do something or start doing up 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.970
 dog brains still perceive you and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.950
 can hear you but when the dog 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.390
 your already doctor but our case 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 programs on the computer from the game for 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.820
 booted or loaded then dogs 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 practice is not reality in appearance only 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 very trained dogs that are very 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 have a close host contoso and they and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.770
 strong motivation to work with a host 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 can go back 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 it needs a lot to do 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 an effort 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 so your task is not just to give 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 dog commands dog command but let's 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 at that moment when the dog can 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.479
 perceive for this you must observe 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.479
 for your dog and notice these moments 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.250
 you should see how brains work 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.439
 dogs lay out feel your dog 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.320
 on a walk, look for the dog 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
 attentive dog first comes to devils 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.360
 his thinking he is relaxed and here she is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.520
 wary of thinking and shrinkage 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 watch this if at this moment you 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.920
 you say command dog most likely u 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.479
 you will hear because she still think doing 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.599
 This is Lenin do she assesses the situation 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.550
 thought for how much she needs it well if 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.360
 are you talking at this moment the team yet 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.980
 can hear 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.780
 if the dog 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.970
 began to move where she decided to be 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 hard for dogs very soon fly off 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 up vs general stop all 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.390
 equal to stop a steam locomotive to the full 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.700
 speed though the principle of layout is 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.190
 what can we do in this 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.349
 the situation first will increase track 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.120
 so the dog can hear 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.549
 perfect when you clicked 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.519
 the dog the dog shifted attention with 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.560
 the moment she does on you and you 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.660
 say some command for this 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.239
 inclusion of we we do a few cops 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.129
 or it's your favorite team or or we click 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.349
 on a dog named or showed 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.200
 favorite toy or we can bullet 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.750
 the dog will throw her leash or collar 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.230
 or banks just a dog switched 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.810
 your thoughts on you till 1 mid 2 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.060
 you always learn your dog braking 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.609
 excitement ie during the game you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.420
 work out in her that she can quickly 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.129
 get aroused 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.170
 and quickly start doing something and then 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.690
 slow down dramatically for example started 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 play dog play ball baklah handle 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.959
 what do you do with something when 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.260
 for a moment say sit or lie down 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.669
 and dogs are laid down almost 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.099
 the dog is excited then sharply 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:25.069
 slowed down then toning it helps 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.079
 switch dogs faster and third 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.980
 the moment you do something that you are more interesting 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.169
 than anything else 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.599
 dogs to interest the dog's threads but she 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.730
 knows what's more interesting with you and you are up to her 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.639
 more meaningful and so she to you 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.859
 will turn go that is very important 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.750
 for you and makes three points first 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.540
 develop interest to you through the game 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 interesting communication second to train 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.120
 Stimulation of braking during the game in 3 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.310
 teach your dog to hear you everywhere for 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.470
 this must walk new places in 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.680
 city and what to learn new 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.959
 routes so that the dog learns to 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.970
 not only hear your commands but it 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.269
 the topic of a separate video then move on 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.269
 farther
