00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
work I had no clue how notes worked I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.330 
work I had no clue how notes worked I
had<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.720> single<00:01:45.750> idea<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.100> worked

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
had not a single idea on how they worked

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.539 
had not a single idea on how they worked
so<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> did<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.470> took<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.979> rune<00:01:50.159> items

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
so what I did was I took the rune items

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
so what I did was I took the rune items
and<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.720> pretty<00:01:52.229> much<00:01:52.320> thought<00:01:52.530> everything<00:01:52.740> was

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and I pretty much thought everything was

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
and I pretty much thought everything was
worthless<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.329> gonna<00:01:54.450> lie<00:01:54.509> about

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
worthless I'm not gonna lie about

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
worthless I'm not gonna lie about
everything<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.829> inventory<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
was noted I couldn't use I thought it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.539
