00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.680
Hello, i am Guido From Football Tricks Online

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.300
and i will teach you the following trick !

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.080
As you see, this trick it´s visually very attractive

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.916
Look very good when performed

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.760
It´s basically for street football

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.500
but if you fully dominate this, you can perform even in 11 a side

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.060
and clearly in Futsal

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.300
Step 1 is to flick the ball up with a special technique

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.880
which is the following

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.360
as you see...

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.785
in the example

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:55.645
we did this...

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880
that will be the first step

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.260
we have a step by step tutorial on how to perform this flick

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.080
really detailed tutorial, so i will leave you it on screen

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.900
you can click on it or find the link in the video description

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.020
but dont worry, i will still teach it in a basic way now

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.360
But if you want all the details and tips, go watch the tutorial

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.811
So lets start

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.320
with you NON-Dominant foot

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.380
go over the ball and place it next to it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.280
like this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.780
With you Dominant foot, simply pressure the ball

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.302
versus your NON-Dominant

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.420
With the outside part of you Dominant

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.020
like this...

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.400
we need to have good grip of the ball

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.540
both feet and the ball have to make a horizontal line

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260
dont leave your foot a bit back or a bit forward

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.820
basically make a horizontal line

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.580
If you want to learn this step very good, as i said before...

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.420
go watch the tutorial in description and it will explain step by step with tips

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.840
to finish step one, simply flick the ball up

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.780
rolling it versus your NON-Dominant leg

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.940
like that...

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
step 1 all together...

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.920
step 2 is very basic

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.640
once the ball is in the air just hit it with you NON-Dominant

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940
for the ball to go over your opponent

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.300
like this...

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.580
For the ball to go over the opponent correctly and effectively

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.760
keep in mind the following

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
if i perform the trick facing the opponent

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220
As in a real game situation

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.660
what will happen is...

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.160
when we perform the trick and flick the ball up

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.854
the ball will be to your side

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.400
and as you hit it it will go in the wrong direction!!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.560
so we dont want that, we want the ball to go over the opponent

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.340
So to do this trick correctly

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.280
try to end in a sideway position

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.520
So when performed, ball will go over the opponent

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.240
So when facing opponent try to end in a sideway position

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.199
to the flick up

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.466
and hit it with your toes

00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.826
and correctly make the ball go over him

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.160
like this...

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.605
face him and go sideways a bit

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.160
then perform

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.380
over him

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000
this trick is better done with no movement

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.420
but if you practice a lot you can also do it at medium speed

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.860
as shown in the example

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.420
speed can be managed

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.420
you need practice to find the perfect speed

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.220
where you feel more confortable performing the trick effectively

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.540
practice fast and if you fail a lot lower the speed

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.160
to find the perfect speed

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.380
keep in mind we hit the ball with the NON-Dominant foot

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.520
so yeah, its you "NON-Dominant"

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.020
which you dont control as good as your Dominant

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.720
so as you hit the ball, sometimes it might not go straight over the opponent

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.680
because you dont have much practice on kicking with NON-Dominant

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.900
so you wont have maximum control at first to go cleanly over the opponent

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.440
but with some practice you will get better at it

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.400
Last point and important!

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.860
as you hit it, watch your power too

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.760
try to use a power where the ball goes over fast and not high

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.260
because if it goes too high

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.500
the ball will take longer to come down

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.220
and opponent will have time for receiving or covering you

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.320
so make it a quick hit and not so high to then sprint

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.000
