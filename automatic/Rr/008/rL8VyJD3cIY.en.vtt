the rubber grips on the bottom of your

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.410 
the rubber grips on the bottom of your
laptop<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.130> said<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.790> very<00:02:41.120> very

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
laptop like I said it's a very very

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.509 
laptop like I said it's a very very
light<00:02:41.690> super<00:02:42.680> slim<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.190> could<00:02:43.340> definitely

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
light super slim you could definitely

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.309 
light super slim you could definitely
fit<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.060> into<00:02:44.360> your<00:02:44.510> backpack<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:48.140> got

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
fit this into your backpack it's got

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.789 
fit this into your backpack it's got
these<00:02:49.420> legs<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.319> got<00:02:51.590> rubber

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
these legs here and it's it's got rubber

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.680 
these legs here and it's it's got rubber
on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.100> bottom<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.610> should<00:02:52.970> prevent<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
on the bottom so that should prevent the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.130 
on the bottom so that should prevent the
slipping<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:56.150> got<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.330> pretty<00:02:56.600> good<00:02:56.750> grip<00:02:56.959> on

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
slipping it's got a pretty good grip on

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.059 
slipping it's got a pretty good grip on
it<00:02:57.200> and<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:01.489> looks<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.060> USB<00:03:02.780> thing<00:03:03.769> can

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
it and it looks like this USB thing can

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.220 
it and it looks like this USB thing can
be<00:03:04.250> placed<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.180> either<00:03:05.510> side<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.080> could

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
be placed in either side you could

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.830 
be placed in either side you could
either<00:03:06.319> do<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.799> here<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.459> guess<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.330> would<00:03:08.480> wrap

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
either do it here I guess you would wrap

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.830 
either do it here I guess you would wrap
it<00:03:09.049> around<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:10.810> right<00:03:11.810> here<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:16.840> tuck

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it around this right here and then tuck

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.880 
it around this right here and then tuck
it<00:03:17.989> into<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.970> something<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.450> or<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
it into that something like that or you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.440 
it into that something like that or you
could<00:03:24.100> take<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:25.700> groove<00:03:26.209> right

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
could take it out of this groove right

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.660 
could take it out of this groove right
here<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.019> just<00:03:27.470> do<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.980> same<00:03:28.160> thing<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.519> this

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
here and just do the same thing on this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.319 
here and just do the same thing on this
side<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.060> tuck<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.390> in<00:03:29.510> right<00:03:29.720> there<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:31.329> that

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
side and tuck it in right there so that

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.710 
side and tuck it in right there so that
is<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:33.200> nice<00:03:33.950> little<00:03:34.250> touch<00:03:34.700> I'm<00:03:35.359> gonna<00:03:35.540> put

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
is a nice little touch I'm gonna put

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.890 
is a nice little touch I'm gonna put
these<00:03:35.900> things<00:03:36.170> down<00:03:36.700> let's<00:03:37.700> see<00:03:37.910> how<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.239> fan

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.370 

works<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:43.640> what<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.090> will<00:03:44.150> do<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:47.230> plug<00:03:48.230> it

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
works so what I will do is I plug it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.210 
works so what I will do is I plug it
into<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:50.170> USB<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.620> my<00:03:51.920> other<00:03:52.190> laptop<00:03:52.880> here

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
into the USB of my other laptop here

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.740 
into the USB of my other laptop here
which<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.400> also<00:03:55.579> using<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.269> other

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
which is also using the other

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.620 
which is also using the other
coolermaster<00:03:57.739> thing<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.220> bought

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.510 

the<00:04:03.630> fan<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.080> somewhat<00:04:04.470> silent<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.160> yet<00:04:05.370> it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
the fan is somewhat silent but yet it

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.490 
the fan is somewhat silent but yet it
does<00:04:05.730> sound<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.270> fan<00:04:06.600> it's<00:04:06.870> not<00:04:07.050> as<00:04:07.200> quiet

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
does sound like a fan it's not as quiet

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.320 
does sound like a fan it's not as quiet
as<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.920> other<00:04:08.100> ones<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.550> I've<00:04:08.670> seen<00:04:08.700> but

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
as the other ones that I've seen but

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.990 
as the other ones that I've seen but
it's<00:04:10.050> not<00:04:10.260> loud<00:04:10.500> either<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.550> not<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> big

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
it's not loud either so it's not a big

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.479 
it's not loud either so it's not a big
deal<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:15.320> don't<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.470> how<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.920> would<00:04:17.040> be<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.459> a

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
deal I don't know how it would be on a

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.060 
deal I don't know how it would be on a
bed<00:04:17.850> because<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.900> looks<00:04:19.080> like<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.680> part<00:04:19.920> where

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
bed because it looks like the part where

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.330 
bed because it looks like the part where
it<00:04:20.160> sucks<00:04:20.459> up<00:04:20.670> air<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.420> gonna<00:04:21.510> be

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
it sucks up air is just gonna be

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080 
it sucks up air is just gonna be
directly<00:04:23.340> covered<00:04:24.270> by<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.510> fan<00:04:25.850> or<00:04:26.850> by<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
directly covered by the fan or by the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.810 
directly covered by the fan or by the
surface<00:04:27.540> of<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.780> bed<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:28.230> air<00:04:29.010> still<00:04:29.460> does

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
surface of the bed but air still does

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.870 
surface of the bed but air still does
blow<00:04:30.180> out<00:04:30.480> I'm<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:31.440> sure<00:04:31.710> where<00:04:31.920> it's<00:04:32.100> it's

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
blow out I'm not sure where it's it's

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.340 
blow out I'm not sure where it's it's
probably<00:04:33.180> sucking<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.630> air<00:04:33.840> up<00:04:33.990> from<00:04:34.200> these

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
probably sucking that air up from these

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.510 
probably sucking that air up from these
sides<00:04:34.680> right<00:04:35.070> here<00:04:36.440> but<00:04:37.440> there's<00:04:37.890> a<00:04:38.010> lot<00:04:38.370> of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
sides right here but there's a lot of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160 
sides right here but there's a lot of
airflow<00:04:38.700> like<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.390> other<00:04:39.510> ones<00:04:39.750> are<00:04:39.900> kind<00:04:39.930> of

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
airflow like the other ones are kind of

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.830 
airflow like the other ones are kind of
hard<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> notice<00:04:41.040> but<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.430> one<00:04:41.640> is<00:04:41.840> pretty

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
hard to notice but this one is pretty

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.860 
hard to notice but this one is pretty
obvious<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:44.000> let's<00:04:45.000> see<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.360> am<00:04:45.630> going<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.720> I

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
obvious so let's see I am going to and I

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.510 
obvious so let's see I am going to and I
just<00:04:49.080> unplugged<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.010> can<00:04:50.160> see<00:04:50.340> how

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
just unplugged it you can see how

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.610 
just unplugged it you can see how
smoothly<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.330> fan<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:52.080> flows<00:04:52.350> there's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
smoothly the fan actually flows there's

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.150 
smoothly the fan actually flows there's
like<00:04:52.830> really<00:04:53.430> no<00:04:53.580> friction<00:04:54.120> at<00:04:54.210> all<00:04:54.860> it's<00:04:55.860> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
like really no friction at all it's a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.890 
like really no friction at all it's a
very<00:04:56.640> smooth<00:04:57.060> flowing<00:04:57.890> fan<00:04:58.890> so<00:04:59.310> let's<00:04:59.550> see

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
very smooth flowing fan so let's see

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.540 
very smooth flowing fan so let's see
here<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.110> with<00:05:01.350> my<00:05:01.500> laptop<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:04.550> I'll

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
here it is with my laptop on it and I'll

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.610 
here it is with my laptop on it and I'll
plug<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.960> that's<00:05:09.960> how<00:05:10.140> it<00:05:10.320> fits

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
plug this in and that's how it fits

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.150 
plug this in and that's how it fits
right<00:05:10.890> there<00:05:10.950> this<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:12.620> 13-inch<00:05:13.620> MacBook

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
right there this is the 13-inch MacBook

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.140 
right there this is the 13-inch MacBook
Pro<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:19.320> guess<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.550> wanted<00:05:20.940> more

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
Pro and I guess if you wanted more

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.730 
Pro and I guess if you wanted more
airflow<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.930> would<00:05:22.050> just<00:05:22.200> have<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.410> kick

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
airflow you would just have to kick

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:33.110 
airflow you would just have to kick
these<00:05:22.950> legs<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.930> like<00:05:24.930> so

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.850
