00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
along the acrylic edge right here the

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.380 
along the acrylic edge right here the
shuttle<00:00:47.320> itself<00:00:47.499> is<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.070> rotary<00:00:48.640> shuttle<00:00:49.179> it

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
shuttle itself is a rotary shuttle it

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.869 
shuttle itself is a rotary shuttle it
slides<00:00:49.809> right<00:00:50.109> off<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.469> bottom<00:00:50.859> and<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.850> can

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
slides right off the bottom and you can

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.910 
slides right off the bottom and you can
see<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.539> it's<00:00:52.690> got<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.899> rotary<00:00:53.350> blade<00:00:53.679> right

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
see that it's got a rotary blade right

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.279 
see that it's got a rotary blade right
there<00:00:54.219> that's<00:00:54.819> what<00:00:55.210> makes<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.569> cut<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
there that's what makes it cut the

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.069 
there that's what makes it cut the
shuttle<00:00:56.979> slides<00:00:57.309> right<00:00:57.760> on<00:00:57.819> to<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.479> end<00:00:58.659> of

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
shuttle slides right on to the end of

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.619 
shuttle slides right on to the end of
the<00:00:59.589> cutter<00:00:59.800> pede<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.760> simply<00:01:01.179> slide<00:01:01.449> it

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
the cutter pede you simply slide it

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.799 
the cutter pede you simply slide it
right<00:01:01.659> on<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.409> off<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.969> self-healing<00:01:04.479> mat

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
right on and off the self-healing mat

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.700 
right on and off the self-healing mat
will<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.979> change<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:07.270> can<00:01:07.570> change<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.229> out<00:01:08.380> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
will it change you can change it out and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.649 
will it change you can change it out and
get<00:01:08.950> four<00:01:09.250> uses<00:01:09.729> from<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.450> see<00:01:10.630> that

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
get four uses from it you can see that

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.819 
get four uses from it you can see that
I've<00:01:10.869> used<00:01:11.200> one<00:01:11.590> here<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.280> can<00:01:12.790> turn<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.899> get

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
I've used one here I can turn it and get

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.340 
I've used one here I can turn it and get
another<00:01:15.280> use<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.939> can<00:01:16.270> flip<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.600> over<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.200> get

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
another use I can flip it over and get

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.399 
another use I can flip it over and get
two<00:01:17.649> more<00:01:17.680> uses<00:01:18.369> for<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:18.759> mat<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:20.140> little

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
two more uses for that mat so a little

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.139 
two more uses for that mat so a little
bit<00:01:20.649> goes<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> long<00:01:21.100> way<00:01:21.460> if<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.759> think<00:01:21.789> your

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
bit goes a long way if you think your

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.910 
bit goes a long way if you think your
blade<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.539> getting<00:01:22.869> dull<00:01:23.079> you<00:01:23.320> probably<00:01:23.770> just

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
blade is getting dull you probably just

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.639 
blade is getting dull you probably just
need<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.219> change<00:01:24.430> out<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.880> mat<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.899> let<00:01:26.530> me

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
need to change out the mat so let me

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.310 
need to change out the mat so let me
show<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:26.890> how<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.490> cuts<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:28.869> slide<00:01:29.110> that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
show you how this cuts will slide that

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.090 
show you how this cuts will slide that
ruler<00:01:29.649> out<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.329> take<00:01:31.539> your<00:01:31.689> paper<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.320> slide

ruler out you take your paper and slide
it<00:01:33.280> into<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.670> cutter<00:01:33.969> pede<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:35.039> measure

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
it into the cutter pede and measure

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.340 
it into the cutter pede and measure
along<00:01:36.670> your<00:01:36.880> ruler<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.390> if<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.570> want<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.899> two-inch

along your ruler so if I want a two-inch
cut<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.950> simply<00:01:39.640> cut<00:01:39.850> right<00:01:40.060> along<00:01:40.180> here<00:01:40.630> if<00:01:40.840> I

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
cut I simply cut right along here if I

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.889 
cut I simply cut right along here if I
want<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.350> 7-inch<00:01:41.920> cut<00:01:42.219> I<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:43.060> line<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.359> up<00:01:43.630> on

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
want a 7-inch cut I just line it up on

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.590 
want a 7-inch cut I just line it up on
the<00:01:44.200> ruler<00:01:44.500> itself<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.219> then<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.149> want<00:01:46.479> to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the ruler itself and then I want to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.599 
the ruler itself and then I want to
start<00:01:46.869> at<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.109> bottom<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.740> move<00:01:48.039> towards<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
start at the bottom and move towards the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.789 
start at the bottom and move towards the
top<00:01:48.850> with<00:01:49.119> my<00:01:49.270> paper<00:01:49.570> lined<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:50.170> along<00:01:50.530> that

blades all I have to do is slide one

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.709 
blades all I have to do is slide one
down<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.200> pick<00:01:59.950> out<00:02:00.100> my<00:02:00.249> next<00:02:00.609> one<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.060> slide

it right on this happens to be a scoring

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.749 
it right on this happens to be a scoring
blade<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.409> want<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.740> make<00:02:05.920> cards<00:02:06.280> and

things I simply can score and then fold

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.600 
things I simply can score and then fold
and<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.629> makes<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.959> nice<00:02:14.200> solid<00:02:14.980> crease<00:02:15.310> right

there<00:02:15.819> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> paper

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
there on the paper

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.220 
there on the paper
I can<00:02:17.430> change<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.000> out<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:19.020> make<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
I can change this out and I can make a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.430 
I can change this out and I can make a
perforating<00:02:20.070> cut<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.150> instead<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.630> scoring<00:02:22.080> or

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
perforating cut so instead of scoring or

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.320 
perforating cut so instead of scoring or
cutting<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.250> perforate<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.060> want<00:02:24.270> to
