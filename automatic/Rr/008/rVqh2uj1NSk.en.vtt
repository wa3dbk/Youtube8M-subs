global<00:00:26.250> warming<00:00:26.390> trees<00:00:27.390> are<00:00:27.420> really

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
global warming trees are really

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
global warming trees are really
important<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.320> air<00:00:28.650> quality<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.760> only<00:00:29.910> are

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
important for air quality not only are

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
important for air quality not only are
they<00:00:30.210> filtering<00:00:30.689> co2<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> air<00:00:31.619> but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
they filtering co2 out of the air but

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
they filtering co2 out of the air but
they're<00:00:32.160> producing<00:00:32.579> oxygen<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.410> we<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.530> know

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
they're producing oxygen and we all know

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
they're producing oxygen and we all know
that<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.160> oxygen<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.760> live<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.300> more

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that we need oxygen to live the more

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
that we need oxygen to live the more
trees<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.050> plant<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.710> more<00:00:38.010> carbon<00:00:38.700> we

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
trees that we plant the more carbon we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.660 
trees that we plant the more carbon we
lock<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.840> important<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:41.430> grow

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
lock up that's important here they grow

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
lock up that's important here they grow
dozens<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> different<00:00:42.510> kinds<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.989> trees<00:00:43.260> well

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
dozens of different kinds of trees well

dozens of different kinds of trees well
we<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> few<00:00:44.700> different<00:00:44.730> trees<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> are

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
we have a few different trees that are

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
we have a few different trees that are
available<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> grow<00:00:46.680> organically<00:00:47.250> will

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
available that we grow organically will

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.510 
available that we grow organically will
be<00:00:47.730> available<00:00:48.180> soon<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.660> organic<00:00:48.989> style

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
States provides very nice fall color

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.170 
States provides very nice fall color
this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> Luna<00:00:58.020> tree<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.980> also<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.340> giant

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
this is the Luna tree we also have giant

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
this is the Luna tree we also have giant
sequoias<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.770> only<00:01:02.190> people

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
sequoias pretty much we're only people

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
sequoias pretty much we're only people
growing<00:01:02.789> organic<00:01:03.329> redwoods<00:01:03.719> right<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.080> we

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
growing organic redwoods right now we

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
growing organic redwoods right now we
really<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> story<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.760> Johnston

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really like the story about Johnston

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
really like the story about Johnston
nurseries<00:01:06.810> Johnston<00:01:07.409> nursery<00:01:07.710> does

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
nurseries Johnston nursery does

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
nurseries Johnston nursery does
everything<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.580> that's<00:01:09.119> sustainable<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.320> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
everything in that's sustainable so it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
everything in that's sustainable so it's
sustainable<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.130> production<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.180> trees

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
sustainable on production of these trees

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
sustainable on production of these trees
so<00:01:13.020> they're<00:01:13.530> doing<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.130> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so they're doing it in a way that

so they're doing it in a way that
doesn't<00:01:14.490> harm<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> environment<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.509> any<00:01:15.659> way

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
doesn't harm the environment in any way

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.890 
doesn't harm the environment in any way
that<00:01:16.200> means<00:01:16.350> using<00:01:16.590> soil<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:18.030> basically

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that means using soil that has basically

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
that means using soil that has basically
Earth<00:01:19.110> based<00:01:19.380> products<00:01:20.220> nothing<00:01:20.640> from

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Earth based products nothing from
