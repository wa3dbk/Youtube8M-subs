00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.620 

so<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:10.040> know<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.220> thought<00:03:10.490> uh<00:03:10.520> come<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.240> here<00:03:11.480> do

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
so you know I thought uh come on here do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.900 
so you know I thought uh come on here do
a<00:03:11.660> quick<00:03:11.840> video<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.800> weird<00:03:13.070> thing<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:13.670> is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
a quick video one weird thing is this is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.590 
a quick video one weird thing is this is
like<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.290> volume<00:03:15.290> volume<00:03:15.830> tone<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.790> must<00:03:17.210> think

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
like a volume volume tone I must think

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.160 
like a volume volume tone I must think
it<00:03:17.750> should<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.930> volume<00:03:18.470> tone<00:03:18.800> tone<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:20.180> that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
it should be volume tone tone but that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.780 
it should be volume tone tone but that
way<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.320> can<00:03:21.590> control<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.130> volume<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.610> both

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
way you can control the volume of both

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:46.960 
way you can control the volume of both

I've seen out there four different ways

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.200 
I've seen out there four different ways
to<00:07:22.030> play<00:07:22.150> the<00:07:22.360> intro<00:07:22.540> and<00:07:22.990> I<00:07:23.950> I<00:07:24.340> play<00:07:24.970> it<00:07:27.210> with

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
to play the intro and I I play it with

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.310 
to play the intro and I I play it with
ending<00:07:28.600> with<00:07:28.750> the<00:07:28.870> G<00:07:30.780> but<00:07:31.780> there's<00:07:32.020> a<00:07:32.110> whole

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
ending with the G but there's a whole

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.070 
ending with the G but there's a whole
bunch<00:07:32.350> of<00:07:32.710> other<00:07:33.060> versions<00:07:34.060> out<00:07:34.420> there<00:07:34.450> but<00:07:34.870> I

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
think that's the most accurate one but

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.700 
think that's the most accurate one but
that's<00:07:37.300> a<00:07:37.480> video<00:07:37.630> for<00:07:37.810> another<00:07:38.020> time
