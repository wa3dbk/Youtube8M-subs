added to this one theory being bigger
bigger<00:02:20.270> foot<00:02:20.600> goes<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> bigger<00:02:21.440> person<00:02:22.010> need

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
bigger foot goes to a bigger person need

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.790 
bigger foot goes to a bigger person need
a<00:02:22.610> little<00:02:22.760> stiffer<00:02:23.209> base<00:02:23.420> plates<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.620> have

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
a little stiffer base plates so you have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.010 
a little stiffer base plates so you have
a<00:02:24.830> consistent<00:02:25.489> flex<00:02:25.819> from<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.450> medium/large

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
a consistent flex from you medium/large

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.360 
a consistent flex from you medium/large
to<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:28.130> large<00:02:28.430> extra-large<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.500> tip<00:02:30.770> we

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
to your large extra-large on that tip we

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.610 
to your large extra-large on that tip we
do<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.760> same<00:02:32.120> thing<00:02:32.150> here<00:02:32.989> with<00:02:33.380> our

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
do that same thing here with our

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.100 
do that same thing here with our
dampening<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.580> we<00:02:34.819> use<00:02:35.060> toe<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.750> heel

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
dampening so we use toe and heel

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.860 
dampening so we use toe and heel
dampening<00:02:36.590> there's<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.310> 55<00:02:37.940> durometer<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
dampening there's a 55 durometer on the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.800 
dampening there's a 55 durometer on the
medium<00:02:39.170> large<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.650> there<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.550> 65<00:02:41.330> durometer

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810

on<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.590> large<00:02:42.800> extra-large<00:02:43.480> much<00:02:44.480> like

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
on your large extra-large much like

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.229 
on your large extra-large much like
skateboard<00:02:45.500> bushings<00:02:46.010> stiffer<00:02:46.819> durometer

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239

for<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.709> larger<00:02:49.280> bigger<00:02:49.610> person<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:51.200> only

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
for the larger bigger person the only

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.620 
for the larger bigger person the only
thing<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.680> touches<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:54.100> board<00:02:55.480> with<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
thing that touches the board with the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.559 
thing that touches the board with the
force<00:02:56.840> base<00:02:57.049> play<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:59.890> your<00:03:00.890> disc<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.569> your

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
force base play is your disc and your

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.229 
force base play is your disc and your
ring<00:03:02.780> everything<00:03:03.739> else<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.310> sitting<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.730> EV<00:03:05.209> a

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
ring everything else is sitting on EV a

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.440 
ring everything else is sitting on EV a
so<00:03:05.390> underneath<00:03:06.170> your<00:03:06.500> heel<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.070> your<00:03:07.880> toe<00:03:08.120> is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
so underneath your heel and your toe is

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.930 
so underneath your heel and your toe is
sitting<00:03:09.079> EBA<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> only<00:03:10.549> thing<00:03:10.640> that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
sitting EBA so the only thing that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.610 
sitting EBA so the only thing that
actually<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.540> resting<00:03:12.019> on<00:03:12.170> your<00:03:12.200> board<00:03:12.530> is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
actually is resting on your board is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.370 
actually is resting on your board is
this<00:03:12.799> ring<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.579> disc<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.150> what<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.079> is

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
this ring in this disc and what that is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.130 
this ring in this disc and what that is
basically<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.480> allows<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.780> board<00:03:17.989> to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
basically is allows the board to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.740 
basically is allows the board to
torsionally<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.190> laterally<00:03:19.579> flex<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.570> way

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
torsionally and laterally flex the way

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.990 
torsionally and laterally flex the way
it's<00:03:20.900> designed<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.470> know<00:03:22.040> one<00:03:22.160> designs<00:03:22.489> boards

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
it's designed to know one designs boards

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.130 
it's designed to know one designs boards
have<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> big<00:03:24.200> brick<00:03:24.620> on<00:03:24.859> there<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.140> have

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
have a big brick on there and then have

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.140 
have a big brick on there and then have
it<00:03:27.170> have<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.709> flex<00:03:28.100> normally<00:03:28.549> it's<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:28.910> it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
it have it flex normally it's just it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.020 
it have it flex normally it's just it
just<00:03:29.390> doesn't<00:03:29.720> work<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.070> when<00:03:31.430> we

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
just doesn't work like that so when we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.620 
just doesn't work like that so when we
raise<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.959> or<00:03:33.700> put<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.880> EV<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> under

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
raise this up or put the EV a under

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.569 
raise this up or put the EV a under
there<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.900> allows<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> nice<00:03:36.769> consistent

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
there it allows for a nice consistent

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.069 
there it allows for a nice consistent
flexing<00:03:38.090> their<00:03:38.180> Nathan<00:03:38.540> allows<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.870> board<00:03:39.019> to

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
flexing their Nathan allows the board to

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.080 
flexing their Nathan allows the board to
do<00:03:39.260> what<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.530> supposed<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.799> do<00:03:39.980> also<00:03:40.850> what<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
do what it's supposed to do also what it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.180 
do what it's supposed to do also what it
does<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.450> pulls<00:03:41.750> away<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.140> hinge<00:03:42.440> point<00:03:42.799> so

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
does is it pulls away the hinge point so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.020 
does is it pulls away the hinge point so
when<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.329> have<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.840> hard<00:03:45.380> piece<00:03:46.030> against

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
when you have this hard piece against

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.000 
when you have this hard piece against
board<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.630> roll<00:03:47.840> over<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.170> bars<00:03:48.380> or<00:03:48.680> land<00:03:48.920> in

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
board you roll over the bars or land in

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.890 
board you roll over the bars or land in
the<00:03:49.100> back<00:03:49.310> seat<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:53.030> acts<00:03:53.359> like

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
the back seat that that a that acts like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.470 
the back seat that that a that acts like
a<00:03:54.230> hinge<00:03:54.650> there<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.160> it'll<00:03:55.700> snap<00:03:56.000> your<00:03:56.239> board

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
a hinge there and it'll snap your board

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.539 
a hinge there and it'll snap your board
so<00:03:56.989> when<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.230> pull<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.530> away<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.310> put

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
so when you pull that away and you put

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.360 
so when you pull that away and you put
EBA<00:03:58.910> there<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.540> gives<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.930> some<00:04:00.230> movement<00:04:01.220> or

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
EBA there it gives it some movement or

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.000 
EBA there it gives it some movement or
it<00:04:01.609> allows<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.299> flex<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.380> way<00:04:03.500> it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
it allows it to flex the way it

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.160 
it allows it to flex the way it
good<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.400> come<00:04:04.700> back<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:04.970> way<00:04:05.330> it's<00:04:06.049> supposed

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
good and come back the way it's supposed

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.259 
good and come back the way it's supposed
to<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:08.739> four<00:04:09.739> by<00:04:09.829> four<00:04:10.040> discs<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.459> then<00:04:11.180> you

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
to use four by four discs and then you

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.880 
to use four by four discs and then you
set<00:04:11.480> these<00:04:11.629> up<00:04:11.689> you<00:04:12.019> want<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.290> set<00:04:12.439> them<00:04:12.560> up<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
set these up you want to set them up a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.309 
set these up you want to set them up a
long<00:04:13.129> way<00:04:13.569> placing<00:04:14.569> your<00:04:14.689> board<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:15.079> this

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
long way placing your board like this

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.610 
long way placing your board like this
and<00:04:15.769> now<00:04:15.920> boy<00:04:16.100> with<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> four<00:04:16.639> by<00:04:16.790> two<00:04:17.620> bolt
