00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 this video is going to be very short and it's 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.170
 because I just want them to understand something 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.179
 very punctual, stop for a moment 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 concentration the following do not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.519
 it will take a lot of time to understand how 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.690
 the leagues work the divisions 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 sanz with a league represents 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 theoretically the level of each player and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 every divisions are your steps good 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 if you know that then look at that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
 comparison let's say that you're 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 studying and whatever it is that is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 studying fear in total five periods 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.870
 each period needs to be exceeded for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 be in the next period one is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.950
 the one of the newcomers and the five is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 that of those who have gone through everything and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.739
 they know much more now think about that every 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.020
 period has 100 students and by 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.469
 course you have 100 positions to be 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.539
 locate among those 100 fight over 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.820
 be in the first place but what is not 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.100
 you know is that the best student and the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 worst student will continue to think about the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.449
 same period and the only thing that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.140
 They are different but they are 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.060
 theoretically they have the same level 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.130
 exactly that happens with the leagues and the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.259
 divisions of order forget the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.689
 divisions that you are silver 1 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.689
 5 silver understand that is exactly what 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.490
 same are silver they are or I do not mean 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.770
 that a silver 1 was the same as a silver 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 without many they will tell me that in silver 5 is what 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.720
 same fibrous and they may have 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.549
 reason but what I want to buy is 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.220
 that if you eliminate that barrier 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.829
 mental that the internal classification 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.079
 between the leagues then they can upload 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.880
 more easily 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.580
 I go to many who write to me very 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.189
 worried or angry because they are in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.990
 gold 1 and gold dropped 2 and they fear 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.390
 keep playing and that's why they 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.360
 I explain this it does not matter if it's a platinum 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.789
 1 platinum 2 3 4 5 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 if you understand that they are platinum only 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.130
 then you can play without worrying 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.319
 go down to raise divisions the important thing 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.959
 really is that you play like 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.600
 diamonds being platinum and so will go up 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.060
 eventually 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.039
 the game is made to have fun and if 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.500
 they manage to do it and they also remove that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.390
 pressure that you yourselves have on 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.239
 the divisions is a matter of time 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.890
 just in fact remember that the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.920
 promotions between divisions and leagues 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.870
 they are in this way so they adapt 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.150
 a little bit to what are the endings of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.160
 tournaments and learn to hold the pressure 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 what this generates 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.420
 I do not want to read any player saying 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.940
 is that one is not as bad as a 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.370
 bronze or is that I can not climb because 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 I hit trolls to efe every disconnected 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 Mancos are uglier remember that if 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 you are bronze but you manage to see the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.860
 challengers and you find the differences or 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.290
 if you simply delete all your 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.930
 errors raised over time never 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.780
 you think it 's good because if you go 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.590
 you will have nothing to improve greetings 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.590
 many successes
