ordinary<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> something<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.100> think

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
ordinary it's not something that I think

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
ordinary it's not something that I think
a<00:01:11.400> lot<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.580> people<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:12.060> try<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.869> based

a lot of people would try out just based

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
a lot of people would try out just based

ranger<00:01:39.810> play<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
ranger play is your kind of just the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.920

fucking pain in the ass for the other

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
fucking pain in the ass for the other
team<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.909> think

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
team not because you're I don't think

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.210 
team not because you're I don't think
your<00:01:45.270> goal<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> big<00:01:46.320> damage<00:01:46.829> dealer

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
your goal is to be a big damage dealer

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
your goal is to be a big damage dealer
and<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.579> burst<00:01:47.970> killer<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.810> downer<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.500> uh

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and like burst killer and downer and uh

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.030 
and like burst killer and downer and uh
and<00:01:50.460> finisher<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.659> guess<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> best<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and finisher I guess is the best that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.560 
and finisher I guess is the best that
kind<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.460> sounded<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.180> guess<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
kind of sounded really I guess you could

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.209 
kind of sounded really I guess you could
say<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.140> she<00:01:55.290> said<00:01:55.560> everything<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
say that's what she said everything I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.039 
say that's what she said everything I
just<00:01:56.250> said<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.579> there<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.810> think

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
just said right there but I don't think

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
just said right there but I don't think
that<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> goal<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> Ranger<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.240> on

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that the goal of the Ranger is to be on

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.350 
that the goal of the Ranger is to be on
the<00:02:01.290> front<00:02:01.560> lines<00:02:01.890> being<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.610> top<00:02:02.850> damage

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the front lines being the top damage

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470

particular<00:05:04.620> build<00:05:05.069> I'm<00:05:05.190> running<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.550> still

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
particular build I'm running I still

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.059 
particular build I'm running I still
have<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.240> quickness<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:07.080> pet<00:05:07.349> swap<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.009> do

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
have the quickness on pet swap and I do

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.680 
have the quickness on pet swap and I do
run<00:05:08.400> with<00:05:08.520> quickening<00:05:08.940> Zephyr<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.270> think<00:05:09.539> those

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
run with quickening Zephyr I think those

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.659 
run with quickening Zephyr I think those
are<00:05:09.720> kind<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.169> two<00:05:10.349> mandatory<00:05:10.889> things<00:05:11.430> that

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
are kind of two mandatory things that

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.640 
are kind of two mandatory things that
you<00:05:11.729> have<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.090> get<00:05:12.479> in<00:05:12.659> your<00:05:12.780> traits<00:05:13.139> they're

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you have to get in your traits they're

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.070 
you have to get in your traits they're
just<00:05:13.830> too<00:05:14.009> good<00:05:14.310> they're<00:05:15.090> too<00:05:15.330> good<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:15.870> not

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
just too good they're too good to not

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.070 
just too good they're too good to not
have<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:17.330> don't<00:05:18.330> know<00:05:18.389> quickening<00:05:18.750> Zephyr<00:05:18.960> I

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
have I don't know quickening Zephyr I

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.719 
have I don't know quickening Zephyr I
think<00:05:19.289> it's<00:05:19.409> probably<00:05:19.560> best<00:05:19.889> utility<00:05:20.430> skill

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
think it's probably best utility skill

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.909 
think it's probably best utility skill
for<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.150> Ranger<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.840> know<00:05:22.500> some<00:05:22.860> people

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
for the Ranger I know some people

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.499 
for the Ranger I know some people
probably<00:05:23.340> don't<00:05:23.550> like<00:05:23.699> it<00:05:24.030> say<00:05:24.240> it's<00:05:24.389> not

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
probably don't like it say it's not

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.480 
probably don't like it say it's not
necessary<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.229> when<00:05:25.349> you<00:05:25.440> really<00:05:25.590> need<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:25.860> to

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
necessary but when you really need to to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.240
