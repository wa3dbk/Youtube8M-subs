00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
fat at all into it so what you're doing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
fat at all into it so what you're doing
is<00:00:27.599> introducing<00:00:27.840> moisture<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.279> bit

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is introducing moisture and a little bit

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.279
