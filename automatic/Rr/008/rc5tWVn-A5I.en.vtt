00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.550
 Hello, good afternoon everyone, I'm steak 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.200
 the and today we are here where you will 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.390
 be a combat in which I am going to 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.550
 show a strategy of a team that 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.880
 I saw that I found it quite weird and 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.529
 quite suicidal but good to me the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.840
 I really liked the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.430
 I tried to try and man do not you the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.859
 I recommend using it because it's not very 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.910
 effective but nevertheless I found it an 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.199
 worthy strategy to see and at least 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.150
 quite peculiar so just 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.460
 I wanted to share it with all of you 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.379
 well as you can see it is an over format 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.750
 I'm just against a storm team 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.850
 of sand and me, because here you see the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.839
 strategy that is with a whip your 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.510
 whips defensive industry or a doublet 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.739
 a smart girl I do not remember the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.960
 name a joy of sight I think it 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 llama does not say forgiveness a goal and a 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890
 place me well first of all comment 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.799
 a little bit of what the strategy of this 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.960
 team that is being place I am the 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.340
 initial that will use reflex 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.060
 light screen and then going to do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.259
 legacy to lower the rival's attack the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.390
 most people are going to stay 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.679
 saying this is a has no fucking 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.869
 idea of ​​what you are doing how you 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.939
 puts legacy to goodbye well we are going 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.939
 to take advantage and get our duch threesome 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.439
 or our let dick that have shade 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.310
 trap and they will prevent the rival 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.110
 change 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.360
 let's take advantage let's put traps 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.969
 rocks and we're going to use legacy again 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 that we are going to use with this we are going to 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.310
 make the opponent have a computer use 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.319
 a useless pokémon with no attack and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 that will be stuck at that moment 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.159
 let's take out our smer gay smer 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 girl is going to take to spend with 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.489
 I relay a drum bust and a bust of 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.840
 the fence that increases your speed 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.689
 so he's going to go through four in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.459
 attack and by 1.5 in speed to our 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.179
 sweater that in this case is luca saw that 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.729
 going to sweep 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.219
 to the whole team salsa is the strategy 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 basic and here it has come out so 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.179
 first of all let's go to see the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 combat and good as you can see is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.179
 we take our whip to our 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.670
 watios against the podium although the rival 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 an attack of special type is expected by 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 that brings out his gastro don but not me 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 I use reflex 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.980
 well after reflex I will use 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
 light screen as I told you before 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.330
 is going to hit us with ice lightning is not going to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.330
 do a lot of damage and then we're going to 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.490
 hit with him I have already told you with a legacy 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.720
 lowering the attack the physical attack and the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.120
 special attack of this gastro don 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.480
 We were going to take out our double now 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.490
 ticket that will throw rock traps and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.250
 then he's going to hit us with a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.200
 South will not kill us because we have the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.060
 light screen and he has lowered the attack 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.460
 special and we're going to hit again with 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.440
 legacy leaving you as you see quite 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.850
 unusable and here we are going to take out smart 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.280
 girl the rival is going to stop being 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.500
 stuck and it's going to change I'm going to do 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.410
 substitute and he's going to hit us with the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.720
 power I do not know why I do not change no no 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.390
 I have an idea here I use belli drum and 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.910
 you know drum is going to up the attack and 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.370
 the speed the follow is going to use another 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.830
 live earth again and I'm going here 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.930
 take advantage to use the relay and 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.420
 pass this for 4 in attack and this for 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.610
 1.5 in speed to the user well we 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.590
 it makes land alive and despite being quite 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.270
 effective we resist it perfectly in 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.130
 we hit with game punch 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.680
 and we recover comment also that 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.020
 this place I have tape band focus 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.520
 so that they do not kill us at one stroke and as 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.620
 have you already know 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.540
 draw fist then we can use 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.280
 focus bands several times we are going to 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.200
 hit with a bullet yo as you can see 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.000
 to get us to dynamite the strip or 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.610
 take a hit for the similar sector 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.320
 a 30 I did not expect me to do or 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.960
 bullet pancho something a bullet fist not what 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.640
 did without problem and here you can see 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.890
 is autlan makes us 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.600
 williams I think it's cruel volt we 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.850
 it takes half of life but we hit 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.560
 with drake punch with fist draw and we 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.480
 we recover then enough life not the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.300
 enough for the damage that was done 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430
 of recoil and life sphere does not take off 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.860
 the gift of an ice fist is also 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.090
 will go out and already the last rival of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.130
 everything is the last because mount of 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.160
 piety 'that's going to be magnet on that's going 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.500
 to eat a reimplant you already know a fist 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.080
 of drainage and we're going to kill him so 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.080
 nothing this is going to be the fight so far 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.580
 you already know I really wanted to upload the 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.010
 I fought because the strategy seemed to me 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.720
 very original and very striking for nothing 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.910
 is very good that is to say the best for 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.360
 win three matches I had to throw 15 is 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.180
 tell 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.240
 Nothing effective but good enough 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.759
 well especially because people do not know what 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.469
 expected in fact many people would throw me the 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.069
 quarrel in plans but how do you use that 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:42.169
 I know how I will have peace, I sweat it like this 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.900
 that nothing you see is a team the truth 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.729
 is that it is not at all something that you have 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.580
 what to use specifically but good 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.319
 can serve to surprise some friend 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.479
 for if you get bored of your team 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.509
 so try this to see if you get the 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.520
 swept and nothing you already know you liked 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.500
 that useful result has made you pass a 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.889
 good time to give like i subscribe to you 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.029
 it really helps a lot and nothing I hope that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.099
 have you really liked that you have 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.099
 enjoyed with the video come up for
