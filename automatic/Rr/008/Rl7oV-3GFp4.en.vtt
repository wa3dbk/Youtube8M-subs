00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good but today they give you tomorrow they take you away 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.220
 Pablo, this is part of the game. 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 to live with what they gave him the week 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 passed on an equator in Quito and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.590
 sets touched missed passes in all 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 parts happens to all teams 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
 it was obvious it was true it was a shame 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.420
 it's true but this time they took them and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.420
 ready 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:34.590
 all the equipment is also very well 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:40.370
 but if we stay with that then the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.370
 story of the game too 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.230
 If there are errors, it is a mistake 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.230
 yellow appreciation 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.290
 and good beginner multiplies them 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 from the yellow the truth that there will be 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 to go over the split amount that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.660
 directed and what is your average of the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.160
 three influencing the result be 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.870
 it ends up influencing because it did not mark a 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.790
 criminal did not mark an expulsion that also 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.440
 as an action it can be debatable it expels 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 antonio valencia that is to say there is a series 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.890
 of factors that make you not say was 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.160
 totally disastrous about marÃ­n vargas 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.940
 you put yourself today in a reflective place 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.070
 and else 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.170
 if this happened to Colombia in front of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.950
 chile until it was unleashed and it has 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.190
 past 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 Pauline can happen to Argentina 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 can happen to anyone and that's why 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.690
 to be focused to know that today 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:53.880
 is a criminal today you feel sorry 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 good two victories and have won the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.690
 choices that are below but 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.690
 perfect but it's part of the game not 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:14.629
 with technology with the use of two 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:14.629
 arbitrators more than I speak
