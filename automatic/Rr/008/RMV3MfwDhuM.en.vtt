00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.349
 do you know what we recognize 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.509
 new ducati monster sweet years and ben 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.929
 it's not complicated everything is new 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.240
 is new 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.990
 it has nothing to do with the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 previous models 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 finished the air-cooled engine 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 we now have an engine 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.579
 testastretta 11 Â° but cooling 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.829
 liquid which displays more than 100 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 kilowatts in its full power version 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.539
 that is about 145 horses well 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.539
 heard the French version will be bridled 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.609
 at 106 horses maximum is 78 kilowatts 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 but we can already tell you 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.629
 with such an architecture and a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.530
 such a machine is a safe bet that this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.570
 is a tear arm simply 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.829
 this new monster also has 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.780
 a practical aspect 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.760
 besides his new tank with a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.110
 very soft design online 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.000
 particularly fluid 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.380
 we will notice an adjustable saddle on 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.729
 several positions children authors 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.560
 between 785 mm and 810 mm for the rest 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.110
 lets you appreciate the engine is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 bearer ie there as well 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.159
 the back loop as the chassis 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.049
 front tubular are fixed directly 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.570
 on it and tubing 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.850
 new exhaust manifolds offer 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.910
 a simply sumptuous drawing a 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.509
 drawing reminiscent of the diavel 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.800
 instrumentation and well 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.110
 the instrumentation is fully 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.060
 digital with a color LCD display 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.039
 allowing you to choose both 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.530
 information that the type of display that 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.740
 we want to have the audience are 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.539
 many we will see an abs a control 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.610
 traction and all the information 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.679
 useful that we can wish on this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.080
 motorcycle type or even more 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.360
 crossing between a diavel is a 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.020
 old my score in this sense the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.689
 news 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 boussens is a monster simply 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.420
 one feels very strong presence among 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.950
 legs 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.069
 the driving position is once of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.530
 more sporty tipped on the front we have 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.599
 a comfortable saddle comfort we 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.330
 bring back anyway on the tank 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.799
 the deck is beautiful we are comfortable 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.420
 it's a ducati 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.040
 now there is more to see 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
 what it looks like on the road but there is 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.480
 it's a safe bet that the rowing is at the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.940
 feather height especially knowing 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 ducati and the health of this engine that one 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.790
 already knows especially about the devil
