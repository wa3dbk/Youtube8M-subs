00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
objective c lesson and today we're going

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
objective c lesson and today we're going
to<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.380> talking<00:00:13.559> about<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:14.040> statements<00:00:14.639> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
to be talking about if statements so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500 
to be talking about if statements so
let's<00:00:15.360> dig<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:16.279> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.430> download<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.000> Xcode

first<00:00:23.160> thing<00:00:23.340> we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> talk<00:00:23.850> about

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
first thing we're going to talk about

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.900 
first thing we're going to talk about
our<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.960> statements<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.760> are

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
our if statements and if you are

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
our if statements and if you are
familiar<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.449> other<00:00:27.810> programming

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
familiar with other programming

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
familiar with other programming
languages<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.310> will<00:00:29.429> probably<00:00:30.060> pick<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.900> up

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
languages you will probably pick this up

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
languages you will probably pick this up
really<00:00:31.289> easily<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.520> those<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.059> guys

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
really easily and for those of you guys

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.139 
really easily and for those of you guys
who<00:00:33.239> aren't<00:00:33.930> programmers<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:35.370> statements<00:00:36.000> are

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
who aren't programmers if statements are

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.910 
who aren't programmers if statements are
basically<00:00:36.690> something<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.710> do

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
basically something that you do

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
basically something that you do
unconsciously<00:00:38.480> without<00:00:39.480> even<00:00:39.780> knowing<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
unconsciously without even knowing it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
unconsciously without even knowing it
when<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.610> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
when you think about something there are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.160 
when you think about something there are
times<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.960> if

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
times where you're going to think if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
times where you're going to think if
some<00:00:43.829> sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> condition<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
some sort of condition then I'm going to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
some sort of condition then I'm going to
do<00:00:45.840> something<00:00:46.079> else<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.370> I'm

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
do something else if it's this then I'm

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
do something else if it's this then I'm
going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.690> when<00:00:49.020> you're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to do that well when you're

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.630 
going to do that well when you're
writing<00:00:49.350> code<00:00:49.500> well<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.309> you're<00:00:50.460> writing

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
writing code well when you're writing

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
writing code well when you're writing
code<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.270> statements<00:00:52.050> allow<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.710> make

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
code if statements allow you to make

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000 
code if statements allow you to make
those<00:00:53.100> sorts<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> decisions<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.170> i<00:00:55.620> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
those sorts of decisions so if i just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
those sorts of decisions so if i just
type<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:57.410> Xcode<00:00:58.410> already<00:00:58.969> assumes<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
type in if Xcode already assumes that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
type in if Xcode already assumes that
that's<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.430> see

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that's what i want to do and you can see

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
that's what i want to do and you can see
from<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.199> there<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.439> two<00:01:04.619> parts<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> if

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
from here there are two parts to the if

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
from here there are two parts to the if
statement<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.090> condition<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
statement the condition and the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
statement the condition and the
statements<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.070> example<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.909> declare

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
statements for example if I just declare

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
statements for example if I just declare
a<00:01:09.330> variable<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.380> let's<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.890> say<00:01:11.159> its

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
a variable up here let's just say its

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.450 
a variable up here let's just say its
age<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.409> let's<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.470> give<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> 10<00:01:16.189> now<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> want

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
age and let's just give it 10 now I want

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
age and let's just give it 10 now I want
to<00:01:17.520> say<00:01:17.700> something<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.020> variable

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to say something like if the variable

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.630 
to say something like if the variable
age<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.979> above<00:01:20.310> 10<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> do

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
age is above 10 then I want to do

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.109 
age is above 10 then I want to do
something<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
something so all I would have to do is

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.990 
something so all I would have to do is
use<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.509> greater<00:01:28.290> than<00:01:28.530> comparison<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.430> see

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
use the greater than comparison and see

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.510 
use the greater than comparison and see
if<00:01:30.240> h<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.140> greater<00:01:31.530> than<00:01:32.009> 10<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.509> i

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
if h is greater than 10 then in here i

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.520 
if h is greater than 10 then in here i
can<00:01:35.520> write<00:01:35.729> whatever<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:37.710> something

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
can write whatever I want do something

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
can write whatever I want do something
now<00:01:40.530> there's<00:01:40.740> another<00:01:40.890> part<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
now there's another part to the if

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.800 
now there's another part to the if
statement<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> else<00:01:43.799> clause<00:01:47.810> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
statement and that's the else clause and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.190 
statement and that's the else clause and
I<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:50.070> something<00:01:50.100> else<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.420> when

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
I can do something else here so when

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.889 
I can do something else here so when
this<00:01:52.799> code<00:01:53.100> runs<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.820> checks<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> variable

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this code runs it checks the variable

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
this code runs it checks the variable
age<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.219> greater<00:01:56.460> than<00:01:56.549> 10<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
age if it's greater than 10 if it is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
age if it's greater than 10 if it is
then<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> run<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.439> branch<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
then it's going to run this branch and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.510 
then it's going to run this branch and
if<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.409> below<00:02:01.710> 10<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.340> going

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
if it's not if it's below 10 it's going

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
if it's not if it's below 10 it's going
to<00:02:02.579> run<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.270> code<00:02:03.509> down<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.280> it'll<00:02:05.280> never

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
to run this code down here it'll never

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
to run this code down here it'll never
do<00:02:05.700> both<00:02:06.530> now<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.729> other<00:02:08.970> stuff<00:02:09.420> let's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
do both now you can do other stuff let's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.860 
do both now you can do other stuff let's
say<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.950> two<00:02:11.160> conditions<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.690> can

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
say that you have two conditions you can

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.620 
say that you have two conditions you can
have<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:13.379> L

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
have an L

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.290 
have an L
if<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.970> age<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.690> greater<00:02:17.260> than<00:02:17.500> 10<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:19.060> do

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
if if age is greater than 10 then do

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020 
if if age is greater than 10 then do
something<00:02:19.570> if<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:21.010> greater<00:02:21.340> than<00:02:21.370> seven

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
something if it's greater than seven

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.630 
something if it's greater than seven
then<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:23.020> something<00:02:23.260> else<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.800> then<00:02:24.010> finally

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
then do something else and then finally

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.450 
then do something else and then finally
if<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.690> none<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.960> those<00:02:26.320> two<00:02:26.620> conditions<00:02:29.460> do

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
if it's none of those two conditions do

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.650 
if it's none of those two conditions do
something<00:02:30.880> else<00:02:31.060> here<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.690> something<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:33.270> H<00:02:34.270> is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
something else here do something if H is

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.890 
something else here do something if H is
over<00:02:35.320> 10<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:37.060> condition<00:02:37.360> do

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
over 10 and in this condition do

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.180 
over 10 and in this condition do
something<00:02:38.290> else<00:02:38.500> if<00:02:38.860> age<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.550> over<00:02:40.300> seven<00:02:41.190> so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
something else if age is over seven so

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.140 
something else if age is over seven so
when<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.580> checking<00:02:42.850> age<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.660> might<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:45.150> this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
when it's checking age it might in this

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190 
when it's checking age it might in this
example<00:02:46.330> because<00:02:46.720> age<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.260> 10<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
example because age is 10 it is not this

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720 
example because age is 10 it is not this
condition<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.710> not<00:02:50.890> true<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.580> actually

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
condition is not true so it's actually

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.960 
condition is not true so it's actually
going<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.300> fall<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.920> check<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.520> next

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
going to fall and check this next

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.740 
going to fall and check this next
condition<00:02:55.210> if<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.250> greater<00:02:57.250> than<00:02:57.280> 7<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.060> it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
condition if it's greater than 7 and it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.720 
condition if it's greater than 7 and it
is<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.770> 10<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.190> it's<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.640> to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is is we have 10 there it's going to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.390 
is is we have 10 there it's going to
actually<00:03:00.970> execute<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.830> if<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.070> had<00:03:03.190> changed

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
actually execute this if I had changed

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.820 
actually execute this if I had changed
this<00:03:03.670> variable<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.300> 5<00:03:04.600> then<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.680> would

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
this variable to a 5 then it would

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.980 
this variable to a 5 then it would
actually<00:03:05.950> run<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.370> code<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:07.120> simple<00:03:07.960> but

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
actually run the code in here simple but

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.960 
actually run the code in here simple but
powerful<00:03:08.320> you'll<00:03:08.830> find<00:03:09.040> yourself<00:03:09.130> using<00:03:09.550> if

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
powerful you'll find yourself using if

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.330 
powerful you'll find yourself using if
statements<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.930> lot<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.230> your<00:03:11.380> code<00:03:11.650> now<00:03:12.070> some

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
statements a lot in your code now some

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.700 
statements a lot in your code now some
other<00:03:12.490> examples<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.810> don't<00:03:14.020> have<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.500> be

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
other examples you don't have to be

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.920 
other examples you don't have to be
using<00:03:15.160> an<00:03:15.280> integer<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.060> example<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:16.630> did

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
using an integer in this example we did

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.880 
using an integer in this example we did
you<00:03:17.110> could<00:03:17.290> even<00:03:17.710> use<00:03:18.930> objects<00:03:19.930> or<00:03:20.170> strings<00:03:20.560> or

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
you could even use objects or strings or

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.560 
you could even use objects or strings or
something<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.760> let's<00:03:22.060> look<00:03:22.210> at<00:03:22.420> an

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
something like that so let's look at an

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.810 
something like that so let's look at an
example<00:03:22.600> where<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.770> want<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.190> compare<00:03:24.760> a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
example where we want to compare a

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.190 
example where we want to compare a
string<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.780> let's<00:03:25.990> say<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.170> had<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.950> name<00:03:29.400> corey

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
string so let's say I had a name corey

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.350 
string so let's say I had a name corey
and<00:03:32.200> i<00:03:32.260> wanted<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.710> write<00:03:33.040> an<00:03:33.670> if<00:03:33.850> statement<00:03:33.970> i

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
and i wanted to write an if statement i

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.020 
and i wanted to write an if statement i
want<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.630> execute<00:03:35.140> some<00:03:35.350> code<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.610> name<00:03:36.820> is

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
want to execute some code if the name is

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.730 
want to execute some code if the name is
Corey<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.710> I<00:03:39.100> could<00:03:39.840> use<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> method<00:03:41.350> that's

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
Corey so I could use a method that's

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.840 
Corey so I could use a method that's
part<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.400> NS<00:03:42.730> string<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:44.190> compare<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:47.850> to

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
part of the NS string and compare it to

00:03:48.850 --> 00:04:00.820 
part of the NS string and compare it to
Corey<00:03:52.530> do<00:03:53.530> something<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.580> name<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.420> Corey<00:03:57.330> else

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.280 

do<00:04:01.830> something<00:04:02.489> else<00:04:02.879> if<00:04:03.270> name<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:04.140> not<00:04:04.590> Cory<00:04:06.290> so

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
do something else if name is not Cory so

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.820 
do something else if name is not Cory so
in<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.920> example<00:04:08.129> here<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.300> variable

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
in this example here I have a variable

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.130 
in this example here I have a variable
with<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:11.099> string<00:04:11.370> Corey<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:13.019> this

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
with the string Corey in it and in this

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.110 
with the string Corey in it and in this
if<00:04:13.410> statement<00:04:13.530> i'm<00:04:14.010> checking<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.760> name

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
if statement i'm checking if the name

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.449 
if statement i'm checking if the name
variable<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.780> equal<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> string<00:04:16.769> Corey

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
variable is equal to the string Corey

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.379 
variable is equal to the string Corey
now<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.780> add<00:04:18.959> something<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:20.519> !

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
now you can add something like this !

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.480 
now you can add something like this !
and<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.470> equivalent<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
and that is the equivalent of the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.750 
and that is the equivalent of the
negative<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.330> now<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.229> reads<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.770> name<00:04:26.580> is

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
negative so now this reads if name is

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.570 
negative so now this reads if name is
not<00:04:27.060> equal<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.660> Corey<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:29.280> actually

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
not equal to Corey so this actually

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
not equal to Corey so this actually
becomes<00:04:30.000> if<00:04:30.510> name<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:31.430> not<00:04:32.430> Cory<00:04:33.260> then<00:04:34.260> do

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
becomes if name is not Cory then do

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.890 
becomes if name is not Cory then do
something<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.130> then<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.090> elf<00:04:36.360> statement

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
something and then this elf statement

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.600 
something and then this elf statement
obviously<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:38.780> let's<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.930> something<00:04:40.320> else

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
obviously is let's do something else

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.350 
obviously is let's do something else
likewise<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.910> here<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.620> could<00:04:43.620> say<00:04:43.889> if<00:04:44.190> name<00:04:45.150> is

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
likewise in here I could say if name is

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.920 
likewise in here I could say if name is
not<00:04:45.600> equal<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.139> 10<00:04:46.530> then<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.400> something<00:04:47.669> if<00:04:48.120> is

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
not equal to 10 then do something if is

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.080 
not equal to 10 then do something if is
not<00:04:49.500> equal<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:51.510> 10<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.889> in<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.190> case<00:04:53.460> where

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
not equal to 10 so in this case where

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.610 
not equal to 10 so in this case where
age<00:04:54.360> is<00:04:54.630> 5<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.590> would<00:04:55.889> come<00:04:56.100> into<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:56.610> branch

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
age is 5 it would come into this branch

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.870 
age is 5 it would come into this branch
so<00:04:58.620> what<00:04:58.740> do<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.889> think<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.280> if<00:04:59.400> statement

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
so what do you think of the if statement

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.370 
so what do you think of the if statement
in<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.360> next<00:05:00.630> lesson<00:05:00.780> we're<00:05:01.139> going<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.290> learn

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
in the next lesson we're going to learn

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.530 
in the next lesson we're going to learn
about<00:05:01.580> conditional<00:05:02.580> operators<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.330> how<00:05:03.389> we

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
about conditional operators and how we

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.879 
about conditional operators and how we
can<00:05:03.660> start<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.110> chain<00:05:04.380> those<00:05:04.590> conditions

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
can start to chain those conditions

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.580 
can start to chain those conditions
together<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.760> form<00:05:06.060> even<00:05:06.570> more<00:05:06.930> powerful<00:05:07.260> if

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
together and form even more powerful if

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.840 
together and form even more powerful if
