 all this right now we start 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 If I had to say three principles 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.680
 main ones that bring us consume 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.079
 notes look at our supplementation 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.629
 daily one of them would be for example 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.960
 that helps us increase the levels of 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.300
 muscle glycogen the next would be 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.010
 that helps us in terms of 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.170
 muscle recovery after a hard 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.960
 training a third and the last one by 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.670
 example would be that it helps us in terms of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 improve the immune function of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.159

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.280
 125 grams of glutamine between one and three 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.460
 times a day you can do it every morning 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 late and night one hour before sleeping or 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.510
 if you can not also consume 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 and after training and one hour before 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.050
 of sleeping is the most recommendable there is no 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.060
