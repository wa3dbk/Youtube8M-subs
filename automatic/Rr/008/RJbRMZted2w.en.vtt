00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
naturally isn't just one color so this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.620 
naturally isn't just one color so this
is<00:02:16.980> why<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.220> using<00:02:17.400> two<00:02:17.700> different<00:02:18.060> colors

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.610 

it's<00:02:21.630> important<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.350> two<00:02:22.590> different

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's important to use two different

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:34.520 
it's important to use two different
colors<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.569> spoolie<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.290> just

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
going to blend that out blend the two

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.930 
going to blend that out blend the two
colors<00:02:36.810> together<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.489> some<00:02:38.670> wax
