improve<00:02:10.940> your<00:02:11.269> day<00:02:11.480> your<00:02:11.810> day<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:12.230> always<00:02:12.560> be

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
improve your day your day can always be

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.449 
improve your day your day can always be
better<00:02:12.739> than<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.220> was<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.480> you're<00:02:15.459> constantly

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
better than it was so you're constantly

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.910 
better than it was so you're constantly
look<00:02:16.850> forward<00:02:17.269> as<00:02:17.450> far<00:02:18.140> as<00:02:18.290> look<00:02:18.440> what<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.830> we

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
look forward as far as look what can we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.740 
look forward as far as look what can we
reduce<00:02:19.069> when<00:02:19.640> Apple<00:02:19.910> sits<00:02:20.090> down<00:02:20.239> like<00:02:20.480> how<00:02:20.600> can

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
reduce when Apple sits down like how can

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.870 
reduce when Apple sits down like how can
we<00:02:20.840> improve<00:02:21.049> our<00:02:21.410> computer<00:02:21.860> sit<00:02:22.459> down<00:02:22.519> for

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
we improve our computer sit down for

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.280 
we improve our computer sit down for
weeks<00:02:23.060> that's<00:02:23.569> all<00:02:23.690> they<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:23.959> improve

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
weeks that's all they do is improve

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.070 
weeks that's all they do is improve
their<00:02:24.500> computer<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.280> I've<00:02:25.400> ever<00:02:25.459> done

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
their computer it's all I've ever done

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.900 
their computer it's all I've ever done
same<00:02:27.080> with<00:02:27.230> any<00:02:27.350> kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.739> software<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.610> any

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
same with any kind of software so any

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.089 
same with any kind of software so any
human<00:02:29.209> being<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> human<00:02:30.500> being<00:02:30.799> should

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
human being you as a human being should

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.670 
human being you as a human being should
sit<00:02:31.310> down<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.760> say<00:02:31.940> hmm<00:02:32.510> how<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.560> improve

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
sit down and say hmm how can I improve

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.180 
sit down and say hmm how can I improve
everything<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.940> make<00:02:35.090> me<00:02:35.810> better<00:02:36.320> how<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.040> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
everything to make me better how do I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.270 
everything to make me better how do I
become<00:02:37.670> better<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:39.650> times<00:02:40.040> like

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
become better and it it's times like

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.009 
become better and it it's times like
when<00:02:40.400> your<00:02:40.640> computer<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.120> screwing<00:02:41.570> up<00:02:41.720> where

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
when your computer is screwing up where

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.610 
when your computer is screwing up where
you<00:02:42.109> kind<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:44.019> even<00:02:45.019> something<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
you kind of see that even something you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.920 
you kind of see that even something you
rely<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.130> isn't<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> machine<00:02:47.329> is<00:02:47.720> never

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
rely on isn't like a machine is never

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.199 
rely on isn't like a machine is never
perfect<00:02:48.200> nothing's<00:02:48.890> ever<00:02:49.040> perfect<00:02:49.310> nothing

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
perfect nothing's ever perfect nothing

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.630 
perfect nothing's ever perfect nothing
is<00:02:50.390> perfect<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.500> only<00:02:51.829> perfect<00:02:52.070> thing<00:02:52.400> is

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
is perfect the only perfect thing is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.020 
is perfect the only perfect thing is
like<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.420> um<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.680> Pythagorean<00:02:55.370> theorem<00:02:55.850> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
like that um the Pythagorean theorem I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.560 
like that um the Pythagorean theorem I
think<00:02:56.359> it<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.480> we're<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.010> seashells<00:02:58.570> will

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
think it is we're like seashells will

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.990 
think it is we're like seashells will
like<00:03:00.010> always<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.250> same<00:03:01.519> they<00:03:01.760> always<00:03:01.910> be

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
like always be the same they always be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.059 
like always be the same they always be
that<00:03:02.120> mathematical<00:03:02.750> spiral<00:03:03.200> thing<00:03:03.440> that's

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
that mathematical spiral thing that's

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.740 
that mathematical spiral thing that's
perfect<00:03:04.609> but<00:03:04.730> everything<00:03:05.060> else<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.390> screwed

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
perfect but everything else is screwed

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.220 
perfect but everything else is screwed
so<00:03:06.319> I'm<00:03:07.209> hanging<00:03:08.209> tight<00:03:08.420> hopefully<00:03:09.079> tomorrow

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
so I'm hanging tight hopefully tomorrow

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.680 
so I'm hanging tight hopefully tomorrow
you'll<00:03:09.709> get<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.609> something<00:03:11.239> better<00:03:11.420> than<00:03:11.569> an

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
you'll get a something better than an

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.440 
you'll get a something better than an
iphone<00:03:11.780> video<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.760> we<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.910> improve<00:03:14.209> our

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
