00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Brazil on railing rodrigo alvarez 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 talk live from são paulo rodrigo as 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 than your prizes of the future where Ana 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.799
 Have a good day, everyone, because it's time to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 Monday we have been talking here 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.320
 of bureaucratic scrap mainly 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 of abandonment of what was once this great 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.949
 project of national integration through 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.609
 three passengers 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.410
 now in this latest report will tell 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 to point our locomotive forward 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.690
 to talk I'll tell you now 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 right what will be the future of the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.180
 passenger trains here in Brazil gives 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.489
 to imagine a train of these connecting the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.930
 to São Paulo and then to São Paulo. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 campinas 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 the project exists if the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 confirmed market will cost between 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 40 and 50 billion reais with money 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 public and private 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 a trip without delays in airports 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.680
 without road bursts 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.970
 to compete with the buses 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.970
 mainly with airplanes 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.350
 but what would be the model for the future 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.320
 Here in Brazil 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.300
 whichever the chosen one will be the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.369
 first new train project 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.150
 long-distance passengers in more than 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 40 years old 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 one of the oldest stations are 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.010
 the coordinator of the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.590
 logistics of the foundation cabral 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.440
 questions the model proposed by the government 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.300
 for the high-speed train and whether it is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.230
 economically viable 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.050
 he would have to carry it a year 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.150
 what the river airlift sao paulo 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.190
 transport of more than 25 million 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.080
 people in your assessment is a mistake to make 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.650
 the work now that time has not 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 no doubt that an error is from us 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.260
 we could think of him after this 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.380
 decade ten years ahead 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.690
 it is a fresh start for an isolated project and we 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 we will really put efforts into the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.780
 sense of transport of 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.540
 passengers even if it is in the same 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.830
 lines that are being expanded by 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.440
 shipping charges 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.130
 are underway the six projects 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.570
 long distance passenger trains 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.280
 in são paulo government proposal 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.260
 state is an extension of the lines that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.910
 today circulate in the metropolitan region 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.740
 taking the passenger trains against 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.250
 three cities in the interior 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.840
 sorocaba santos and jundiaí there is also 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.730
 the project of a public partnership 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.060
 to call Belo Horizonte seven 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.070
 lagoons black leather and divinópolis and still 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.570
 the design of another train between 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.090
 Brasilia and Goiânia 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.190
 other studies are under study 14 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.290
 stretches connecting mainly regions 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420
 metropolitan and medium cities 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.220
 are projects in the south and southeast 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.740
 that in most cases 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.420
 involve partnerships between the states and 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.310
 ministry of transportation 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.770
 if everything that is planned is really 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.770
 built will be more than 3,300 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.720
 kilometers of new lines by 2020 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.920
 companies will want to increase their 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.480
 your lines 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.020
 they will want to bring services 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.140
 best 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.410
 they will want to tighten the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.239
 most attractive value 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.600
 So I believe that if we do 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:28.970
 Calm down, very calmly. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.480
 some 30 years we regain culture 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.400
 of the passenger train in Brazil and the valley 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 as an incentive there is a light in 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.550
 very high speed 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.180
 the engineer in France testing the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.200
 limits of a locomotive 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.090
 they managed to accelerate to 574.8 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.870
 kilometers per hour and hit a 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.870
 speed record 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.410
 Alright, no one wants to break records. 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.550
 here, but walking fast without delay and 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.550
 no congestion would be a great 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.550
 fresh start 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.030
 We'll talk live back here in the 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.919
 light station in sao paulo a good one 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.829
 example of what happened in history was 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.750
 inaugurated in 1980 to withstand the 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.690
 the 1930s began to take 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.160
 long distance passengers but 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.160
 little by little it was transformed into 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.630
 that we see here today a season 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.520
 important part of transporting 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.770
 passengers in the metropolitan area of 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.510
 São Paulo, the federal government says that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.940
 studies a high-speed line 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.060
 between são paulo and belo horizonte too 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.400
 and another one between são paulo and curitiba 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.340
 but this would only happen after this 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.340
 bullet train connecting rio campinas that are 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.710
 paulo chico speaks in resumption but by 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.790
 while they are only promises 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.790
 and when will it be?
