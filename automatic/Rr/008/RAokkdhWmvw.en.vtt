 Do you want to buy a new name that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.350
 bought the new fire this appliance has 8 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.530
 gb of internal memory 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.739

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.659
 When you buy a new one you have 2.55 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.110
 gigas used exactly the same as mine 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.720
 free space to show you guys 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.600
 who bought an eight-gigabyte device 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.200
 I'll find 2,5 already used 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.790
 of the eight gigs you'll get in real 7.2 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:24.010
 gigas free for you and used 2,5 or 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:27.880
 be this whole mess only 4.7 gigs 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.090
 will be available for music games and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.850
 photos finally clear memory card can 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.270
 but media only 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.870
 can within this memory that is 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.180
 You only have 4.7 gigas for you. 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.100
 install games and applications on your behalf 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.560
 eight gigabytes of memory 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.750
 remembering asphalt 7 the photos are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.950
 Flame Release 8 alone occupies 3.2 gigs 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 when installed 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.440
 so the tip for you is the space 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.420
 free on the new fire is exactly this 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.980
 here it may vary upwards to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.429
 low but average 4.7 gigs available 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.119
 For you it's little, it's very little, it's very 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.819
 little 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.310
 so it's the tip for you and these 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.420
 they have that way pretty in the installation 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.739
 of applications 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.720
 So that 's it folks this is the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.800
 amount of giggs available 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.209
 in your new name 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.269
 that's why we do not always recommend 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.870
 you use a memory card and in the case 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.800
 of the memory card of many many 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.020
 extra space for photos and videos 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 add bookmarks

 And remember, folks like I just said 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.000
 little gigas to install applications 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.760
