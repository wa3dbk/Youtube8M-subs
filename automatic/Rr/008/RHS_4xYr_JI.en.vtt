00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:17.240
 current non-african humans 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.699
 are descendants of neardentales all 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.050
 people of origin or African are 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.840
 descendants of the men of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.300
 Neanderthal, according to scientists 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.629
 Mexicans who analyzed the chromosomes 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.930
 x of the representatives of numerous 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:36.350
 countries this is from samples of people 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.680
 of the different countries the study that 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.900
 was published in the magazine of one of the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.390
 well-known Mexican university the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.700
 Neandertals and humans are species 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.680
 closely related long ago 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.410
 the scientists opposed that these 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.690
 species could have crossed both 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.720
 species the current man and the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.220
 Neanderthals appeared in Africa and 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
 considers that the ancestors of the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.079
 Neanderthals left the continent 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.490
 black within the period from 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.079
 400 to 800 thousand before Christ in turn 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.210
 the ancestors of human beings 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.490
 they left Africa and started their 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.650
 migration to other territories in the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.170
 period of between 80,000 and 50,000 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.990
 back in fact before the disappearance 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.260
 of the Neanderthals that occurred 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.310
 30 thousand years the species could have 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.840
 coexist the authors of the study 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.930
 they found that modern men and 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 the Neanderthals had mixed 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.530
 studying the DNA sequences of 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.960
 X chromosome that is inherited only by 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.850
 female lineage in the inhabitants of 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.580
 all continents 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.530
 and this done this it is said that the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.810
 current men are the descendants 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.570
 of the homo sapiens and the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.770
 Neanderthals there was a crossing between 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.500
 both and the chromosome x DNA was mixed 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 This is a theory of the Mexican Unam
