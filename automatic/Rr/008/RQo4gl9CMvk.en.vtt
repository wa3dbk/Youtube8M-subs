00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.850
 Y 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.850
 ah 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.240
 ah 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.620
 the materials that we are going to need 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.090
 it will be rubber eva or flame 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.360
 rubber band 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.050
 scissors a punch to mark on the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.050
 shape in the rubber eva or if we prefer 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.329
 or a stick of these wooden evils 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.629
 lengths that are used to make the 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.660
 skewers or skewers and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.840
 we will also need the templates os 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.129
 I'm going to leave several models on the blog 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.920
 it's worth it so you can download it 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.199
 then I leave you the model of the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.780
 turtles girls you know that if you change 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.120
 is the color of the mask you can make 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.820
 the 4 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.920
 another model is the batman mask that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.290
 is what I'm going to do in the video and 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.090
 also these others that are more 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.250
 simple 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.290
 OK 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.510
 as I told you these templates 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.480
 all will be available on the blog 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.280
 to download first of all we go 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.160
 to download the template we want 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.540
 do and we 're going to cut it 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.130
 remember that these are the eyes so 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.690
 we also have to cut it with 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 careful, and of these two little circles 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.440
 will be where we have a series of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.440
 holes to place the rubber 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.650
 to trim the eyes and not have to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.040
 fold the paper what I do is click 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.320
 with the punch until I open it 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.990
 fix and now this is easy 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 cut out with scissors 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.420
 although you can also use a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 cutter 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.040
 and once I have the most expensive 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.880
 clipped what I'm going to do is pass it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.880
 to the mesh 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.939
 let's make the hole where 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 we will place the rubber band with the help of 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.450
 sack, bag 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.560
 now what we have left is to cut the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.160
 enough unity for the head 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.620
 and enter it 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.620
 through the holes we have made 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.489
 we will go around here we will make several 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.489
 knots so they do not come out 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.740
 we have to have something like this around here 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.069
 are the knots we are going to turn it around 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.560
 we put the rubber back and already 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.289
 we have the batman mask finished 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.680
 with the rest of the masks and the 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.740
 ninja turtle mask we will do 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.830
 in the same way and we will have a 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.409
 mask made by ourselves from 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.990
 Very simple way to enjoy 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.780
 carnivals so nothing else this has been 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.020

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.719
