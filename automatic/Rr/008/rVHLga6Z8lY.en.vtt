bloomsburg<00:00:03.449> acidity<00:00:03.899> only<00:00:04.350> one<00:00:04.529> change<00:00:04.890> but

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
bloomsburg acidity only one change but

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.540 
bloomsburg acidity only one change but
it's<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.089> really<00:00:06.450> good<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.990> which<00:00:07.319> um<00:00:07.589> well<00:00:08.340> has

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
it's a really good one which um well has

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.250 
it's a really good one which um well has
me<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> bit<00:00:08.880> excited<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.630> think<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.230> lot

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
me a bit excited and I think that a lot

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.180 
me a bit excited and I think that a lot
of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:11.509> more<00:00:12.509> hardcore<00:00:13.170> users<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.710> guess<00:00:13.920> which

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
of the more hardcore users I guess which

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.609 
of the more hardcore users I guess which
didn't<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.389> recent<00:00:16.350> patches

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
didn't really like the recent patches

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.170 
didn't really like the recent patches
which<00:00:16.920> made<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> game<00:00:17.310> easier<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> love

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
which made the game easier going to love

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.490 
which made the game easier going to love
this<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.390> hardcore<00:00:21.390> mode<00:00:21.630> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
this so what this is is hardcore mode so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
this so what this is is hardcore mode so
this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.189> option<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.789> ticket<00:00:24.390> or

thing<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.750> does<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.500> believe<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.190> like

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
thing that this does I believe I'm like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.160 
thing that this does I believe I'm like
the<00:00:51.090> recent<00:00:51.480> patch<00:00:51.719> which<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.730> increased<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
the recent patch which are increased the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
the recent patch which are increased the
the<00:00:55.170> cash<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.980> from<00:00:56.010> pops<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the cash that you get from pops for the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.049 
the cash that you get from pops for the
first<00:00:57.000> fourteen<00:00:57.449> rounds<00:00:57.629> by<00:00:58.520> ten<00:00:59.520> percent<00:00:59.550> i

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
first fourteen rounds by ten percent i

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.160 
first fourteen rounds by ten percent i
think<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.500> removed<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.960> get

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
think that was removed so you just get

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.250 
think that was removed so you just get
the<00:01:04.409> regular<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> initial<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.900> cash

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the regular like the initial one cash

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
the regular like the initial one cash
per<00:01:07.560> pop<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.310> fourteen<00:01:08.670> rounds

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
per pop for the first fourteen rounds

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.170 
per pop for the first fourteen rounds
instead<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.360> 1.1<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.490> also<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> has<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> old

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
instead of 1.1 and also it has the old

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
instead of 1.1 and also it has the old
round<00:01:12.450> generator<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.110> before<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
round generator from before this so the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100 
round generator from before this so the
balloons<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.880> being<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.270> clustered<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
balloons are being more clustered and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
balloons are being more clustered and
stuff<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> start<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.299> doesn't<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
stuff at the start so this doesn't this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.999 
stuff at the start so this doesn't this
doesn't<00:01:19.020> particularly<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
doesn't particularly make it actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.630 
doesn't particularly make it actually
like<00:01:20.460> incredibly<00:01:21.360> hard<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like incredibly hard but it kind of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160 
like incredibly hard but it kind of
returns<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> difficulty<00:01:24.840> before<00:01:25.140> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
returns it to the difficulty before I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
returns it to the difficulty before I
guess<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.670> um<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.390> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
guess so it's um so you know it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390 
guess so it's um so you know it's
possible<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
possible you can do it now but then

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.870 
possible you can do it now but then
again<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.869> apparently

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
again there is also apparently

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.370 
again there is also apparently
apparently<00:01:33.020> prices<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.229> increased<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
apparently prices are increased to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
apparently prices are increased to
increased<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> prices<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.670> hum<00:01:39.000> hard

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
increased like the prices in hum hard

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.130 
increased like the prices in hum hard
mode<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.549> yeah<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.119> towels<00:01:42.329> their<00:01:42.720> prices

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
mode so yeah all the towels their prices

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
mode so yeah all the towels their prices
are<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.680> expensive<00:01:44.509> some<00:01:45.509> Thai

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
are actually more expensive some Thai

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
are actually more expensive some Thai
some<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> hydro<00:01:46.229> tax<00:01:46.409> might<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.860> be

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
some of the hydro tax might actually be

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
some of the hydro tax might actually be
impossible<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.509> haven't<00:01:48.899> really

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
impossible I don't know I haven't really

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
impossible I don't know I haven't really
tested<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.799> yet<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.250> yeah<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
tested this out yet but yeah all the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
tested this out yet but yeah all the
towers<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.960> expensive<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.270> as<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> can

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
towers are more expensive so as you can

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
towers are more expensive so as you can
see<00:01:54.630> ya<00:01:54.860> they've<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.009> been<00:01:56.159> upped<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> little

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
see ya they've just been upped a little

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340 
see ya they've just been upped a little
bit<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> need<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.140> money

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
bit so you're going to need more money

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.020 
bit so you're going to need more money
in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> first<00:01:59.130> place<00:01:59.310> you're<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> need

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
in the first place you're going to need

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999 
in the first place you're going to need
more<00:02:00.329> money<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.930> towers<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
more money to get your towers and you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.789 
more money to get your towers and you
don't<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.579> much<00:02:02.700> money<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.810> um<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.350> guess

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
don't get as much money so um I guess

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.410 
don't get as much money so um I guess
farms<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.670> quite<00:02:06.000> important

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
farms are going to be quite important

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.059 
farms are going to be quite important
for<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.600> mode<00:02:06.840> maybe<00:02:07.229> forest<00:02:07.680> tiles<00:02:07.890> will

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
for this mode maybe forest tiles will

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.499 
for this mode maybe forest tiles will
actually<00:02:08.399> become<00:02:08.580> some<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> harder<00:02:09.360> ones

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
actually become some of the harder ones

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.270 
actually become some of the harder ones
I<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.440> i<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.950> they're<00:02:11.190> still

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I don't think so i think they're still

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.640 
I don't think so i think they're still
going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> hit<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> easiest<00:02:12.060> um

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
going to hit the easiest um

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
going to hit the easiest um
yeah<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.400> will<00:02:14.640> probably<00:02:15.230> make<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
yeah this will probably make a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.979 
yeah this will probably make a
significant<00:02:17.040> impact<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.610> maps<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.360> some<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
significant impact on maps we some of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.979 
significant impact on maps we some of
the<00:02:19.200> maps<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.920> mountains<00:02:20.700> maybe<00:02:20.909> but<00:02:21.810> then

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the maps like mountains maybe but then

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.289 
the maps like mountains maybe but then
again<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.319> generally<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.879> maps<00:02:24.060> where

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
again like generally the the maps where

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.929 
again like generally the the maps where
you<00:02:24.510> can't<00:02:25.409> cardboard<00:02:25.980> farms<00:02:26.400> those<00:02:26.700> are

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
you can't cardboard farms those are

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.660 
you can't cardboard farms those are
generally<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> easier<00:02:28.170> ones<00:02:28.409> from<00:02:29.189> what<00:02:29.519> I've

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
generally the easier ones from what I've

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.479 
generally the easier ones from what I've
seen<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.379> forests<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.530> mountains<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.129> think

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
seen a forests and mountains I think

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.640 
seen a forests and mountains I think
that<00:02:32.640> might<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.819> all<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.180> them<00:02:33.409> can't<00:02:34.409> remember

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
that might be all of them can't remember

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.020 
that might be all of them can't remember
off<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.769> top<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.040> head<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.250> those<00:02:35.609> are<00:02:35.849> all

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
off the top of my head but those are all

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.839 
off the top of my head but those are all
really<00:02:36.060> easy<00:02:36.810> tracks<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.470> general<00:02:37.859> so<00:02:38.609> anyway

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
really easy tracks in general so anyway

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.630 
really easy tracks in general so anyway
yeah<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.629> hardcore<00:02:40.290> mode<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:44.430> bring

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
yeah this is hardcore mode just bring

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.970 
yeah this is hardcore mode just bring
that<00:02:44.790> up<00:02:44.819> again<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> yeah<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.950> just

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
that up again so yeah you can just

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
that up again so yeah you can just
easily<00:02:47.370> ticket<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.389> want<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.659> do<00:02:48.780> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
easily ticket here if you want to do it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.750 
easily ticket here if you want to do it
as<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.409> see<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.950> doubles<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.430> straight

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
as you can see it doubles that straight

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.270 
as you can see it doubles that straight
away<00:02:50.790> twice<00:02:51.659> as<00:02:51.840> many<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.379> Queens<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.129> bloom

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
away twice as many of Queens and bloom

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.680 
away twice as many of Queens and bloom
stones<00:02:53.549> for<00:02:53.760> regular<00:02:54.090> tile<00:02:54.299> if<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.569> do<00:02:54.629> a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
stones for regular tile if you do a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.599 
stones for regular tile if you do a
monkey<00:02:54.959> verse<00:02:55.139> monkey<00:02:55.560> apparently<00:02:56.430> you'll

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
monkey verse monkey apparently you'll

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.250 
monkey verse monkey apparently you'll
win<00:02:56.819> twice<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.329> much<00:02:57.510> honor<00:02:57.780> from<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.170> as

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
win twice as much honor from that as

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.740 
win twice as much honor from that as
well<00:02:58.439> but<00:02:59.129> I'm<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.579> believe<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.180> won't<00:03:00.420> lose

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
well but I'm I believe you won't lose

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.229 
well but I'm I believe you won't lose
twice<00:03:01.079> as<00:03:01.290> much<00:03:01.439> honor<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.549> you're<00:03:02.909> not<00:03:03.030> you're

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
twice as much honor so you're not you're

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.720 
twice as much honor so you're not you're
not<00:03:03.269> taking<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> huge<00:03:04.230> risk<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:05.129> are<00:03:05.159> taking<00:03:05.310> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
not taking a huge risk you are taking a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.190 
not taking a huge risk you are taking a
risk<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.239> will<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.450> harder<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.109> are

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
risk that it will be harder and you are

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.780 
risk that it will be harder and you are
more<00:03:07.379> likely<00:03:07.439> of<00:03:07.920> losing<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:08.639> not

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
more likely of losing but you're not

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.699 
more likely of losing but you're not
risking<00:03:09.030> losing<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.840> honor<00:03:10.019> which<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.439> great

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
risking losing more honor which is great

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.289 
risking losing more honor which is great
so<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.340> going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.519> bring<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.879> more<00:03:11.909> on<00:03:12.180> it

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
so it's going to bring a lot more on it

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.929 
so it's going to bring a lot more on it
into<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.599> system<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.859> yeah<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.040> hope<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.489> some

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
into the system so yeah I hope that some

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.610 
into the system so yeah I hope that some
of<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.209> uses<00:03:15.599> out<00:03:15.750> there<00:03:15.989> who<00:03:16.139> think<00:03:16.409> in<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
of you uses out there who think in the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.869 
of you uses out there who think in the
game<00:03:16.769> was<00:03:16.889> getting<00:03:17.099> too<00:03:17.220> easy<00:03:17.459> i<00:03:17.579> hope<00:03:17.730> that

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
game was getting too easy i hope that

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.250 
game was getting too easy i hope that
you<00:03:17.940> enjoy<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.389> mode<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.109> probably

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
you enjoy this mode and you probably

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.479 
you enjoy this mode and you probably
going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.590> able<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:20.010> lot<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.310> blue

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
going to be able to make a lot of blue

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.229 
going to be able to make a lot of blue
stones<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:22.049> I'm<00:03:23.239> general

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
stones out of it because I'm general

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.550 
stones out of it because I'm general
like<00:03:24.389> with<00:03:25.139> 3000<00:03:25.859> tiles<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:27.239> getting<00:03:27.930> five

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
like with 3000 tiles I'm getting five

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520
