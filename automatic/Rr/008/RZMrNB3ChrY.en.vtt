 "Listen to Marcelo. What are we doing at school? Translation and Subtitles: Prophet for ForcaBarca.sk 

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:10.281
 "We're in a driving school because they say Madrid players can't drive. 

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:14.261
 What funny! I'm so good that I can drive without a driver ... " 

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.401
 "You're here because you're more dangerous on the road than when Freddy Krueger hands." 

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:23.001
 "It's not true!" 

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:35.401
 "Good day. 

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:41.701
 What a funny car park you have. It's too small that I can't come on time. " 

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.101
 "But we don't have parking ..." "No? 

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.301
 So it had to be a reception. " 

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.001
 "Sergio, how do we change the wheel?" 

00:00:54.011 --> 00:01:00.601
 "Replace Wheel? Everyone knows that when your tire bursts, you have to change your car. 

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:05.541
 That's why they tell me I'm a car dealer. " 

00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:07.001
 "It is true." 

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:22.401
 "Yes?" "Please pay attention to it. You're going to have a trial, damn it!" 

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.531
 "Sure, trial! I'm not going to go to court. 

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:30.461
 I will ask for a postponement as I will play the match France - Spain at that time. " 

00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:36.001
 "So you will have the court later." "I'm not coming again. I'll tell them I'll play a free vs. married match." 

00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:40.601
 "Then there will be a different date." "So ... I'll tell them I'm going to the TV show." 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.001
 "Boys ... Boys! Please be quiet. 

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:50.201
 Let's see... 

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:54.641
 at the intersection with the warning signs, who is the priority? " 

00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:58.401
 "I am rich." "No, it's not like that." 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.101
 "You are right. 

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.201
 Well, I'll have to pay the fine I get. 

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.601
 What's wrong with that? " 

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.401
 "You should give him more of those people's faces ..." 

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.201
 "Dear children watching CrackÃ²via ... 

00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:25.001
 You have just seen a clear example of who does not belong on the road. 

00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:31.541
 And what you can't do, my friends, not because it's bad or because you put human lives at risk. 

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.541
 You're not far from the right answer. 

00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:38.061
 You must not do it because you are not famous and rich. 

00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:41.801
 If you did, you would get into trouble. 

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:43.601
 Not fair? 

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.201
 Yes, just study nicely. 

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:50.001
 But I didn't study ... 

00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:53.701
 So why am I so smart? 

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.201
 It must be genetics. " 

00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:01.201
