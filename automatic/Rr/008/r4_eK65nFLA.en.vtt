00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
need to escape this prison cell and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.690 
need to escape this prison cell and
getting<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.420> TARDIS<00:00:40.050> which<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.399> there

you<00:00:43.610> larva<00:00:44.610> okay<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> sign<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:47.129> I

think the map will reset if you die or

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
think the map will reset if you die or
you'll<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> checkpoint<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.680> haven't
