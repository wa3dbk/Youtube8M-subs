gone for the low kick on the cradle II
or<00:02:22.150> maybe<00:02:22.390> predicted<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.049> switch<00:02:23.349> because

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
or maybe predicted that switch because

and<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.230> misses<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.709> seventy<00:03:15.639> percent<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.209> it

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
and it misses a seventy percent and it

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.259 
and it misses a seventy percent and it
misses<00:03:16.510> all<00:03:16.750> these<00:03:17.109> times<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.489> now<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.030> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
misses all these times so now I have to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.520 
misses all these times so now I have to
go<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.599> Draco<00:03:19.840> meteor<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.290> kill<00:03:20.410> that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
go for the Draco meteor to kill that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.349 
go for the Draco meteor to kill that
thing<00:03:20.590> off<00:03:20.950> which<00:03:21.459> will<00:03:21.579> waste<00:03:21.730> my<00:03:21.940> special

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
thing off which will waste my special

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.629 
thing off which will waste my special
attack<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> could<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.040> used<00:03:24.190> hurricane

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
attack so I could have used hurricane

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.039 
attack so I could have used hurricane
and<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.209> know<00:03:25.299> killed<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.810> off<00:03:25.900> without

wasting<00:03:26.319> my<00:03:26.530> special<00:03:26.920> attack<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:28.030> know

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
wasting my special attack but I know

wasting my special attack but I know
that<00:03:28.209> things<00:03:28.480> going<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.750> faster<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.230> i'm

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840

here's Aquajet I'm faster than him he
not<00:04:54.930> sure<00:04:55.229> if<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.560> awkward<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.070> would<00:04:56.190> kill<00:04:56.400> me

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
not sure if the awkward it would kill me

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.860 
not sure if the awkward it would kill me
at<00:04:56.639> this<00:04:56.760> point<00:04:57.060> but<00:04:57.240> I'm<00:04:57.360> gonna<00:04:57.479> go<00:04:57.660> for<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
at this point but I'm gonna go for the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.210 
at this point but I'm gonna go for the
cover<00:04:57.990> while<00:04:58.260> he<00:04:58.290> goes<00:04:58.500> for<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> super<00:04:59.040> power

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
cover while he goes for the super power

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.450 
cover while he goes for the super power
because<00:04:59.580> he<00:04:59.760> has<00:04:59.880> much<00:05:00.150> powers<00:05:00.540> so<00:05:01.460> again

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
because he has much powers so again

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.800 
because he has much powers so again
that's<00:05:02.610> not<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.090> be<00:05:03.120> enough<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.450> kill<00:05:03.660> me

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
that's not going to be enough to kill me

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.570 
that's not going to be enough to kill me
so<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.169> recover<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.770> next<00:05:05.070> one<00:05:05.160> again<00:05:05.400> I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
again while he super powers again

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.640 
again while he super powers again
because<00:05:14.160> he<00:05:14.400> has<00:05:14.490> well<00:05:14.700> power<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.590> what<00:05:16.590> do
