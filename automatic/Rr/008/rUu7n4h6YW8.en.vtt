 m 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.969
 good evening everyone 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 so it seems that I always quote but what do we do that jérôme fillol 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.929
 naughty philippe 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.759
 I want to say 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.539
 so I resume that for impunity 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.550
 he is difficult 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.410
 the lottery of the house 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 the house that suddenly opens 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 in innovation in national cups 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.340
 otherwise the coty firm 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 a small pond world do you figure I dug a little hariri yet so 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 that it was a coincidence that I myself created music 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 you check the director of the cube's ot 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.400
 of what I wanted to do more of the tree education in the world under 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.990
 the water 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.830
 I did not succeed 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.890
 percent because of 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.790
 of the small size of the same 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.530
 likewise the grandparents 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.260
 well 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.480
 the abscess 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.600
 so I just wanted to find out more about what it looks like 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.880
 dots 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 I think I'm going to sleep as they can 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.670
 and percent I 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.350
 8 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.350
 so I'm sure I'll have enough money 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.759
 all you suite 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.260
 she him this seen the fact that say this will only be what this house comprises 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.940
 so they have grown we are not in front 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.310
 quite a stage in the week 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.770
 any 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.110
 onem an attic room obsolete later in january 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.570
 and percent 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.370
 I forget piece 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.370
 j 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.999
 I think we will do without a stadium 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.260
 2 my bathroom and toilets and for that exile they put their 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.179
 grain 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.529
 wailers because musicians especially that 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.190
 in a book that I think we can do but 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.369
 - as soon as you touch I am a press release 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.529
 but it's not so short so be able to play tonight 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.349
 it demolishes gesi 7 so before we see 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.499
 what it gives 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.639
 finally 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.840
 I want to say that it's very very ugly the human cost that 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:45.689
 Sadly 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.069
 we can not have other ideas 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.239
 possible if we do not welcome found how we do 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.859
 all the better for them 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.199
 but the blues see that the Arctic basin extremely less dazzling 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.429
 south so seen from the outside 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:04.649
 that's what gives a boost the shock of the images pronounce on the 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.179
 manifesto 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:10.569
 for the big contest it is and extremely serious but I can not anymore 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.879
 doing otherwise 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.790
 everyone wish good luck to that person that she broke a 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.919
 window 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.379
 here 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.209
 so it's still a leak for the time so I did everything in stone on 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.299
 will see him fight with them with the rest 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.569
 the man already I can say that their door he was heading north 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.039
 art there are some who will say thank you compass moms 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.520
 for multitasking power off about a poor woman m here 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.840
 it's the second reading and the nuclear group write necessarily 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.189
 decisive 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.389
 you can check with all 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.389
 you all the Cuban all meetings are all happy like that 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.429
 a death situation 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.429
 you do not know where to look probably plane 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:04.929
 a reflection that when I was so my little brain tomorrow click here 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.940
 and so I thank that this is not what we can read 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.360
 one of those videos that explain pretty much to start the biggest so here 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.359
 like that 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.359
 so that's it for this day 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:22.559
 twelve obliged gold when one digs his sweetheart to know how does one do but 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.449
 there may be other other accounts that the world 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.349
 but I know him 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.089
 currently that I've been doing a year that I'm also waiting with a colleague 

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:35.050
 philippe toulemonde certainly 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.180
 before in prices 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 Monday the distributor because here we can allow to challenge it 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.469
 here 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.009
 I'm in my job the number of enrollees have worked with a 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.309
 wooden board or as cook who work on wooden boards 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.999
 see one day all that 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.330
 there I made my little garden 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.529
 that's enough 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:58.289
 I have proven his exasperated ccs but I believe I feel that 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.830
 awesome so remember the pickets 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.500
 my uncle the pillar taumoepeau here in a little pocket not to my girlfriend 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.490
 so I can 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.220
 here you do a little soap like that a match in usual return 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.879
 I'm not going because that's how I found all this unless we had 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.460
 one or two minutes that a few units 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.729
 nicolas bellemare 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.479
 but that my clients tell me that I am well surrounded since I am 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.020
 someone who likes to be 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.739
 to be cajoled our ratios that of Jewish personalities 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.339
 again, from the inside, it's so much prettier 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.680
 now we will see the benefits drama is a little more 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.289
 so here I was in peace steve 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.539
 that one 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.830
 - that contagion duceppe that does not need light 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:55.459
 there I put lights because we have a little decoration gently this sense 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.789
 testifying that more like this kind of house c 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.499
 the light no longer needs to clp the system 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.249
 it will serve for the future in Europe the disadvantages 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.960
 montebourg because they found m 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 so better for you 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.090
 no I mean meanwhile communion the problem often so 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.839
 it is of course the brightness 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.819
 but more is that it is very nice so we can go further better 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.479
 a 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.960
 afp source so for the actress finally I must find that it is wrong 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.940
 on the menu so that's why I hope you can throw the father 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.800
 moreover he continues 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.529
 his son and then 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.269
 it is precisely at rest are exasperated they want precisely 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:49.050
 in this idea 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.259
 according to one of his episodes of your boyfriend 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.110
 she just did not get any better as getting used to 1 we would have done well 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110
 the k -o a house on the pot 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.389
 but I want to emphasize Dad territory I tried 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.179
 myself I've done this to myself it's been three days since I killed directly 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:09.430
 yes because yes 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.659
 shrimp I'm available 24 of 24 almost 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.650
 here it states flowers coming from projects 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:21.699
 laziness 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.699
 m 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.499
 wayne i know i'm skeptical for me the fun 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:32.659
 my arm but what do you like it that those who would like to 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:33.459
 give good luck
